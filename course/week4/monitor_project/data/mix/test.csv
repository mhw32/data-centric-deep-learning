It is worth it for the top! It is really flattering but the highwaisted bottoms just hit at an awkward area for me. I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C.,1,0

"2006 Honda Accord sedan. Had a difficult time trying to install unit. Fully assembled, the unit was not fitting into the small space. The arms were hitting and I could not get it to go in. Not sure if this is the way to go, but I disconnected the rod from the motor gear so I could ""flatten"" out the linkage. Once I did this the unit slid into place very easily. The only hard part was reconnecting the arm to the motor gear. You have just enough room to fit your fingers in behind the linkage. Then you have to press, HARD, to get it to ""snap"" into place on the ball. Other than that issue, everything seemed to go smoothly.",1,0

It was relatively easy to assemble this spice rack following the instructions. I love that the height is adjustable because when I initially set it up it didn't fit where I want it. But no problem it was easy enough to adjust the height and now I have a very organized pantry. Very happy with the purchase!,1,0

"This is a handsome looking knife, but it has some fatal flaws. The locking feature broke within a few days of receiving it. This is too small a knife and too sharp an edge to have the blade swinging freely without the ability to lock it open. Also, this is a really heaving object for it's small size, making it pretty much useless as a knife you would carry around, which is kind of the purpose of a small knife like this. I had to send it back for a refund.",0,0
"This is great for my life proof nuud case. I see it doesn’t cover the full screen entirely but it’s very slight and doesn’t impair functionality. It is working great so far I love how sleek the screen feels, almost naked like if it was the iPhone glass itself. I give it 5 stars due to the fact I already dropped it twice on its face and it still hasn’t broke on day one! I will keep u updated on the wear and tear over time.",1,0
"its like a legit Sanwa replacement part, high quality. Thanks!",1,0
"OK, you would think I would return it - however, the issue was that the gem in the middle was not attached, had come loose. Whatever they stuck it now with didn't hold. Crazy glue holds it just fine. so - for a cheap item, it's just fine.",0,0

"I might've been happier if my guaranteed set wasn't hot pink, but overall it is what I expected: some weird color combos (lots of half/half and speckles), a few really excellent dice, several D6 with pips instead of numbers, and a few factory seconds that are chipped along the edges or have paint issues. I'm going to end up repainting the excessively ugly dice that were included, but overall definitely worth the cost and the fun of opening up the bag and seeing what you got.",1,0

A nice solid headphone hanger! Spring loaded to clip on to most desk / surfaces. It has 2 foam pads for both grip and to protect the surface that you clip it to. I like that it has a cord holder built in to keep your cord secure. The bottom bracket swivels 360 degrees for use with almost any desk or table.,1,0

"Put these under my kitchen cabinets. Hardly any hiccups for this DIYer. Bought the extension wire, 90 degree clips, and connector pieces, these were just OK. Nexlux could have a better description of what other pieces are required to do things like connect the lights to the extension wire and then reconnect after running behind cabinets and into a soffit etc. That part was tedious and cost them a star.",1,0
It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer.,1,0
"Wow, I must say I’m impressed with how these came packaged and presented. They include instructions that give a link to a quick video on installation. I have applied many varied screen protector products. I found it really cool that I could feel confident ordering this for my mother or anyone else who doesn’t necessarily have experience with devices OR accessories. I’m giving 5 stars because everything came as described and I’m just impressed with the packaging for ease of installation.",1,0

"All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can't really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it's overall usability.",1,0

"I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.",0,0

"There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made.

The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,1,0
"Well, the mother card came damaged and I can not return it because I'm from another country and the cost of sending the package is greater than the price of the card, so it's not worth it. The card is beautiful and comes well packaged, but unfortunately it came damaged from the factory, it does not turn on or the LED lights that it has on the part of the external connectors. The criticism is for those people who buy the items internationally, bear in mind that they can lose their money if it is damaged and the cost of returning it to amazon is much higher than the price of the item.",0,0

This printer is horrible. It's way too complicated and is constantly giving error messages. The printer drawer and output drawers are very cheaply made.

I Iike how you can convert it from rectangular to square. It hasn’t been running long, but so far it hasn’t heated up a lot.

"I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired.

"Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5’8’’ size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it’s for not showing anything on the front? But it’s stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it’s waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I’m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it’s wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it’s a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee.",0,0

"This product is great, but the instructions suck... also, it took me and my brother over an hour to figure out why the Power Magic Pro wasn't working. We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going. I recommend turning on the engine to jump start it and then try to see if it works in parking mode when you turn the car off. Other than that, this product is awesome! The images are extremely clear.

This product didn’t provide a strong thumb grip. It is still slippery and just didn’t function as it is suppose to be. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you are a serious gamer.,0,0

True to color and a great size. The adhesive is actually very strong. Properly clean the surface before attempting to install.

"Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.",0,0

Would recommend if bottom of couch/chair is small enough to cover with a single piece of fabric. Was really easy to unfold/install (we used a staple gun to attach). Would order again if a larger width is available.",1,0

"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed. As a result, the seat can actually rock side to side a little. This does not bother me at all when riding, and may actually be a benefit, but I worry that it will get worse as it wears. Regardless, what this seat post does is transform your hard tail bike into something you’ll will want to ride more, and it makes the bike more capable. I currently have it on a fat bike. I have another good full suspension trail bike, but I doubt that I’ll buy another FS bike, ‘cause you can get a hard tail and still have comfort if equipped with this post.",1,0

"let me start off by saying this is not a bad rating for the product but rather Amazon for not delivering on time. So my order was over 8 days ago and Amazon barely shipped my package. All I received was an email indicating that the package would be late. The website continues to indicate that there were 15 miter saws still in stock. So when I get the shipping email, it moves the date by 5 additional days. No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service? I questioned myself, why do even shop on amazon? I suppose with the other options I won't any longer.",0,0

"Update after 3 months: Still great. Comfortable & fits well. Just the slightest sign of wear on edge near point of attachment. No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later. The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2. I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise. So far there aren't any wear marks around the buckle. All in all a good deal.",1,0

This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs. I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera. The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA). But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.,1,0

After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me!

"I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router.

This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it,1,0

I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author's next book.,1,0

"This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",1,0

"Before purchasing and after receipt, I watched the video which was very helpful for setup. The stand is well made and all went together as per video. I have some difficulty in setting my phone on the stand. Not a case issue … the setting of the lightning cable seems a bit off straight. The support for the phone is adjustable to accommodate for different case thicknesses … it is the slight misalignment of the cable that seems the issue. I have set and reset. Not a deal breaker, just takes a bit of finagling to set the phone. All else works well. The only other ""issue"" is … there are still 3 cables out the back of the unit. Three white cables. I bought a black unit. I'm trying another stand and am on the lookout for a cable wrangler - probably a solvable problem. If nothing else, I can wrap the cables in black electric tape. Honestly, there does not seem to be 1 perfect solution, but what I really like about this stand is how it holds the watch.",1,0

"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",1,0

I also purchased one of these in July of last year, and it completely died with no reason or warning. It wasn't dropped or abused in any way, just completely stopped working, even with new batteries. That's what led me to purchase this one, which adds a ""1"" to the numbers you're typing in if you hit any of the numbers close to the 1. It also seems to omit numbers that you feel like you've typed, so the keys on this one are very inconsistent and temperamental. Technically it works, but not great.",0,0

Nothing special at all about this product... the book is too small and stiff and hard to write in. The huge sticker on the back doesn’t come off and looks super tacky.

"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",1,0

I’ve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription. When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can’t do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there’s motion and it can’t distinguish. It doesn’t even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really ineffective unless someone hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period.

"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash.",0,0

Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies.

"While this product is motion activated, I use it from dusk to dawn lighting of my drive-way. With it being LED I really haven't noticed much of an increase in my electric bill.

"I'm never buying pads again! I've been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They're super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies. These are soft, hypoallergenic, and super absorbent without feeling like wearing a diaper or something (at least, that's how I used to feel wearing pads). The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.",1,0
Exactly what you need to cut & strip fresh herbs and leafy greens. Easy to use and clean. Great safety tab that allows you to retract blades. Super easy to clean. Much better quality than others I’ve used & broken. Plastic could be a tad thicker to make it last longer - but at this price it can’t be beat that’s my only quasi-complaint. Still ranks as one of the best I’ve found after purchasing & breaking 2 other brands previous to this.,1,0

"I didn't know that Tony Hillerman's daughter had taken up the reins to continue his Leaphorn/Chee legacy - I used to love those books. ""Cave of Bones"" was pretty good and brought back fond memories of the books, the characters, and the Southwest country... I enjoyed that one, so I tried this one (the author's first effort). But it's pretty weak. Shallow characterization; repetitive; some too-obvious clues/details. Oh well. Somewhere between this book and ""Cave of Bones"" her style and plotting must have improved, so maybe I'll try a few others.",0,0

"The features are nice, when they work, which is infrequently. The Bluetooth range is short, which is fine. we all know what we're getting into with the Bluetooth game.

I have tried it 3x for smoking meat and it has failed in this way about 10 times. each time the only way i can figure it out is to notice that the temp stays the same for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, and then I must power cycle the device and force close and reopen the app. After i do this it starts working again.

It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.",1,0
"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable.

"Perfect for diabetic foot pain. My boyfriend has diabetes and I was tired of always rubbing his feet to ""push the blood out of them"". Now he sits on the couch for an hour each night wearing these, wondering why we never heard of these before!

I ended up putting a label on the right one to know which is which. I have tried them too, they are great.",1,0

The shelf life of the oriduct was missing on the container. There was no date on the container when it was made, and when it expire. This is very important.

So after playing with this watch all day I have to say not bad. Not great but not bad. I don’t like the fact that you have to remove the wrist band to charge the watch. Also that when lift to see the time doesn’t always work. When you use the watch to take a picture with your phone it doesn’t show you what the camera sees. It locates your phone with sound but if you use your phone to find your watch the watch vibrates which is useless. The other functions are ok but are a little glitchy. In the end It’s a nice cheap alternative for a child who wants smart watch.,1,0

"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",1,0
Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly. Last but not least was the only product that didnt allow me to return the item although i was able to return other products from this seller. Long story short the seller had to of know this was garbage and blocked the acceptance of returns so i had to call amazon to get this resolved. you get 1 start,0,0

I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size. Not sure if it’s how it is designed but feels heavy and bulky 2) the class that holds the buckle on slips. I like my belt tight but the teeth just dig in and the “leather” just pulls and stretches.,0,0

This product is worth the purchase and does what it says. Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target. If you purchase it you will see what I mean. If I'm wrong and there is a way then I still blame the manufacturer for not making it more obvious.,1,0
"Over all, a nice dog house, but contrary to what the description says, the roof does not come off. Ok, in theory one could take it off if one wanted to remove a bunch of screws and didn’t mind the whole thing falling apart. So, it really does not come off. That said, the doorway is huge and I don’t think it would be difficult to wash it out that way. The assembly was easy enough by following the pictures. Although a couple of screw holes didn’t line up perfectly, these were not much of a problem. I doubt that the house would be completely water proof - maybe - but I’m using it under a patio, so that is not an issue for me. I wish there was a door flap available.",1,0

"It fits the YI 4k perfectly, placed a lanyard on the cover and it has a couple of hole to tie it to.

"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",0,0

It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA.

You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma,0,0

This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product. I did however have a bit of confusion in the beginning because the instructions were not clear so I googled. You guys might have to google too if you've never used a garlic press before.,1,0
"I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars!

"This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that’s right RUST. Perhaps it’s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn’t bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn’t shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don’t get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though.",1,0

"These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head.",1,0

A very informative book to read. I would highly recommend it to those who is just starting. Give this book to all high school senior students!,1,0
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.,0,0

Ive just had the second one fail on me.....they last about 1-2 years then the LCD starts to fail. I was smart and purchase Asurion insurance with the second one......just filed a claim now - bext $4 ive purchased :) Almost feel bad making the claim as i knew probably was going to fail based on previous experience. This said....when its working the la Crosse unit is very functional and stylish.....this said they've now withdrawn it from their line....i assume because they kept failing/return rates.,0,0

"This has performed quite well. We bought it during the fires in Northern California when we were having very bad air days. What's amazed me is how much dust it picks up from the air itself.

"Después de usarla edito mi opinión. Para mi no vale la pena. Cuando pasas la mano parece suave. Pero no. El entrelazado de los hilos rasca mas que el algodón normal. No se si con el uso mejorara.

"Two problems, first of all, the mounting holes for the speaker grilles DO NOT line up with the speaker mounting holes into the box. Second problem, how do you mount the crossover network???

"Funciona genial. Hemos tenido suerte y hemos podido escuchar al bebé desde la semana 10.

"It might not be something you should use by itself, there needs to be a stretch and strengthening routine coupled to it, but I will say, that I have been suffering from low back pain, from a bulging disc, and this brace takes a lot of pressure away from my discs by modifying my posture. I can stand for longer, I can sit for longer, and I don’t even feel the constant presence of pain in the area while I wear it. Even though this targets my upper back and shoulders, it has provided great relief to my lower back. It didn’t solve my issue, but it helps a lot.",1,0
"I'm very happy with these scissors. They are small (as most have stated) but are super sharp. The finger slots are great and feel like a smooth soft rubber. I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them.",1,0
"With a brand like Little Tikes, I am shocked at the quality. The handle bar is very loose and wiggles when you try to push. This makes it challenging to pivot when needing to turn. There is also a defect on the handle where the plastic is super sharp. The size of the seat barely fits my one year old and does not look comfortable. I had the Step2 car for my daughter and am upset I didn’t order the same for my son. The only reason I didn’t was because I liked the idea of the canopy!",0,0

"First, the button for the crown only works to scroll. The watch didn't charge while it was the case. It actually lost power. The Philips head screwdriver could barely turn the the screw that holds the case tightly together because one of the legs of the ""+"" is missing. I have my own set of small screwdrivers so I was able to loosen and tighten the screw. To me the case took too much away from the watch functions for me.",0,0

Purchased light in April 2019 and really enjoyed it for 3 months. Then the dimmer/brighter switch sensor stopped working. Then it started turning itself on & off. Have it now set at brightness I can tolerate-will only work properly if I unplug it when I use it! Would not recommend.,0,0

"I was fairly happy with these LED's when I purchased them in March of 2018. My only complaint at that time was they were not dimmable as advertised. My fixtures had low and high settings, and the lights would flicker badly when set to low.

"Ok, so I heard that this could be used in the backseat for cup holders if your vehicle doesn't have them.. um. no. The fastening slots are open at the bottom, plus they are small, so lacing a seat belt through is pointless. Comes off immediately. It's lightweight so it will fly off the seat if you stop even slightly suddenly. I'm giving 2 stars because it is sturdy, lightweight, and inexpensive- but it's fastening system means it is not secure in your car.",0,0

"Cute outdoor lanterns. I purchased two rubbed bronze ones. They have a black and gold color to them. They are not too bad for the price. I paired them with a real black, metal lantern and it’s hard to tell that they are plastic. The candles are bright. I like the timer function. I don’t have to turn them on/off every night and they come on/turn off at the same time. As you can tell, the candles look almost as good, if not as good, as the Luminara candle in my metal lantern. They were well packaged and arrived quickly.",1,0
"Well, I’ve ordered a ton of plants from Amazon, and this one came in the worst shape. They should have sent me a different one.

For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me. They bag and roll behind the knee with the extra material and don't lay right since they are too long. I would also suggest to size down since they run big in my opinion.,0,0
Nice looking watch but fell apart the first time it was worn.,0,0
"For the price, this is a great deal. I'm a little nervous about reviews saying the turntable stopped working - Hoping I won't need to use it for long, as my intent is to transfer all vinyl and cassettes to my computer. If you want to hook up speakers to the unit, you'll need to use speakers that connect via the headphone jack - most computer speaker sets would work.",1,0
"The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you’re finished weeding! It’s so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they’re aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it’s okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate 😏 Possibly it’s old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don’t either!",0,0

The screen protector was ok until I dropped my phone two days ago. I used this product along with a Mophie case.

"Its good, does the job but a bit too thin. You need to be gentle otherwise it will tear. If its a critical job, dryer vent for example, you will need to double or triple it. 3M Heavy Duty is still the best though, so if quality is more important to you than cost, then thats the way to go. For every day jobs, regular duct work, this is fine.",1,0
This was not the shoe I ordered. The lacing system was not as depicted in the photo. Instead of eyelets there were nylon straps that broke when I first tightened them.,0,0

"There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2"" too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can't wait to fire up the grill!",1,0
"Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder.",0,0
I would give this zero stars if I could. This is 6.3 you ounces of low grade chocolate for $60. My 9 year old daughter was so disappointed. It didn't even have a different piece for each day.

Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",1,0

"I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.",0,0

"Crayola 12 count colored pencils hold up well to the pressure on the paper. The tip does not break easily and the colors are very vivid as expected with this brand. The downside is that the pencils are the standard size and not really great for young elementary and preschool age. A smaller (length pencil) would have been better. I don't feel like sharpening the pencil all the way down for each one, so it works well enough for now. This brand consistently makes good coloring items and this is no exception. I just think I would have spent a little more time researching the length of the pencil in the future.

"I've been using these gripper gloves for years now, but this year the ones that arrived have some very odd shapes for the phalanges. The thumb gripper section now curls inward so that part of the thumb joint isn't protected in the inside but the outside of the knuckle is covered and irritated by the rubber. The same goes with the fingers and the Large gloves aren't very large any more and I had to struggle to get my not-so-fleshy fingers into the gloves. It would be nice if the sizes were just a bit smaller, but with the odd shapes I don't know if I'll be repeating an online order for these next time and instead find them in a local store so I can try them on first.",0,0

This will not help you with finding anything at all. It doesn’t offer any true guidance. Just some basic questions and you write your response. It’s just a journal nothing more. Very disappointed.

This mouse claims to have an internal receiver.

I bought 2 of these for my 2 new iPhone 8s and this mount holds the phone securely to the magnet and charges the phone without an issue. Problem I have with both mounts is the phone starts to droop down as I'm driving from the weight of the phone.

I thought maybe I could set an alarm every hour but you can only set one alarm... on a smart watch... how does that make any sense? Anyway, it'll sync and it'll chime when I check a chore off from the phone but the watch itself doesnt remind him of the chore which was the whole idea.

This case is very attractive. It holds and secures my phone nicely. I love the way it looks. Very classy. I have a black j7 so this case matches it perfectly. The downsides are the inside card holder. It's a very delicate mesh that rips easily resulting in cards falling out when using the phone not good ! so you have to be very careful not to overload and rip the sides. The magnet could be more magnetic it doesn't hold the case closed very well. The strap is very thin I had a sturdier black strap that I use on it instead of the one that comes with it. I am on my second one and although they do not hold up too long i like the look and the fact its not heavy. My first case lasted about 3 months before it ripped and looked a little worn around the corners.,1,0

The first one I thought was a fluke but after 10 or so came apart I was concerned . Without eye protection someone could have a serious accident ,I was hit twice in the face as they flew apart. They are separating at the seam and the band of grit is coming loose from the belt. I don't know if somewhere along the line they got wet,or they are not rated for the speed of a simple dremel band rotary tool. The cheapest single speed tools on the market still go at the 25,000 rpm range ,( which was the speed I was using). If these bands are not rated for at least that speed they are no good for much of anything.",0,0

The only problem is that others, such as the aides at his assisted living facility, do not understand how to use it when it is on one-button program mode. I would have liked the amplified audio to be even louder, but that is mostly a problem because my father won't wear his hearing aids.

The case seems to be doing a decent job of protecting my phone but it is not very well made. It is difficult to take off and put back on. Overall feels like cheap construction. The kickstand is awful to work with. Once it's open and locked open you have to find the perfect way to close it or it doesn't work. Fingerprint sensor ends up awkwardly deep because the case adds about a quarter inch of thickness to the back. Overall very dissatisfied with this case,0,0
"The clasp edges are a bit jagged so should not used with fine materials, which is what I needed it for. I had to be very careful in order to use.",1,0

I am a size 10 and I ordered a L. It is huge and boxy on me. The sleeves are even too long ( I am 5'7 so its not that I have short arms). Maybe a small would have fit better. I would return it but I didn't try it on when I got it and now it is too late.,0,0

Niw that I have everything assembled, and without touching the down pipe connections, now the downpipe is over a half inch off. To make matters worse, the connecting joint is almost too big for the flares on the downpipe and to top it all of, the supplied hardware is almost am inch and a half too short.",0,0

"Please read all the reviews regarding installation difficulty. To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned. I hope this review is helpful! Good luck!",0,0

The only problem is that when I watch things, I generally watch landscape (main use for my iPad), and the stand just doesn’t seem to work well for landscape!

And the rhinestones are cute too, and I haven’t had any fall off, which was a fear before purchasing!",1,0

Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again.",0,0

"Michener the philosopher of the 20th Century clothed as a novelist.

"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",0,0

"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses. They complained that I had to pay the costs for the return myself, they are about $40. I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter. And then there are the extra costs. Conclusion: Who does not come from the states and on gambling stands then she orders you. No recommendation",0,0

Brought this as an Christmas gift for my son. Assembly was pretty easy I liked how sturdy the materials were. However it stopped working the first day he played with it.

"The set up was pretty easy and the DVD guide made very confident when it came time to set up. However, once I began filling up the pool I noticed ground was wet.

But boy was I happy when I needed to do a home repair. I plugged both into my laptop where I played the instructional video and stuck each light turned up full into the cavity of my washer. It was like daylight and the slim design allowed me to place the lights just where they were needed and get full illumination. When I first started working under my washer I was using my cell phone for light! If I had a flashlight at the time it would have been too heavy and awkward, these lights are very lightweight.",1,0
"Based on the reviews and the seller’s advice, I sized up to a M when I normally wear an XS/S. Unfortunately, the stitching on the shoulder of the M far surpasses my petite, narrow shoulders, so it sticks waaaay out and makes me look like a football player. When I bunched the material to fit my shoulder, it looked perfect. Therefore, even though this one didn’t work for me, I think it’ll be great when I return it for my true size. Not sure why everyone says to size up, as there is a plenty of extra material... It’s made to be a baggy crop top. Unless you have extra broad shoulders, just order your real size so that it’s a baggy crop top that properly fits and looks good.",1,0

"Dear Santa: Children’s Christmas Letters and Wish Lists, 1870 – 1920 by Chronicle Books What I like about this book are many things. Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about. love that they show color photos of a scene during the book. So much history: how the Santa letter came about over the years, the origins of Santa. Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children, living history section and a don't miss area before it gets into the letters. Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60's remember. So many fond memories over the years, what a treasure this book is.",1,0

"I've read all the Joy Ellis Niki Galena books and the first Jackman & Evans. Lost Daughters is the best of the bunch. I thought it was very well written (with the exception of a few typos), had a great plot, and the twists & turns kept me guessing. The only thing I don't like is her use of fictional towns rather than real places! As a Yank with a British wife whose family lives in the fens I've spent a lot of time running along the narrow fen roads and visiting fen villages and towns. I don't understand why some authors take their creative licence to the point of creating towns and villages. I'm sure most readers would prefer to see places they can associate with rather than contrived locations!!",1,0

I have not noticed improvement in the teeth after taking product for several months. Maybe I am not taking enough. I take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening.

"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",1,0

"This book was helpful for my review; however, I failed on the test. There were tons of practice questions for each chapter, but they are very easy to the point that you don’t really need to buy this book. When I took the TEAS, the questions on the actual TEAS were very different. Some reviewers said that the question on the book were similar on the actual TEAS, but they were wrong. I studied the cardiovascular system intensively, and there is no one single question about the heart at all. The English portion on this book is very different on the actual TEAS. In the book, it focuses on grammar and spelling. On the actual TEAS, it is more on ‘if the sentence is written correctly?’ Overall, I don’t think that this book is worth buying. Like I said, the questions on the book are very easy. They are more on common sense. Compare to the actual TEAS exam, you will have to think and reread the question again.",0,0

Overall, not too bad and the ""pollen"" catcher works very well. Update Had for little over a month. Magnet that holds the door has now come out and won't keep shut. Not very well made",0,0

"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...",0,0

"Initially the product worked as explained. However, after a several months the edges begin to peel up(I also have a case one it), I tried to fix it with no luck.

Next time I would buy the glass protector and deal a slightly less responsive screen (as some say happens), seems worth it to me especially now I am stuff with a cracked screen and since that one incident it was knocked out of hand and now theres a huge crack right in the middle.",0,0

"Buena funda y a buen precio. La he usado en las ocasiones que voy a campings con bastante polvo y me ha hecho su servicio al 100%. Cubre hasta abajo el coche, por todos los laterales y sin tocar en suelo en ningún punto. Cuenta con gomas elásticas en su parte anterior y posterior para que quede sujeta al coche, aunque no está de menos agarrar también la cinta que pasa por debajo de coche y las laterales que se atan a cada una de las ruedas. En mi caso, en días pocos ventosos, con la principal, la que pasa por debajo del coche, ha sido suficiente para que no se suelte y entre algo de aire entre el coche y la tela. En cuanto a la impermeabilidad me parece que es muy justa, resistirá pequeñas lluvia y rocío, empezando a entrar agua al de poco tiempo, aunque lo importante en mi caso, el polvo y otras suciedades, si que lo evita. En retrovisores y laterales cuenta con telas cosidas reflectantes para mejorar la visibilidad. No son de muy alta calidad pero hacen su cometido. Hablando de las costuras decir que están correctas, no están estupendamente rematadas pero las telas que componen la funda no se sueltan y para el precio y uso que tiene la funda no pretendía que tuviera más calidad y detalle. Viene con una práctica bolsa para guardarla aunque cuesta lo suyo volverla a meter, algo típico en éste tipo de productos. En general puedo recomendar esta funda ya que estoy bastante satisfecho con ella y encaja bien en el Renault Scenic IV en el que lo uso.",1,1

"Having been a fan since the beginning of this series,always looking forward to next book, was very disappointed with this book. Great lead ins,not enough follow thru.

Would have appreciated as much attention in the story as had been displayed years prior . Where the author had .great story lines and interactions, they have become shortened and far more time added to sexual interactions. Far more erotica than story,which is of course the easier route.

Only reason I gave a four is because putting a wrist strap on the same end as the electrodes makes no sense.

"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.",1,0

"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",0,0

"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",0,0

So overall I like this flag. The colors are bright and the material feels good for the price. Not cheap but I definitely wouldn't keep this outside in bad weather. The one bad this about this is my flag smelled awful when it came out of the package. I bought another flag with this one and they both have this weird chemical smell. It's give me a headache and they haven't even been up 30 minutes. I sprayed them down with odor neutralizer and it helped for a few minutes. Definitely try to air out your flags before you put them in a room or anything,1,0

I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.",1,0

Also kinda see- through. You can’t see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It’s jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc.",1,0

"I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.",1,0
"The plant shipped relatively quickly but without a heat pack. It shipped on a relatively warm day (45 degrees Fahrenheit) so it wasn't the biggest deal, but still. When I opened the package, the plant was completely wilted and had reddish-brown spots on the undersides of all the leaves. I was able to revive it, but overall I was very disappointed.

It produces far more that needed for that job. Which would be OK, I figure the excess will get pulled out by the central vent system that is in a nearby hallway, and be spread through the rest of the house and possibly give some benefits. But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more.",1,0

"1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.",0,0

"My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn’t budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I’m not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life.

"This is the story of a police night patrol featuring two (partners) officers. It is realistic and interesting -- depicts what officers do most of the time, and this makes it different. The novel is not a thriller nor a mystery, per se, more the routine of a night patrol. There is a human element as the reader sees into the lives and minds of the featured officers. As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series.

"Let me first explain why I chose this model over others. I don't like the vent clips - I do not think prolonged exposure to hot or cold direct forced air is good for the phone. Dash mounts (even the magnetic ones) require putting adhesive on your dash - no thank you. Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road. My best bet is in the middle, where it is slightly harder to reach, but at least if I'm using GPS it's easier to view than it is sitting in my cupholder or lap.",0,0

Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough.

So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions.

"What I received with this product was a fancy bottle of BROWN WATER that had a extremely slight scent of vanilla and NO VANILLA TASTE! It tastes like plain water. I tried working with the company as well as Amazon and the company REFUSED to allow a return of this disgraceful excuse for vanilla extract. I would not recommend Blue Cattle Truck in the future for any product. This is absolutely ridiculous that a company would not stand behind its product. So, now I have a $36 bottle of brown water to stand on a shelf and remind me that I was taken advantage of. I would rate the product a ""0"" but it won't allow anything less than one. Thanks a lot, Blue Cattle Truck.",0,0

"THis crib is adorable and my 3 year old daughter loves it, but similar to what other people had said, when we put it together the rail split in 3 or 4 places. I don’t really want to go to the trouble of disassembling and returning it, but I’ll be contacting the seller/amazon.",0,0
"If you are making a dish that needs to be stirred, do it with ease or you will tear the liner thus defeating the reason for having one. It makes cleanup so easy and leftovers can be lifted right out of crockpot and placed into leftover dish. Love them. Would give them 5 stars if they could handle being stirred.",1,0

"Great packaging and a nice piece of glass. Was happy until the edge of the glass starting coming apart after 3 weeks. No drops, no impacts with my new iPhone X, the glass literally just chipped off where I pull up from the bottom of the screen to go “home”.

"October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost. Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay. Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages. The plastic a missing on both. Told warranty expired!!!! Who would check every single cartridge when received???? BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!",0,0

"the purple in particular makes an excellent blush, but it goes on much lighter than I wanted it too even if you sit there packing it in for a long time. I use a white NYX eye primer so it goes on VERY pastel and hold up pretty well, I haven't tried getting it wet yet but that may make for thicker application.",1,0
These cards are lovely! Nice quality paper and the gold foil is beautiful! The envelopes are white while the cards are cream/Ivory so my only wish is that the envelopes better matched the card color.,1,0
"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.",0,0
"a los dos días de estar usando el aceite ya se notan los resultados. Yo lo he utilizado para cicatriz de una operación de tiroides y ya casi ni se nota. Por la noche la utilizo en la cara y las manchas que tenía cada vez están más claras. Una maravilla, lo recomiendo.",1,1

I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed! So I didn’t have to return it! The fabric does NOT puff up. Looks brand new even after wash! VERY SOFT! Wrinkle free as noted!!! Very white after washing with plain blue Tide detergent. Will buy again!!! AND AGAIN!! THANK YOU!!!,1,0

"The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn't have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.",0,0
At first I didn't care too much for this resin. But then I bought a better lamp and it works amazing! I noticed though if you leave it in for too long it does yellow a bit. But aside from that it's great!,1,0

Lucas. This book was interesting. I was surprised at how determined Lucas was to make Jasmine his. The issues Jasmine carried around kept her from having a relationship with any man. But Lucas wasn't taking no for an answer. I am glad she found out who her father was even though it was a shocker ! This book was a great read! *** I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book.

"The fit was perfect and I love the light blue color. However, after I wore it one time and hand washed and air dryed the suit, part of the material changed color. It has gray areas all over it. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why better material wasn't used because it felt great on!",0,0
"It Cuts extremely well. I'll give it a 5. The blade turned on the edge brownish, but I worked on it & it's okay still cuts. Good for the money for simple cuts. My observation. Adult supervision extremely advised.",1,0
"The quality is great, but the sizing is off. They run small. Also, make sure it fits loose on your male pup and that the elastic doesn’t rest directly on his privates..when it’s too tight, it hurts their privates and causes irritation, rash, bruising and scabbing. I learned the hard way. You will need to put an overnight maxi pad or something in there & wash them. I soak them in white vinegar & water before a cold water wash with free & clear detergent. Then hang dry. I bought a size Medium for my 12 lb. Toy Poodle and realized he needed a Large, so I am ordering again. I do recommend these, just go a size larger and don’t use long term.",1,0
"Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don't purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.",0,0

"I got that as a Christmas present for a 4 year old. For adults it's ok to put together but for a 4 year old not, it is to difficult to clip them together. The led lights would work only for a couple of days and then only partially. Out of 5 cars only 2 work ok, the others are very slow even with new batteries. It hurts to watch them struggling around the tracks and praying they make the round while the 2 strong cars crash into the slow once and push them around. All in all good idea but didn't go through quality control for sure. Big disappointment!",0,0
"This is the worst mascara I have ever tried, and I've tried them all. I never got the length that was advertised and then when I went to put a second coat on, it basically turned all of my eyelashes into one big lash--all stuck together.

"I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us. This season I bought the next size I needed. One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama. I returned it and the company sent me a new one.

I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.",0,0
"Sturdy and works well. The main problem is if you have imperfectly shaped apples, then you still need a knife to cut out the part of the apple core that the cutter sometimes didn't get, but that's how all the apple slicers like this are.

I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more of this series soon.,1,0

"I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan.",1,0

"I'm have thick curly hair that I have to apply a lot of heat to just to get it semi-straight. And because I use only coconut oil it tends to leave my hair with a cooked kind of smell. This spray works! I sprayed my hair all over one time and it immediately cancelled the coconut odor out of my hair. The scent smells so nice and it's lightweight. I could smell it for about an hour or two and then it faded, but It totally canceled all the odor out of my hair...no more cooked smell. And I can use a little bit every day every time I curl my hair and it doesn't dry it out or change the texture whatsoever.",1,0

Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it's more or less the design of the applicator I don't really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that's just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL,0,0

I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don’t slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn’t have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn’t caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while.,1,0

"I am very unhappy with the helmet I received, it came out of the box warped (the shape of the helmet was bent like it had been squished.) The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy.",0,0
"This case is very pretty, yet professional looking. The rotation is important for me and works well, and I also like having a stylus holder and pocket for business cards etc. As others have mentioned, it is difficult to remove, but I rarely need to once it’s set up.

The dress fits perfect! It’s a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.,1,0

I used two of them to stabilize 20 foot of waste line and they're doing the job perfectly so far. Very satisfied.,1,0
Very good product for the price. I gave 4 stars because it is a pain to tighten enough to keep it in place. The inside of the clamp should have some ridges so that it grips the spacers and will keep it in place better. Came from overseas and it was not mentioned online. I really did not like that. They had wrong address and it went to PA instead of MS. The shipper called me for directions and was kind enough to reroute it to me with no extra charge. It was slow to ship and it was very slow to arrive coming from overseas.,1,0

So after finally sitting down to print some documents I found that the cartridge has bands in it. tried walking through all the instructions on cleaning it however if a state that if it doesn't work then more than likely that cartridge needs to be replaced. So it was a waste of $100 on this ink. I WONT be buying from this seller ever again,0,0

"Perform very well, no rust after 4 weeks. Does not have the 2 threaded holes to aid removal as OEM Rotors did. Fit over center hub has more clearance than OEM so removal should not be an issue years from now. Applied thin coat of never-sieze to mating area.",1,0
"These nesting dolls are very pretty. Very nice work and that is why I'm giving them 2 stars. However, the second doll seems to have been shellacked shut. It is impossible to open. Even my husband tried prying them. It is impossible. I think it is ridiculous that the purpose of this toy is to be able to be opened (by a child) and they cannot even be opened by a grown man. I bought them even though I saw that in someone else's review, and I wish I didn't because they cannot be returned. So, now I'm stuck with a set of nesting dolls and I can only open the first one. Totally disappointing. **Update: Amazon came through for me and made it right and I really did appreciate that. Thank you, Amazon.",0,0

"This product is quite sturdy (metal not plastic). Easily installed. However the flow restriction is more like 70%. Using a 1/16 inch drill bit, I drilled a hole in the center of the perforated plastic insert. That increased the flow but not to rinse the shampoo from my wife's hair. Through measured process I ended up drilling 2 additional holes (12 and 6 o'clock) for a total of 3. Just like Goldilocks I got it ""just right.""",1,0

I was very excited to use these but found very quickly that they were crap! The salt got stuck under the cover and every time you turn the cover to adjust what size holes you are using the salt poured out and even when all the holes were closed it did the same. The salt also got stuck in the cap so when you opened to refill the excess salt got all over. I threw them out. I guess you get what you paid for.,0,0

"It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it. If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days. Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe. I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house. It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.",0,0

"The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel.

"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970. In my opinion this was his best performance of his career. Later, I read the book. I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers. They really followed the book. As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God."" She pays a heavy price for justice. The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely. And every actor was totally believable in his/her part. An incredible work of art.",1,0

I bought these sheets because i was looking for a brand new clean pair of sheets that where definitely cheap but good quality and i have found them they are the best sheets white just always looks so clean and i could say i can impress females because they are so easy to wash and how i said soft. i have had my pair of sheets for a little over 3 months and no regrets i love the sheets they have been washed more then 10 times already and still like brand new as i wash them more and more the softer they get i recommend the sheets to everyone besides the price is unbeatable they are phenomenal. i am about to purchase about 3 more pair of sheets for the guest room and for my roommate,1,0
