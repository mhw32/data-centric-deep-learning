"Although the one I received had a manufacture defect of an upside down image, it is cute and I have contacted the seller about it to resolve the problem. The canvas tote is well made and has leather strapping as handles.",1
True to color and a great size. The adhesive is actually very strong. Properly clean the surface before attempting to install. They take some patience and precision to install but the end result in beautiful and makes the space look more polished. We used them in our rv bathroom and love them. The color is dreamy.,1
De mucha calidad por su precio las brochas el pelo suave y agradable muy bien embalado,1
Buena calidad del sonido los recomiendo peque√±o y muy f√°cil de transportar El sonido sale en buena calidad y coge bastante bien la radio,1
I think this Pulley is better than the original one. Very sturdy made.,1
Very pretty earrings. Kinda big for me personally as a prefer smaller-sized earrings but will probably give a pair to my niece since they're v.stylish.üëç,1
"Me han llegado otros diferentes, blancos y sin cable. Nada que ver con los de la foto.",0
Es muy pr√°ctica y c√≥moda estoy contenta,1
Never received it! It days it shipped and delivered and I never got it. Contacted seller several times and they‚Äôve done absolutely nothing about it. I want my money back SMH,0
Not as protective as other speck cases,0
A gift for my mom on mother‚Äôs day and she loved it! She loves how roomy it is for caring a lot of things and how the look of the back pack is in general.,1
"Good on symptoms and diagnostics, treatment not so much",0
Siempre me sorprendo,1
My book club read this book recently. We all liked it for various reasons. This book provided us great entertainment.,1
"This toliet seat has been great for potty training! Fits perfectly and allows my daughter to have self sufficiency when she needs to use the toliet. I love the handles, very helpful for her, and the hook it comes with so we can have a clean place to store it while not in use.",1
Todo perfecto.. el env√≠o rapid√≠simo.. lo recomiendo 100%.. el m√≥vil es tal cual se muestra en la foto .. muy contentos..,1
Remote never worked. Can‚Äôt find a way to get a new one. Lights will not work,0
"My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn't eat these. Didn't like the smell of them and probably didn't like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn't like them and didn't want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can't recommend them.",0
I thought they‚Äôd be much softer. They‚Äôre not terrible but not worth the $$,0
I like the idea that there are words that an be used for many things. They cut clean with no problems.,1
"A great purchase. I was looking at pottery barn chairs but was so put off by their price that I looked elsewhere. This chair is very comfortable, looks fabulous, and great for nursing my baby.",1
"Igual que la foto, muy bien",1
"This should not be sold as a fitness tracker. I have had it on 36 hrs now and it says I haven't slept at all, the steps are very in accurate and the camera button does not work. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because so far the time has stayed correct and if I have bluetooth on it lets me know calls and texts but dont try to read texts because they only fash across the screen once and there is not a way to look at them again. Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies. Nice job on making a slim design watch that actually fits my small wrists.",0
Beautifully crafted. No problem removing cake from pan and the cakes look very nice,1
No me enviaron el color que ped√≠.,0
"I love these products so much! The material is so soft, and their designated are so cute! These sheets fit our crib mattress perfectly, and my baby loves to sleep on it!This is a set of two sheets, and they are very snug. You will not believe how soft these sheets are until you feel them yourself! I highly recommend these!",1
"Very thin material, the small fit very large, especially in chest. Not sure who this would fit it's just a strange design and material. For reference I am 5'8, 130lbs, 32DD. Provided no support as well and very flimsy",0
Loved these so much we bought a 2nd set,1
I got a thank you card asking for a review . Saying their a Small family buisness. I bought this as a gift and the boy loves it ..,1
Stupid story line & beyond boring!,0
Very comfortable perfect to correct the posture you can use hours without any problem my children like. because it gives them a better posture when sitting in front of the desk.,1
estoy muy satisfecho muy contento con el produto volvere a comprar en esta tienda ideal para lo que busco gracias,1
it worked great till the handle snapped in half and the screw the loosen/ tighten the amount of movement for the handle was broken. super upset:/ this happened the first time i got it out to test it with my canon t5.,0
Me vino en perfecto estado. Nuevo.,1
"Love this product! Taste great, dissolves nicely in cold or warm liquids. The best part that I love about this product is there is just 1 ingredient....beet juice powder....nothing else and especially no Stevia or other sweetener!!!!",1
Very fake looking. I sent back.,0
Not to well when u have to erase it,0
Horrible product!! My hair looked and felt so bad after using it that I had to wash it. Does absolutely nothing that it is supposed to do and I am a frequent dry shampoo user so I know what it is supposed to do. Either this product is counterfeit or just horrible.,0
I guess I‚Äôll be lucky to get one Christmas out of the tree. I didn‚Äôt plan on it being disposed after one use,0
AWESOME! Super heavy duty. Holds each set of keys on our event board. Exactly what I was looking for.,1
"This is a very neat phone/camera stick! what's great about it is that it comes with a very unique mini tripod that you can use to take group photos, yet it's as compact and about the same weight as a small selfie stick. I've used it in my recent ski trip and everyone was amazed by it, setting it up and taking pictures is super easy, and there is even a remote control for triggering the photo function. Overall I'm extremely happy with it and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",1
"This book was a great read. Fun and hot! The romance between the two main characters was sweet. The authors hit all the feels. However, the tension was a bit lacking. They tried but it just didn't work for me. Will read more from the authors.",1
"I enjoyed that Alabama Moon was a ""clean"" movie that the family can watch. It moved along and kept my interest.",1
Product was perfect shipping was incredibly slow...,0
Had to buy different filters because these wouldnt work with CV carbs,0
"Had this bowl for only 3 months and used it only 6 times when it cracked. I was washing it by hand and heard it crack. This is not a durable product. Perhaps the bowl is too big and makes it weak. I'm going back to glass for my ""go to"" large Mixing bowl- not fancy but durable!",0
These are really low quality.,0
"Outstanding, exceed my expectations!",1
Do not buy. Arrived open and popcorn was all over box! I want a refund or a replacement! Was also left in rain with no plastic on it so it was a real soggy mess on my porch!,0
biggest piece of crap i ever got on amazon.,0
"Proteger protege, pero por los bordes queda despegado dando una sensaci√≥n de estar empa√±ado por los bordes. No repetir√≠a la compra.",0
Have patience putting it on! Love the flower pattern.,1
"very stiff, still can't shape it well",0
I originally bought theses to workout in. The first two to three weeks were fine the battery lasted forever and I had no issues. One day the headphones died early during my run. I charged them the next day and they lasted a less amount of time. Since then they have been dead and I can‚Äôt seem to charge them. I have tried the cord that came with the head phones along with several other types of cords and no luck. I can‚Äôt charge the head phones and they‚Äôre worthless. Spend a little extra and get some good quality workout headphones.,0
Great for space saving. I bought these to store our extra comforter bed sets and blankets and I‚Äôve used 2 large bags and one medium and I‚Äôve been able to fit 2 comforter sets and sheet and most of our blankets in them.,1
Great football for teaching the little ones how to catch. Don‚Äôt have to worry about them getting hurt or hit in the face when catching cause this is extremely soft. My kids love it and they are able to grip it because its squishy.,1
"Very impressed by this screen protector! Many are hard to put on or get bubbles underneath them. This one was very easy to place and came with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, squeegee, and a dust removal sticker. The screen applicator has little tabs that you can hold to place the screen. Shipping was not incredibly fast, but the product seems worth the wait.",1
I have not received any shoes. Please check into this matter and refund my money without delay Thank you,0
I have only had these pens for two weeks and they are already severely dry and low on ink. I believe I have received defective pens. I would purchased from another vendor for a better return policy.,0
This was a gift for my son. He loved it and wants more,1
"Aunque encaja, no est√° dise√±ada para la Caja de los AirPods 2, por lo que me gustar√≠a que viniese detallado en especificaciones.",0
Very cheap items. They arrived broken and I‚Äôm very disappointed. I planned to do some meal prep this weekend now I have to make other plans. Some of them are actually cracked.,0
"These lump up after about a week, causing them to be uncomfortable.",0
The 1st cracked immediately after applying it to my phone. The second one was chipped on the bottom.,0
You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma,0
Typical Carhartt quality....first rate! What an awesome company! Never owned a Carhartt product that disappointed...and there have been hundreds. My last Carhartt wallet lasted 15 years! What else was I going to buy?,1
"Durmiendo entre las nubes... super b, d medidas perfectas tb... lo recomiendo. Super calentitas para este invierno!!! Buena compra !",1
La entrega en la fecha se√±alada sin ning√∫n contratiempo y el libro genial me ha encantado y me dio pena terminar el libro pues quer√≠a seguir en √©sa aventura,1
Super nice box!!! Got it next day!! Made really well .. I'm happy with it,1
"I installed this battery pretty easily on a compatible MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) and it was great for the first week or so. After that, the MacBook was incredibly unstable and would not stay running (even connected to power) for more than an hour before crashing. I did a bunch of troubleshooting thinking my older Mac was starting to show it's age in other ways, but to no avail. As a last hail Mary effort, I ended up putting the battery I replaced back in to the machine and it has been stable since. I am unable to return this battery at this point, but I definitely would if I could. Pretty much a waste of time and money.",0
The shakers are really cute but a little bigger then I imagined. No issues with salt and pepper spilling from the seams. After a week of adjusting to the size I absolutely love them. Really good price quality for the price.,1
"Excelente calidad de los materiales. Muy buena presentaci√≥n en lineas generales. Cables de muy buenos materias, se los ve muy solidos. El respaldo de JBL lo dice todo. Mi unico ""punto negativo"", el manual de usuario, es muy confuso porque estan todos los idiomas en una misma pagina, prefiero uno digital y con los idiomas separados. No es una tragedia. Lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados.",1
"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970. In my opinion this was his best performance of his career. Later, I read the book. I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers. They really followed the book. As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God."" She pays a heavy price for justice. The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely. And every actor was totally believable in his/her part. An incredible work of art.",1
Bought for my piano. Tuner would not pick up the top and bottom registers of piano. Also I felt there was too much variance of tuner itself when attempting tuning. Checked it against a tuner app on smart phone and many notes 5 to 10 cents off. Will send back.,0
"I looked at all the gloves and chose this one for price and quantity, its great to have two",1
We broke the original cup holders on our camp chairs and needed replacements. These cup holders were perfect replacements and are better than the originals.,1
Had this product for a little over a week and it stopped working. Never did work when you placed the phone sideways in it...super picky on placement when the phone is upright. Very upset that it doesn‚Äôt work after a week of use...DO NOT BUY!,0
"Era un regalo para mi sobrino. Tiene 8 a√±os y pedi la talla 12. Me mandaron la 12 de camiseta y di por hecho que el pantalon tambien era la 12 que es lo que pedi, cuando se lo di queda fatal, me habian mandado la 14 de pantalon.",0
Todav√≠a no lo he recibido.,0
"I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars! It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!",1
"I did not receive this item, what steps to take to have this item verified ?",0
"Es para lo que es, es decir, un viaje o poco uso. Tenemos mellizas y necesit√°bamos una peque√±a para cuando queremos ir a la farmacia o a la tienda s√≥lo con una",1
"Parece la t√≠pica historia de guerra en el espacio hasta que la historia da un giro bestial y te engancha. Por otra parte no he visto (Al menos en este libro que los personajes cambien con la historia ...). No obstante, es el primer libro de esta tem√°tica que cae en mis manos y me ha gustado mucho, el uso que hace de la gravedad, las aceleraciones, la f√≠sica que emplea es muy interesante",1
The large pot is too small,0
Will continue to buy.,1
"I love these headphones, when they work. I used them daily for about a week, at which point the left earpiece just quit working. It wouldn‚Äôt even charge. Talked to customer service, and this is apparently a fairly common issue. So I will return them, but because I liked them so much better than anything else available at a similar price, I will roll the dice and order a new a pair and hope I don‚Äôt get another lemon.",0
Love the series. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the whole series is not available on Kindle. üò•,1
"Bonitos y originales, pero, por el material que es, sobre todo el blanco se ensucia rapid√≠simo. No volver√≠a a comprarlo por este motivo.",0
"NOT worth the money or complicated install. Would never fully turn off and would drip non stop. Bought in Sept and the inside pieces already broke. Contacted Enzo for warranty help, they're willing to send replacement parts but we opted to just replace the faucet...",0
"Used with our three dogs according to directions. No apparent benefit for two of our dogs, and the yeast may have actually compounded the problem of allergies with the third.",0
This product is very pretty and I love the special clasps that make it easy to install on jewelry. However the magnets tend to come loose and have to be re glued and it is quite heavy so it tends to slip forward on your neck.,1
"Todos los d√≠as igual, si no saben hacer facturas no s√© par que venden en internet. cuando compras un equipo pues supongo que te da igual, pero cuando compras 100 ya necesitas factura y si no te la dan vamos fino, eso me pasa por comprar por aqui",0
Demasiado ruido y poco potente. Es util para poco m√°s que un armario.,0
Made from low quality materials. Very disappointed.,0
"the fan stop working after almost a month of using it, tried to change the fuse it still doesn't work, my 10 dollar plastic fans are still running overpriced piece of shit!",0
"Doesn‚Äôt stay put. Straight up fell down after a month and hit my kid on the head, then put a dent in the shower. Been 30 days, no refund available? Real chill, guys...",0
"Buena compra y facil de usar.La acabo de estrenar con unos nuggets con patatas y las patata finas salen crujientes como con aceite pero al no llevar grasa resulta menos pesada la comida.Al no llevar aceite te puede parecer el sabor distinto al principio. Hay q precalentar 3 minut la freidora y luego poner la comida. Menos mal que pedi la mas peque√±a porque es bastante grande.no la esperaba tan grande.Ya llevo mes y medio con ella y estoy encantada es r√°pida,c√≥moda no manchas la cocina.Los pimientos asados se hacen r√°pido y buen√≠simos y los bizcochos salen estupendos.He comprado el pack de accesorios y es muy pr√°ctico .Me alegro de haberla comprado ahora haces comida sana en menos tiempo y manchas menos y no tienes olores en la cocina.Hay que ir probando los tiempos para adaptarlo al gusto de cada uno.",1
"Very comfortable, although the material is a little stiffer than I had expected. I marked ""fit as expected"" but I purposely ordered one size below what I would normally wear. It's a bit snug, but I'm happy.",1
"Despu√©s de usarlo un tiempo puedo decir que es un producto de calidad, bonito y con un tama√±o, para mi gusto, que permite guardar todo lo que necesites.",1
"I've had this 3 gallon tank for exactly 1 year. The lights are still perfect. Filter still works perfectly. My major issues with the tank is the covering. The tank has a glass cover for the entire tank. It also has a thin black plastic cover for the filter. Unfortunately, the black thing plastic cover doesn't seal like the glass cover so it let's in dust, etc. With all that said, I LOVE THIS TANK. I want to upgrade from my current 3 gallon tank to a 10 gallon tank relatively soon. I won't be going with this brand for the 10 gallon tank because of the covers not sealing completely. With that being said, for someone looking for a fish thank that is small and great to have as a decoration, this 3 gallon tank is fantastic.",1
"Flawed disc, stopped about 5-10 minutes before the end.of the movie. Not up to Amazone standards.",0
"This product has problems; when you try to assemble it you quickly realize some of the drill holes (especially on the top shelf) are too close together by approximately 1/8 inch. The only way you can assemble this product is to forcibly bend the heavy duty wire retaining pieces until they slide into the drill holes. Even then, ""slide"" is not the correct word because you have to beat them into place with a rubber mallet: Assuming you are strong enough to do this, once beaten into place the bent- wire retainer pieces will try to spring open; this runs the permanent risk of splitting the wooden shelf into two or more pieces. If that happens this under sink shelf unit will not be a pretty sight!",0
Don‚Äôt but. This is very uncomfortable and it was in the garbage can by the end of the day. The fabric had a butch of small perforated holes (it is the style) and the skin would ‚Äútry to leak out‚Äù of it making it super uncomfortable within the hour.,0
Went pretty well. Hardest part was getting the case opened. The plastic tool didn't work so well for that. I had to improvise.,1
These were smaller than expected and the material wasn't very soft as described. They are also not high-waisted as stated in the description,0
"All tested and working properly upon arrival, seem to be just what I was looking for.",1
"I ordered the 2-pack, there was only one glass inside.",0
Smells AMAZING and feels super silky and smooth,1
"I will be returning this item. The bottom bracket does not adjust as per instructions. The charging indicator shows sometimes, but does not charge phone. This is a Galaxy S10 Plus, with a punk case. If the bottom actually adjusted this might have worked. Otherwise I very clever design but not fully thought out.",0
"I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I'll never know because he won't eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn't touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.",0
"No ajusta bien cuando utilizas el side swipe se mueve lo que dificulta su funci√≥n, material demasiado fino",0
"Works as expected. Well made, and seems sturdy. I would recommend this.",1
The are nice Bluetooth headphones!! The have great sound even thought out the house when i clean. They are light and comfy too. They are priced pretty reasonable too!,1
"Awesome product, perfect fit, keeps the dash protected and the car cool",1
"The saying was beautiful , the plaque is warped It cannot be placed on the base we have for our dog. Would like it replaced",0
It is a round label - not much to say,1
Very breathable and easy to put on.,1
"If you are looking for a good slight wedge pillow with back supporting incline this is not the pillow for you. I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow. Maybe it was not up to the company's typical standards. I am returning it with no plans on exchanging it for another of the same pillow.",0
"Don't waste your money on this belt, it lasted less than 2 months and already broke, i have to reinstall the old belt for now till I get a new 1, absolutely terrible craftsmanship on this belt.",0
This slime is not fluffy it was very sticky. The picture shows the slime swirled together and you cannot do that with this slime.,0
Too small...even for a child. Dissapointed,0
Pillow is very uncomfortable. Mine had a large lump of stuffing in the corner and the rest of the pillow was flat. I will not purchase this again.,0
"I really like these capris. I ordered three. I work out in them and because they don't look like workout capris, I can wear them with a long tunic and the whole outfit looks very nice.",1
"Bonito, no demasiado caliente, a menos que lleves un buen forro polar debajo, y al poco tiempo, se despeg√≥ uno de los velcros de los pu√±os. Pero por lo dem√°s, est√° muy bien. Viene con su capucha.",1
En la primera puesta se desgarr√≥ de na costura. Deja bastante que desear la calidad del producto,0
This product is very hard to use.,0
"The product here worked as a video cord and it did provide video to the TV. The problem I ran into was that I still got the same, poor display of video, but I think it's because the new TCL Roku TV, doesn't like older systems. Even my plug and play joysticks that I have don't show up as well on the Roku TV. The Atari Flashback works perfectly fine however on the Roku TV. Final Thoughts: I'll need to try and find a small, 15 or 19"" tube TV if I want to play my 93 Atari cartridges on an actual Atari console.",1
"I‚Äôve had my Mavic Air for 2 months now, flown it in North America and Asia in multiple environments and this has been by far the best accessory I have bought for my Mavic Air. It was quickly delivered, packaged efficiently, and fits the gimbal perfectly. Gimbal movement works great and no difference as advertised; glares are significantly reduced and shots aren‚Äôt overexposed thanks to the lens (see attached photos)! After looking through many other Mavic Air lens products, this is by far the best price and quality option...I would highly recommend it!",1
I bought this espresso set for my boss as a gift. It came in very nice and sturdy package. I was afraid that it will arrive broken from my last experience ordered glass item but didn‚Äôt have any problems at all. Great size. Not too small and it has very unique shape. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is vecause the leaf plate is a bit too smooth.,1
Just what I was expecting. Looks really cute.,1
Too large need to send back for smaller size,0
"Llevo desde diciembre con el adaptador y hace tres meses o as√≠ que no se oye bien, solo por un lado y si consigues la posici√≥n , muy mala calidad.",0
3 out of 4 failed within the first week. I think I still have one after a month or so.,0
"Todo Correcto, Todo como en la descripci√≥n, se escuchan muy bien es mas mejor de lo que pensamos,la tienda perfecta",1
"Perfect chairs for my home office! I wanted the swivel and no wheels. Reasonably comfortable, seat cushion is a bit like memory foam... great modern look. Easy to put the base on... four screws, and came with the tool.",1
"After 5 or 6 washings, these socks lost their elasticity at the top, causing the sock to fall inside my shoes beneath my heel. Find a better quality product.",0
should come with the glue to hold it in place,1
The individual packets inside damaged box appear intact but feel I now have to inspect each packet for tampering prior to using.,0
Trying to figure out how to use it from terrible instructions in broken English. I understand the concepts but have not seen the results.,0
Doesn't do what's advertised. Don't waste your time ordering this.,0
"It's been a long time since I've read a good shifter fated mate book. I really liked this novel. I just wish we had more time with the couple after the full moon, to show that the sparks between them continued.",1
the first pill about 2 hours latter i got a headache ...so i thought maybe i was getting a headache anyway after 3 in a row ...well it doesn't work for me !!!,0
The only reason this doesn‚Äôt get 5 stars is because it globs up in water making a thick paste. Otherwise AWESOME buy for the price. Works great in coffee and shakes but globs up and sticks to the bottom in a pitcher of water.,1
"I bought this twice. The first time, the longest two cords stopped working within a week or two. I ordered it again and the same thing happened. By the time I contacted amazon, I missed the return window. Amazon needs to ease up on the return window for certain products and stand behind their customers.",0
My son loves this. He loves playing with tools and always have issues with carrying them around. Everytime that I bring my tools out he wheels his cart out. It isn't as strudy as I thought but still great for the value.,1
"Really nice stainless steel pop, works perfect, the only way to make popcorn, we love our Great Northern brand, Best deal out there thru Amazon",1
"Not a typical Christmas story. Reindeers have different names, my kids struggled to follow. Also book arrived in poor condition.",0
Not very durable. It‚Äôs less than a week after Christmas and the blender is barely holding together.,0
"SUPER cute, design was just as pictured. Thin, you can see the print on the other side but not a deal breaker since its SO cute!",1
Much smaller than you think. Would be great if they were a little bigger.,0
"It took a little help for my 6 year old to get started, but he was able to complete it on his own. I don't know about replay value, but I 30 minutes to put together another 30 to show everyone his accomplishment. It was worth it.",1
No setup needed however this remote is useless as you can‚Äôt return to the home screen or bring up the tool bar.,0
"un movil muy vers√°til y estupendo tama√±o. quer√≠a algo peque√±o, ya llevo 2 a√±os con √©l y es muy bueno.",1
Product sucks. The stuff you're supposed to peal off won't come off. I wasted 2 trying to pray it off.,0
"Arrived busted in 2 corners and the box was ripped, looked like they were reselling a returned product.",0
"Love it! Arrived as stated! Fast service! All the straps, tie downs, and blind come with the Liberator Wedge/Ramp Combo. Highly recommended!",1
Like the taste of these a lot. Not super sweet but not bitter.,1
"Jason hand and body great smell great softness great moisturizing. But how it cam in the package where it must have been very hot they were very warm tubes, hope they don't loose any of their potency???????????",0
"Great sunglasses!!! Bought another pair of sunglasses and they were broken wi a week. These are durable, look good, great quality.",1
"The cuffs are exactly as the picture shows. However, I lost one with in the first hour of wearing them because you can not adjust the size.",0
really useful device works great,1
En un principio todo bien pero ahora ya no va. Tiene una mancha negra en el centro de la imagen.,0
"I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!",0
"Works and light weight, but easy to get all the sheets wet and clumped together which turns all the sheets into a thin bar of soap. Not user friendly, which is a bummer because they are light weight and work well as soap.",0
"Let me.start by saying when they say same day delivery, they are not playing ordered in the morning and got it later that afternoon. The tank is incredible good size has plenty of space It does not get in the way while you ride 2 thumbs up and 5 stars",1
"They did fit over my glasses, no scratches but quality of the frame material is cheap. Will not return as they will do.",0
Por el precio es un buen producto. De sobra para proteger el port√°til. Recomendable,1
They don‚Äôt even work.,0
"Est√° muy bien para uso escolar, y me encanta que es muy personalizable.",1
The sound was way off. It was almost 2 seconds off of the mouth or action.,0
Las medidas y los colores corresponden tal cual a la foto y a la descripci√≥n. Van perfecta en la estanter√≠a Kallax de Ikea.,1
"Quick read, good for busy moms who don't have a lot of time. Inspirational. To the point. Looking forward to reading more of her books!",1
This book as always did not dissapoint me. Action. Humour. Family. I have always enjoyed reading this authors excellent writing,1
I liked this product. On the top of container there is a 20% off second order. I scanned but did not receive code so I paid full price for second container. Disappointed!,1

"Es cierto que es barato, pero realmente no compensa mucho. En mi caso el nunchuck no funcion√≥ jam√°s. En fin, ten√≠amos un nunchuck de otro kit fallido y entre ambos completamos el juego.

I absolutely love this mask! Snorkeled in Mexico and everything was so clear! No fogging at all! I read a lot of reviews and researched other masks first before buying this one. This mask gives a realistic panoramic view and I felt so much more comfortable breathing normally rather than traditional snorkel. Just do it.,1

"We only use the clock for time, not as an alarm. The letters are large and easy to read from across the room. However, even the dim setting is pretty bright.

"I like the fact that it's glass but do not like the fact that this doesn't adhere to the glass surface. There is a gap (air space) between the glass and the phone screen glass. Not ideal. Yes I can turn up the sensitivity but i often find my typing way off. Very annoying. Would NOT buy this again. Then again, I'm no fan of the edge design either, it sucks too.",0

"Don‚Äôt know why but the costume was very, very wrinkled (plastic). Wondering if it was returned and not properly repackaged. The fan was not powerful enough as to keep the head all up and stretch the wrinkles. It did not look good when I tested it... even less for the price. Sending it back. Runs large. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and I think it would be too hard for me to wear it ... maybe it works well for a taller person or a big guy. Also, the tutu is nothing like the picture.",0

"In addition to not helping me curb my appetite and not keeping me in ketosis, I can't stand the texture of this! It doesn't mix well at all. I already have a favorite keto base, but I was looking to try something different. I spent a few hours researching different types of keto bases and reading reviews before making my purchase. This product seemed to have great reviews, however I was incredibly disappointed with the results. I have been using this 2-3 times per day and somehow my ketone levels have dropped. With my other keto base I was able to drink it in the morning and fast until the afternoon. When I drink this in the morning, I'm hungry by 10am.",0

I got these as a gift. I've always used Cuisinart Black Teflon for many years but I have to say that this set is absolutely fabulous! I've cooked with them a few times already and cleanup is so easy.

Much faster acting and equally stain and debris removing as other brands. This one is cheaper and superior.,1
Great on carpet. Just okay on hard floors. Bad at little bits of paper. I love it for my girls to vacuum the carpet. The handle height is adjustable for them to use and they find it so fun. Praise God!,1

"I love these socks to wander around the house in. They are too thick to wear inside shoes comfortable (to me) but they are super soft and they keep soft through many washings. My only worry is they tend to bunch up at the top and I find strings I have to cut off after almost every wash. I'm really afraid one day I'll go to put them on and they'll have lost their shape around the top. Until then, though, they are fantastic!",1
Too firm. The first couple of nights were OK but then I started to notice frequent headaches. The design is unique and ambitious but I guess I just need a softer pillow.,0

"I'll end up keeping it because it was under twenty on a warehouse deal but I would feel completely ripped off if I paid full price. The head is much smaller than it appears in the pictures and more important, the light is not very bright. It seems more like a desk lamp head on a floor lamp body. The controls are annoying and temperamental. I'm going to end up using it in the garage as an overhead adjustable work lamp, and I suppose it might have made a decent reading light, but otherwise I think people will be disappointed, especially at the current $55 price.",0

"I like the color. It suits my wedding Invitation theme. I gave it 4 stars because it's thin. Still workable though, I think the advantage with this kind of envelope is that you can bulk it up with invitations and rsvp's. Compared to a really thick but snuggly fitted envelope",1
These are beautiful glasses. We ordered them specifically to drink gin drinks. They are the perfect size and look really classy. We used them a couple of times and hand washed them each time. The third time I hand washed them and the bowl part of one of them totally shattered in my hand while I was drying it. I was really careful with them but still this happened. Such a shame. Really liked them until that happened. I was going to order more but I'm nervous the same thing will happen again.,0
It's ok. Material quality is great. Seems though that it's not a wide enough material used. My wife is small. 5 foot 3 and about 135 pounds. This barely goes around her. Seems they should add about 3-5 inches of material and it would be perfect. She needs an extra clip on bottom half to avoid any free shows.,0
"Muy buena calidad. Son de silicona bastante resistente y muy flexible.

It squeaks.... loud and a lot! From the first time I used it!

"This is the story of a police night patrol featuring two (partners) officers. It is realistic and interesting -- depicts what officers do most of the time, and this makes it different. The novel is not a thriller nor a mystery, per se, more the routine of a night patrol. There is a human element as the reader sees into the lives and minds of the featured officers. As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series. Reviewed by the author of The Children's Story, About Good and Evil.",1

"Really pleased with the curtains, and the price is better than any local store! The material is silky and soft without being shiny. There is a white liner on the back helping to block light and heat. I bought 2 sets and they are more than enough to cover 12 feet of windows.",1
I loved the product! It‚Äôs natural and it took away all the itchy redness my granddaughter had! Poor thing would wake herself up itching. Now she sleeps well and feel better:),1
"Let me first explain why I chose this model over others. I don't like the vent clips - I do not think prolonged exposure to hot or cold direct forced air is good for the phone. Dash mounts (even the magnetic ones) require putting adhesive on your dash - no thank you. Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road. My best bet is in the middle, where it is slightly harder to reach, but at least if I'm using GPS it's easier to view than it is sitting in my cupholder or lap.",0

"Hay algo que me sorprende que no haya comentado nadie y que considero un fallo muy grave de estas luces. No se apagan al detectar luz artificial. No solo eso, sino que se encienden al detectar la luz.

"Terrible. Didn‚Äôt hold air from the jump. Waited a few days and it still wouldn‚Äôt even hold all the air for more than 10 minutes.

"I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.",1

"Stop using Amazon Delivery Drivers, they are incompetent and continually damage packages",0
"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",0

"We bought one of these. Returned it, bought another. Stupid mistake. I don‚Äôt know if we had bad batteries but we ordered two of these. They last a couple of hours and die.

It is a great product. It looks awesome with the cigars in it and more importantly it keeps humility great.,1
"It fits decent. It did not seem to fit to great at first but now that it is broken in -- it is good to go. My problem with the case could have been operator error.

Love the way it turned out. Good quality,1
"For approx. $160 you can't go wrong. Only complaint I would have is that I wish there was an extra loop on the rubber wrist band to hold the free end of the band once buckled in place. Other than that, very sharp looking watch. Beefy, great luminescence at night once you've lit it up with a flash light. Masculine look and feel. Plus the solar power (Eco-drive) for it means never replacing a battery. Keeps time perfectly. Have not had to adjust it a single time - no seconds gain/loss month to month.",1
Very elegant. Item was just as described.,1
Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!,0

Great shoes for doing chores at the barn BUT they could be a little wider. I do find they hurt my baby toes but I have plenty of room in the length. I bought the next bigger size hoping they wouldn't hurt my feet.,1
Pretty good for cheap hydrometers. One was way off but I suppose that's not too bad.,1
Todo perfecto y r√°pido,1
Its already out poor quality,0
I bought this labeler because a different brand that I had would not print labels that stuck to cables very well. This one seems to stick a little bit better but it wastes a lot of label material as others have pointed out. You can set the length of the label but it always prints out much much more than needed so you have to have scissors ready every time to cut off excess.,0
"So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There‚Äôs a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You‚Äôd need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I‚Äôll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.",0

"Its a bit larger than I was expecting. My cat cannot figure it out and is starving himself instead of taking the time to dig into every crevice of the maze to get his food! And this cat of mine is obsessed with eating, so the fact that he wont take the time to figure out how to eat out of this is quite shocking. Is my cat just that dumb? Or Lazy? Or spoiled?",0
Bonita edici√≥n y encuadernaci√≥n.,1
This product is convenient to use and looks very beautiful. The special humanization of the design saved me a lot of time.,1
I purchased this item in order to cut back on the usage of plastic bottles. Perhaps not the best water filter on the market but I think it does a great job and I see no major difference between bottled water and water from this product.,1
While the nail polish was cute it just didn‚Äôt stay on my daughters nails and wasn‚Äôt very dark in color. It was like paining a clear coat with glitter.,0
The product was packaged poorly (thrown in a plastic bag-not boxed). Many pieces were broken.,0
"Lleg√≥ muy r√°pido. Estanca perfectamente, no sale ni una gota. Hubiese estado bien un poco m√°s grande para mayor capacidad de l√≠quido. La rejilla no hace muy muy bien su cometido por eso le doy 4 estrellas. El dep√≥sito es ideal para transportar los polvos.",1
will use them on hard seat church pews,1
I got my package today and it was used it came with dog hair all over it! I am really mad because my house is allergic to dogs!,0
Pros: Bags are very full! Seems like they are made to last Has built in buckle to latch both bags together Con: rear bag doesnt hold the butt of the gun upright enough because its a shallow V shape instead of deep U Front bag is so wide doesnt help hold gun up just helps it be level All in all cant complain cuz i dont see any better alternatives at this pricepoint,1

I opened my package to discover it had opened and spilled everywhere! I went to return the item as defective and found out it isn‚Äôt returnable. Now I have 3 lbs of gum balls I have to throw out because I have no idea on how sanitary the boxes are and where they have been.,0
I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don‚Äôt slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn‚Äôt have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn‚Äôt caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while.,1
Sturdy built well it‚Äôll get the job done and you can‚Äôt beat the price was a great stocking stuffer,1
I purchased the item about 2 months ago. The fist few weeks the items was great then the watch started to freeze. I would have a blank screen at times the watch does the basic. There are some glitches,0

Esta bien. Justo en su tama√±o y para el uso que se le da. Es c√≥modo. Con una correa estar√≠a genial.,1
I enjoy all the fragrances and the assortment is great. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that nowhere does it tell me if they are natural or synthetic.,1
"This series has super wide-angle lens, macro lens, fisheye lens, zoom lens, whether it is a wide panorama in the tour, or shooting tiny animals without problems. There is also a protective box that can be hand-held, and it is light and easy to go to photography at any time.",1
"I ordered this for my husband, we have been having trouble conceiving and decided this would be a nice place to begin checking into our fertility. We are anxious to begin and get the results, he does the test 100% direction by direction and the test cake back inconclusive. Nothing read up on the test window. After all of that hassle and paying for the product, it didnt even work. Were both incredibly disappointed.",0
I purchased these to use with my Instant Pot and they work well.,1
This works very well. Love that the cord is chew resistant and that you can set the temperature. I use this under our Golden Retriever's bed. She just had a litter of 8 puppies and this pad allows her to leave them without us worrying about them getting cold. 4 stars because I thought it would be bigger. Please note it isn't the size for a Golden Retriever.,1

"This cheap hamper might be okay for temporary use. ""Dorm use"" is a stretch and I definitely don't recommend it for a kids' room. The one we bought has been in use for exactly one year. You can see from the pictures that it is now falling apart. The fabric mesh has several small rips and is coming away from the seem in places. Two of the thin metal bands that hold the structure of this hamper have come loose. One of them is a loop and the other has a sharp terminal! The one that is a loop used to be very small. It stuck out just a little. Because the band is so thin in profile, it was invisible against the dark blue hamper full of dark clothes. It caught my toe as I walked by and ouch! It sawed between my toes as it pulled out from the fabric. I spilled my morning coffee all over the bathroom. We probably should have replaced this hamper months ago but I was being stubborn. Don't be like me. Spend a little more and buy a real hamper. If you need to get one of these for temporary use, throw it away when it starts to break up. A kid or pet could probably get hurt on this thing.",0
Looks exactly like pic and great for a gamers room,1

"The outdoor temperature quit working about 5 months ago. I have had less than a year. I cannot get assistance beyond them explaining to remove/replace batteries, and the sensor replacement is essentially as much as the item. My grandfather is so sad, he was truly enjoying it while it was functioning.",0
Great pop socket! I ordered several and this is definitely made the best! I‚Äôm returning the other brands! It was very sticky and definitely lasts! I‚Äôm going to order another in the diamond metallic I like it so much! Oh...this says it‚Äôs grey but it‚Äôs so light grey it matches my white silver phone perfect!,1

"The cup look and feels is sexy and slick. Only problem is the bad sipping design. If you're storing really hot tea/coffee, sipping through it can cause your lips to burn easily. I ended up having to open the lid each time I have need a drink.",0
This item arrived with several cracks from the packaging. I left on the dashboard of my car and it melted. Worst thing I ever saw.,0

"I have a pair of these gloves from over 10 years ago. That pair is great, you can take a razor sharp knife and run in along the palm and nothing, no cuts, to tears.. Nothing. The new ones are garbage. I took the same knife and lightly ran it across the palm and it cut all the way through the glove. You can tell they are no longer made the same. Save your money and if you bought these DO NOT TRUST them. they offer NO cut resistance at all.",0

"Really good book, but there is some minor editing issues and I'm not sure if it is because I read with black background and white text. But the text going from gray to white to sometimes blue kinda throws me off. Still a good book and can't wait for the next one",1
"Loved these initially, bright, worked as advertised. But one of the two I bought has already gone out. Have only been using it for 2 months and it's already dead. UPDATE: The company responded immediately when they saw my review and send me a replacement bulb. So great customer service!",1
"I ordered this product and they charged shipping that was just as much as the product itself!!! Then try and find someone to contact, yeah right. Got screwed again.",0
Some of mine were dried out when I opened.Some of the colors were very light and didn't show up well.The darker colors worked the best. For the price it was a great range and selection of colors.,0

"Worked as advertised, dash surface any type or angle. Very satisfied.",1
"Firstly, I'm not your average joe when it comes to a car wash. This is the best product I have ever used on my Corvette. I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time. You will wish you can thank me. This is the perfect stuff to keep your car looking its vest you wont even want to drive it! Thanks Car Guys, you guys are something else. This product is really a 10/5 stars",1
"So I‚Äôve had this mount for about 3 months and I absolutely hate it. The housing is good but the mount arm is poor quality. It does not stay where I need it to so I‚Äôve had to tape it in place, which you can imagine is barely effective for an outdoor mount. I would not recommend purchasing this. There has to be a better product than this one.",0

"Producto m√°s peque√±o de lo que esperaba Un cobaya adulto no cabe bien. Se queda ""encajado"". Para roedores m√°s peque√±os, fenomenal.",0
"These are great if you have a small waist, narrow hips. They last much longer than the other briefs that Hanes makes.",1
"Works great, fits perfectly. Cable seems very durable.",1
"This was the go-to stuff for our ancestors. . Studies show it to be very nearly as effective as antibiotic ointments still. Lubricates, protects, weather resists, etc. all sorts of stuff. Do a web search and you'll go back to it and save money too.",1
This will not help you with finding anything at all. It doesn‚Äôt offer any true guidance. Just some basic questions and you write your response. It‚Äôs just a journal nothing more. Very disappointed. Instead of wasting your money on this I would recommend The path made clear by Oprah is way more helpful. Or just get yourself a notebook and write your daily thoughts down and reflect once a week. That‚Äôs it. Save your money.,0
Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading more of the Authors works,1
"Por fin alguien explica como usar las escalas, no solo muestra patrones de las escalas si no, que te ense√±a c√≥mo usarlas. Muy buen libro",1
"Soy higienista dental y esta marca de cepillos me parece muy buena. En concreto este producto lo he regalado en varias ocasiones por su dise√±o tan bonito. Lo aconsejo para gente con pr√≥tesis fijas y/o removibles, acompa√±ado mejor del irrigador. Es muy gracioso usar una aplicaci√≥n para un cepillo de dientes, pero de verdad que ense√±a a lavarte los dientes. Muy recomendable",1
I just got it today and I put some new battery in it and it‚Äôs not turning on at all.,0
"Easy to swallow, with no bad taste. Love the pick me up that I get from these",1
Perfect fit and lightweight,1
I should have read the description better,1
"This book started off pretty slow. But it soon got better. After the first few chapters I couldn't put it down. What a wonderful read. I love psychological thrillers, and this book was certainly a good one.",1
"No puedo valorar, porque el paquete lo perdieron, lo dijeron que lo dejaron en el buz√≥n los de correos y no estaba",0
This product is AWESOMENESS,1
This item simply didn't work well. The grinder is a joke. I wasted $30. Worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Wish I could return it.,0
Good product and have reordered several times. My vet recommended this for my dog as we were having to get her glands expressed every 1 1/2 weeks. When I first started using this that time frame expanded to 1 1/2 months. I was so excited to find something to help. After using for nearly a year that time frame has shorted to about once every month. Still much better than every 10 days. I will continue to order this product. Much better option over risky surgery.,1
This book was really well written . . . I liked this book a lot . . . . .,1
Fun to choose the ring you want but any power outage resets to original and have to go through to find yours again. Don‚Äôt put it behind anything or it won‚Äôt work. Bummer as we have a century old home with lots of walls & turns,1
These hide-a-lines are absolute garbage. The plastic is cheap it flakes off as you attempt to attach them together. The screws strip out every time you attempt to use them. This product made a rough job even harder. I wish I had time to return them but I have to continue using them...,0
Great for a studio that is in its beginner stages!,1
"This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",1
The tablet had a slow reaction time. I would touch the screen and the page or item would take at least 2 to 3 seconds to work.,0
Had Western Digital in all my builds and they've been great. Decided to try the Fire Cuda and it failed two weeks in and I lost so much data. Never again!!,0
These markers are either fake or used. Very disappointed with this product.,0
"I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!",0
"Worst charger ever. I have had it barely one month and the metal part that goes in your phone broke off inside my phone when I went to un-charge, I had to use pliers to rip it out. Do not buy!",0
"My 5 year old granddaughter wears a size 10 shoe and these are too large on her feet. They are so stiff and uncomfortable that she won't even try to wear them. She does like how they light up, but since she won't put them on her feet, that feature is useless.",0
Not reliable and did not chop well. Came apart with second use. Pampered Chef is my all-time favorite with Zyliss coming in second.,0
"Una de las bolsas tiene fuga... solo he usando unos d√≠as, ya no puedo usarla.",0
The screen protector moves around and doesn't stick so it pops off or slides around,0
These cords do not fit Android phones and are too fat for Apple. Basically the are useless. Product cost 10 bucks and the return fee is 6 bucks. Not worth the trouble of returning. Just don't buy.,0
"Key did not work, just kept spinning in cuffs",0
Still haven‚Äôt received refund.. didn‚Äôt fit my 7/8 bar properly flew off on highway,0
"I bought this for my son, It is a nice case but did not protect it at all. He dropped it from a short distance and the phone shattered.",0

Omg this book was absolutely amazing. This book was a page turner that I just couldn't stop reading until the end. I had absolutely loved reading this book. I would highly recommended this book.,1
"It really does work. I moved into an apartment, before Bengal I sprayed with another spray. I‚Äôve seen a couple of roaches, exterminator came around & exterminated the whole building, saw a couple more. I ordered & sprayed Bengal & I have not seen any. It really do work.",1
I liked the color but the product don't stay latched or closed after putting any cards in the slots,0
"I will Never buy ARRIS again! I got screwed. I was lucky to get 30 mbps download speed in the same room on wifi. Changed to Netgear and bounced up to over 100 Mbps in the same room and over 60 Mbps on the other end of the house with 4 walls blocking my laptop. Don't waste your money. Comcast even Stated that they no longer use them due to need for upgrades and problems according to Comcast technician, who came to house because we could not figure out why my computer was having so many problems down loading pages and streaming video. It took over a month to figure out so I have to eat the cost.",0
"Es el segundo que compro de la marca, muy buena terminaci√≥n. Llego cuando tocaba as√≠ que todo correcto. Recomendar√≠a la marca",1
I love how the waist doesn't have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.,1
It is so very thin and see through. Material is cheap and my finger poked right though it. Very disappointed. Won't buy again.,0
"I really loved this backpack; however, after only 3 uses the bag started to leak where the ""straw"" connects to the bladder. No matter how I clicked it in it would still leak and not a slow leak either.",0
Well made and simple pans.,1
Bought 42mm for my series 3 .It looks good and exactly in the given picture however the strap loosens up very often .Not comfortable after you wear it for more than 15 minutes.The only good thing is that it comes from the protector which is quite useful to avoid any scratches .Overall disappointed with this strap.Have taken it off and gone back to the original sports strap from Apple.,0
"This IS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED. The photo originally had this entire package including the Wii, remotes, Wii fit, Wii balance board, Wii sports package and Super Mario Bros. I had my husband look at all 8 pictures closely because I wanted to make sure I was buying what was advertised. I placed my order and the picture that showed up in my email was NOTHING like what was advertised. This is the SECOND TIME this has happened!! I passed on other seemingly good offers and chose a slightly higher priced package because it had Amazon Prime next to the price... obviously this means nothing! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!",0
Imagery is beautiful. Card stock isn‚Äôt the best. Peels quite easily.,1
"Use it to hold my ipad on counter when cooking, closing it shuts off the unit, gives good protection to unit (know its coffee proof :))",1
"This karaoke microphone is awesome. Its design is cool. When I connected it to my phone first time, it‚Äôs easy and quick to connect. The sounds is very good. I love to sing a song with this microphone. It let my voice better than before.",1
It didn't even faze the dogs at all the just walked into it like it wasn't even there!!! Waste of my money,0
They still have yet to arrive. Super disappointed because I needed for a project.,0
very lightweight and easy to spill litter when cleaning. you have to keep a good grip on it.,0
Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out.,0
"Hi Seller, I have not received my stuff. Thanks",0
"Very unfortunate that I have to 1 star this screen protector, but the adhesive is terrible. Very good value, but in 15 days I've had to use both that came with as they keep falling off. There are spots in the adhesive that are not coated and allow dust to get under the screen as well.",0
Thisnis a mirrored window cling. It doesnt tell you this but the cling side is the clear side and the outer side is the mirrored side. This will only give you the mirrored effect to the outside if you place on the outside if your window exposed to the elements which defeats the entire purpose. A waste of my time...,0
"Adhesive stickers are completely defective. Mirrors fell off on their own with enough time, and shattered.",0
This glass is all scratched and I will have to replace it. I have purchased this brand several times for other phone models. I have the same brand on my v30+ and it is excellent This glass for the Moto g7 is not good.,0
Ten√≠a problemas con el Jack de mi PC y con este micr√≥fono que va por USB me he quitado esos problemas.,1
"Me gustan todos los t√≥nicos de Lancaster y este tambi√©n. Limpia y huele bien, y dura mucho por tener 400 ml. Lo recomiendo.",1
"This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5"" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.",1
Son estupendas. Las tenemos en la habitaci√≥n del ni√±o y quitan la luz de dia y protegen algo del frio de noche.,1
Have not used at night yet,1
Worked well on one door but not the other.,1
"I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the binding. I ended up ordering a different agenda. Could be for some, but I‚Äôm not one.",0
"2 meses, rompi√≥ la uni√≥n de las 2 cuerdas",0
"I am very unhappy with the helmet I received, it came out of the box warped (the shape of the helmet was bent like it had been squished.) The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy.",0
"Was sent without the straw lid so very disappointed with that. Otherwise, a great bottle.",0
"I'm not sure why, but the first two times I used these they adhered fine and every other pair has been too slippery to really stay where they belong. I would have rated them higher if they all stayed in place like the first two pairs did. I always have limited expectations for products that are basically glorified moisturizing, so while I wouldn't say these do anything dramatic, they are at least pleasant to use - when they are not slipping.",0
These leggings run small. I would recommend ordering at least 1 size larger than your normal size. They are very well made. An FYI the white legging is transparent.,0
"So far my daughter loves it. She uses it for school backpack. As far as durable, we just got it, so we will have to see.",1
"I received a gift of a himalayan salt lamp last year and have been enjoying its benefits so I decided to buy more to put around the house. I initially bought 2 from this seller due to high ratings and rave reviews. The first 2 arrived and they were beautiful, just the perfect brightness and glow, they were both very different shapes and glow and I loved the fact that it is dimmable, perfect when you want it to be not too bright when sleeping. I ordered another 2 the next day but this time one of them came a bit short of the quality I was expecting. I am aware no 2 lamps are alike and there will be irregularities in the form but this one had gray dark streaks that looked like mold around it and the light was concentrated only on the base of the lamp and the top third half just looked like a pink salt block, I am returning one of them. I guess 3 out of 4 is not bad, hence the 4 stars. Update: As soon as my review posted on Amazon Levoit contacted me directly, refunded my money and told me I didn‚Äôt need to go through the hassle of sending the defective salt lamp, truly impressive customer service. Due to this, I have bought 4 more lamps to give as gifts and all of those arrived in perfect condition and are all excellent lamps.",1
Wasn‚Äôt happy how it bent my hats & also left a line on the bill from the plastic,0
"Por lo que se ve en la foto es grande y largo, yo ped√≠ una S y no me lo puedo poner, enorme es la palabra adecuada.",0
This paper I believe is a replacement for a glossy cannon paper I used to buy. This paper isn't as heavy as the previous edition and won't stay straight in my Canon pro-100 printer.,0
"It keeps things cold very well. My issue is with the top, it gets dirty between the two layers of the slide drinking slide and there is no way to clean it. I‚Äôm looking for a leakproof top that You can wash. Mine looks pretty mildewed after 6 weeks. Cloudy and trapped dirt is in there",1
"Me gusta el reloj y parece que funciona bien, aunque todav√≠a no lo he usado mucho.",1
"When I was putting on the passenger side cover, it ran in two places like nylons. I contacted the seller and they said they would ship another.. so I thought ok. I tries putting on the covers and they did not fit properly, so I packed the merchandise back up. I never did receive the other cover anyways. I went ahead and refunded the product. I lost $15, not including taxes. Very disappointed in this seller. I would never buy from this company again. Live and learn.",0
Just what I needed. Finding these was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that was 'just right'.,1
"My husband is picky about his underwear, but he loves these! They run a little small. My hubby wears M, but I bought these in L. And they fit him perfect. He says the best thing about them (besides comfort, obviously) is the solid piece in the front. There‚Äôs no flap. I have always had to hand-sew the flaps closed on all his other underwear. But, not anymore. I love Starter!",1
"I wasn‚Äôt impressed with the size of the container for the price, until I tried it! I‚Äôm a Postal worker, and my fingertips and cuticles were always getting cuts in them due to all the paper I touch drying my hands out. I started using this two weeks ago and they are now soft and healed over! I‚Äôm impressed!",1
"Ummm.....there is no ink in the cartridges. I'm thinking someone returned this and Amazon regifted it to me. Thanks,",0
"I ordered these for my husband, to help with knee pain, while working out. They seem to really help provide support that he did not have prior. My only issue was the tend to slide down, so they had to be readjusted just a couple times. Comfortable material, though.",1
"What can I say? They do the job and my boss asked me to throw out the plastic stirrers which he said would impact on our health due to chemicals in the plastic that would be released. Oy. What next? I personally use a metal spoon to stir. I'm sure someone will find something wrong with that as well! However, the stirrers serve their purpose and my boss is happy. That makes me happy!!!",1
I always order a larger size because it shrinks like crazy.,1
I love this watch band. Bought it for the colors but love the comfort and adjustability. Pleasantly surprised but this. would absolutely purchase again!,1
"Como todas las fundas que he tenido de esta marca, super contento. Ajuste perfecto al terminal, buena protecci√≥n ante caidas fortuitas. Si sale como la del galaxy S7 comprada hace m√°s de un a√±o, el color transparente degrada con el paso del tiempo, se vuelve de un color ocre.",1
"This pillow seemed promising for my beck pain based on the 5 star reviews; however, it was not firm enough for me. After requiring a cervical fusion many years ago my neck needs firm support. If this is you, I would not recommend this pillow.",0
"Todo perfecto. Lleno de utilidades, trae un trapito para su limpieza, color verde dorado, y varios capuchones de recambio para la punta t√°ctil",1
primero compre uno y me enviaron dos.pague los dos por supuesto lo deje en un punto de recogida y no pasaron a por el y para colmo de mis males no funcionan bien,0
Right earbud has given our after less than 6 months of use. Do not buy.,0
"Es muy bonito y como tel√©fono funciona muy bien. Nos ha costado un poco conectar el m√≥vil al tel√©fono y tuvimos q recurrir a la ayuda del proveedor. Pero la verdad es q con su ayuda muy bien. La ni√±a est√° encantada. Por sacarle un pero, el GPS tiene desviaci√≥n importante.",1
"I will definitely be reading more of this author. I enjoyed the plot, the character development and the introduction of the secondary characters. I look forward to the next in the series.",1
"When I got these, one of them was not working. The ready lasted about a month before giving out.",0
"I got this charging cable three months ago in September and it doesn't work anymore. It worked fine when I first got it, but now when I plug it in my phone tells me that the connection is incomplete. For the first few days after this started popping up, my phone would still charge overnight as long as I didn't use it. But now, it won't charge it at all.",0
Replacement got missing original volume. Came in perfect condition.,1
Not flashy at all. One little spot of blue. I feel really ripped off. Now i find out i CANNOT return it!!! I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!,0
Not the correct bulbs would not work in conjunction with factory fog lights,0
"Really, really thin.",0
Easy install and feel taught and sturdy.,1
Didn‚Äôt work for me. Second brand I‚Äôve tried.,0
Gave as a gift and the person loved it. Plus they had to wear a full leg brace and didn't want to put on socks so this worked perfectly.,1
Very tight around ankles. Have ordered them before and they were fine...but this batch is hard for me to wear..,0
This bandage worked out perfectly for our needs it was used to cover a dog bite injury and stayed in place with lots of ointment on wound.,1
"Love these lights. Lots of fun. We wore them when we went wine tasting before Christmas, and got raves. All I heard all day was, where did you get them? The only complaint is some of the bulbs were messed up. Not clear. Looked like glue was all over them.",1
Fit perfectly into my coach tote! Makes the order very organized and easy to find items. I love it and will buy it in diff colors for other handbags!,1
Some of these taste like rocks and gravel. If you like that flavor go ahead. Pineapple is tolerable.,0
These are powerful but very brittle. Half of them broke/cracked apart immediately.,0
I will never order from Amazon again. I never received my package. Thia is not the only first time they lie! Their drivers need to be more honest,0
I never write reviews but I just had to in this case. I bought this over a month ago for a birthday gift. Friend opened it yesterday and it appears that the bottle was damaged or defective because 1/3 of the perfume leaked out and stained all the tissue paper and carton. Very embarrassed to give such a gift.,0
Just get a days worth. Expected more,0
Amazing lasted months,1
"iF YOU ARE DIABETIC OR SENSITIVE TO SUGAR, LEAVE THIS ALONE. They have loaded this with so much sugar to hide the taste you will go into a coma with one gulp. LOL! But it is pretty bad.",0
"This game exceeded all of my very high expectations for it. I have only played the single player, but have over 80 hours in it with many more things I want to do and see. The story is outstanding and the game world has so much free space, variety, and a wild feeling to it.",1
Good to expand reach,1
"Order hose for home use, installed hose on my hose reel. 3.5 months later hose has a leak close to end attached to hose reel. While hose did not kink it was hard to move and heavy. Hose has a 12 year warranty. Tried to contact company but only international numbers available, page ask for email. Reluctant to send email to unknown company with only overseas address. I do not recommend using this brand of hose. Contacted by Worth Garden Sept. 6, 2018 with emails stating replacement hose would be sent. No word emailed Sept. 13, 2018 about no replacement Hose, answered they were working on it. Today Sept. 28, 2018 still no replacement Hose or email. Appears Hose is as good as Warranty. Would not recommend buying from Worth Garden.",0
"No es de buena calidad, va muy lento y no lo lee en algunos reproductores usb",0
Very artificial tasting,0
Handle is crooked and overall super poor quality.,0
"Good soap, specially for the price. Nothing too premium but great for maintenance washes with some wax in it.",1
Great and handy chair,1
Other than being totally dented on one side it seemed ok.,0
"My 3 month old peed alllll over it, and it all stayed on the pad. It's on the small side. So I say it's great for new babies, and can handle everything little babies throw at it. I will likely upgrade to larger pads in the next few months.",1
Really nice covers. Quality excellent. !!,1
"My 97 year-old Dad could not use any phone but this one. His vision does not allow him to see the numbers on the buttons, so my daughter made up a large print chart with names that correspond to the buttons. It was easy to program and set up. It is so easy for him to lift the receiver and press one button to reach me. The only problem is that others, such as the aides at his assisted living facility, do not understand how to use it when it is on one-button program mode. I would have liked the amplified audio to be even louder, but that is mostly a problem because my father won't wear his hearing aids. This really helped solve a big problem for us, and I would buy it again, for sure.",1
I have purchased Orgain products for years. I started out drinking the smooth chocolate and then switched to the vegan chocolate once that was available. I drank 1 to 2 every day. The last products I received tasted horrible. I looked at the ingredients and noticed Orgain changed the formulation. It is absolutely disgusting. Orgain has lost a long time customer.,0
I‚Äôve used the eye mask twice so far. No issues with them staying in place. I‚Äôve already started to notice a difference in my eyes.,1
Like that has easy close lid over dispenser hole to keep picks clean. Easy to dispense one at a time.,1
Did not fit as advertised.,0
"Inc√≥modo, demasiado duro, no lo volver√≠a a comprar",0
"As many other people state here, once motion is detected it takes forever for it to start recording video. I had a mailman come, rattle around in my mailbox for a good minute, then walk away. The arlo only recorded the back of his head as he moved away. Definitely regret purchasing this.",0
"I received the product on time but it was a reconditioned one. I ordered a new one. The cord was just wrapped around the unit, it was missing the back to the remote and the corner was chipped.",0
They are there for emergency. I test weekly and all is well,1
"Those are at least 30% smaller than standard ear backs of the same type. I suspect, too small for an average person to be able to hold them between your fingers comfortably.",0
"Dude this is a really good flag and it's hanging on my wall, this is totally 5 stars, the only minor thing is instead of the seam on the black being a black seam it was yellow but other than that yee yee",1
The package only had 1 rectangular pan and 1 cupcake pan. Missing 2 rectangular pans.,0
Works great and very easy to install.,1
"Tras varias aspiradoras escoba de marca que acaban durando lo justo me decid√≠ por esta para probar y de momento contento. La uso a diario porque tengo perro que suelta mucho pelo y va bien. No tiene mucha potencia pero es suficiente. La bater√≠a dura bastante y es muy silenciosa y ligera. Edito: en apenas 2 meses el rodillo del cepillo no gira, por lo que no aspira nada bien, y una pieza de pl√°stico que lleva un muelle se ha partido sin m√°s (es m√°s fuerte el muelle que el pl√°stico).",0
Goes with many things. Good quality - I love it,1
"Ayer coloque la bateria en mi Compex despues de cargarlo 10h. Hasta ahi sin problemas. Pero me qued√≥ encendido con un error, por el que no se me apaga el aparato, con lo que para que funcione tengo que andar sacando y metiendo la bateria. Me da miedo que se me estropee el aparato ya que en una tienda donde venden las baterias originales me han advertido de que eso puede pasar. Entiendo que me ha salido caro lo barato ya que he perdido el dinero de la bateria, porque que me da miedo usarla y dejarla encendida con el error de aviso al servicio tecnico.",0

"I was very excited and optimistic about this product! When first trying it, it was very comfortable but I wished it could be a little taller. I used it for a couple months at work and the seat started the slowly lower while sitting. I contacted the manufacturer directly and the customer was great. They sent me a replacement part and I was satisfied. Until about 2 months later and it is having the same problem. Contacted them again, they sent another replacement part but this one for some reason or another won‚Äôt raise as high as the others had. When contacted again, the customer service rep let me know that it could take a month to get a new part shipped from overseas. I like this product but am disappointed with the quality.",0
I purchased these coffee mugs because of the Swell reputation. The length of time that it keeps a product cold or hot is spot on from the advertisement. The one thing I do not like about either of these coffee travelers that I purchased is the drink spout. You flip it up to drink out of it but the part that you flip up is moist from either cold or hot drink whatever is in it. That part is in the way of your drinking and usually will get your face nose or whatever is near it wet. I have to constantly dry that flip part off before I drink my beverage. That‚Äôs why I gave it four stars.,1
"I wanted to love this suit!! The pattern is adorable! I ordered an XL (I‚Äôm usually a 10-12, between medium and large in pants and tops) so I thought it would be plenty big enough. It barely covered my behind and left me with lots of side boob. After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me! The suit I got was the same as the first picture in description. Cute print and nice fabric, but def not for me",0
"Perfecta en todas sus funciones. Calidad y velocidad. Posibilidad de scaneo autom√°tico a doble cara y copiado a doble cara en varias orientaciones diferentes. Si que es cierto que para alguna de las funciones es necesario tener conocimientos inform√°ticos y de redes pero no es para nada necesario en las funciones habituales como, scanear/copiar o impresi√≥n y scanear desde ordenador o USB. Configurar tu correo para poder enviar documentos directamente desde el scaner a una cuenta de correo tiene algo m√°s de dificultad que la configuraci√≥n en un m√≥vil pero pr√°cticamente si ves como se ha configurado en tu m√≥vil podr√°s hacerlo en la impresora aunque dependiendo de que cuenta sea no he sido capaz ( Outlook). Con cuentas de gmail es posible sin problemas. Como consejo no configures con la misma cuenta a la que quieres enviarte los documentos es posible que no funcione.",1

These puffs come in their own little container making it easy to store. I use it to apply cc cream and it does a good job. It takes a bit to clean them and I find I need to use some rubbing alcohol to get it real clean.,1
I can use my phone in bed while charging it!! The original Apple cable wasn't long enough so I had to lean over to the night stand to use my phone. This cable is PERFECT!! Long enough to use it anywhere is bed. I love it!!,1

Base got way too hot. Worried about a fire hazard. My daughter really wanted a lava lamp but I didn‚Äôt think it was safe enough to have something that got so hot in her room.,0
Bonita pero peque√±a. Cosa es de viaje,1
"There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made. The plastic will probably not last with much use either. The material and velcro were robust, but the quick release velcro was not intuitive to setup. I returned this.",0
"Wasn‚Äôt what I needed , quality poor",0
Ordered 5 or 6 weeks ago. Never received.,0

This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I‚Äôm going to have to hem the bottom because it‚Äôs long. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it‚Äôs great for the price!,1
"Lo tengo dos semanas y por el momento me esta dando muy buen resultado se ha adaptado bien al robot y funciona perfectamente, algunos problemillas con el env√≠o pero todo solucionado satisfactoriamente",1

"Liars. This does not work with any other smart devices without their respective hubs. I had to buy the Hue Hub in order to get the Harmony hub to work with my Hue lights. Works acceptably as a remote. Does do its prime function of setting the 7 devices I have in my entertainment system for each type of media. It does set the TV sleep timer though when viewing via Apple TV so I have to turn the TV back on an hour into streaming. Stilling working on trying to find the software setting to fix this. I use my iPhone as the remote for the Harmony so I have to look at the display in order to get the correct ‚Äúbutton‚Äù so I have gone back to using the cable remote to control the cable as I can do so by feel instead of by sight. Occasionally, the app loses volume control via the iPhone physical volume controls, but leaving and returning to the app corrects the issue.",0
"Very good spatula, it gets the job done. There is/was a slight wobble in handle, so the tolerance in the connection of the wooden handle to the metal body could stand to be tightened. Other than that, fantastic spatula.",1

"The proportions of the pants did not fit my body. The pants were snug in the legs (as desired), but it was way too big in the waist. I am 5'3, 120 lbs and I ordered an xs. I fear the xxs would be too tight in the legs. I am returning this item.",0

"Decent, but it does have a cheap feel to it. You can tell the plastic is really thin and the power/charging light shines through the case a little.",1
"These may be dishwasher safe, but I don't recommend putting them in there: They rust. Also, they are the least user-friendly scissors I've ever owned. Operating them, even when cutting something as easy as wrapping paper, is a hand workout in itself. Just say ""no"" to these.",0
Just went to put on another one....bubbles everywhere and won‚Äôt come out. I‚Äôd continue shopping around before purchasing here,0
"Case is nice, it's more hard case than that rubbery feel some cases have and I like that. Only downside is the brand name on the case, I got a clear case to show the phone. I'd prefer it not to be there but it's not a huge deal.",1
Too bad you can‚Äôt give them zero stars. All of them don‚Äôt work anymore and I have only used each one about 4 times. They are horrible and break fast. Do not buy.,0
"In theory these should work well, however, I could not get these to stay in place once they‚Äôve been used a couple of times. Once they start falling off, they are useless and makes breastfeeding frustrating.",0
"Package came crushed, box was torn in the bag.",0
Well made item. Great results.,1
Nice toys but some are low in quality . The surface was rough,1
"....because I wish I had. Ordered it having seen all the reviews and this was a newer firmware, so figured surely they'd eliminated the issue of the external essentials hard drive wiping all of the data you'd store there.

"Ordered it the first time and it arrived with a broken leg. The customer service on the return was very well done as usual. However, the reordered one arrived with a different leg broken and we returned it. Poor packing? Hope others have better luck, it is a lovely piece if intact.",0
Don't waste your money. To much incorrect information. This should be pulled from circulation all together.,0
It's only been a few weeks and it looks moldy & horrible. I bought from the manufacturer last year and had no problems.,0

"Purchased June 2018 and snapped while I was using it 15 months later. This is not something I use extremely frequently, so the cause was not overuse. I guess I got me $7 worth, but it‚Äôs not very fun having a resistance band snap when you‚Äôre using it...",0
"Read full description. Noises were ""scary""and terrified both our kids.",0

"I have recently started using my jojoba oil, I have used it as a facial oil in my nighttime routine and I love love love it!! A couple drops max goes a LONG way! I love how it rubs in very nicely and does not leave you oily at all. I am very impressed and will be looking at purchasing the rest of their products to try out as I also love the body butter!!! I know I have said love alot but I do also love the details in the packaging, everything you need to know is on every side of the box and bottle as well and you can use this oil very many more options then just your face such as, whole body, face, in your hair ect look it up, the options are endless!!",1
Read closely....it's an expansion set...not the game,0
Surprisingly ineffective product in very nice packaging. The reagents aren't anywhere near enough for 40 tests. The plunger for filtering simply doesn't work as described. I actually have a background in laboratory techniques so I was taken aback. I had run my samples through a mesh break them down too. Oh well.,0
"It took two months for the package to arrive, when I finally got it the succulent was almost completely dead. Hopefully I can get it to survive once I plant it.",0
All three quit working less than a week of having. I didn‚Äôt bother returning...just tossed,0
was little tough getting some screws tight and the leg rest needs to be a bit stronger .Would buy again as it is pretty comfortable,1
"Pel√≠cula infumable, pero el 3d y las escenas de acci√≥n son incre√≠bles",0

The small wrench was worthless. Ended up having to buy a new blender.,0

Est√° muy bien todav√≠a no la he usado pero se ve todo correcto,1
this is well made except that ours came like it was used. I don‚Äôt if it‚Äôs paint or what but it was all over the set for the hand. see photos. it is still well made and i‚Äôm probably just going to ask the seller to replace the ones that has paint on it cz my son absolutely loves it and doesn‚Äôt want me to send back. it functions as it should but it just looks used to me. can‚Äôt imagine how paint would end up on the items except with use.,1
No me ha llegado el pedido todavia a pesar de que ten√≠a que llegar el d√≠a 12 y estamos a d√≠a 30,0
I tried everything to get my dogs to use this. Never happened. I would like to return it.,0
First of all it took forever to get going. The thriller part doesn't even begin until halfway through the book. It gets interesting for awhile and then boom...it just over. Really unsatisfying ending. If this was a movie I'd say wait until it shows up on cable. I gave it two stars because it had potential otherwise I would have given one star.,0
I really wanted to love this carrier.... I do love all the pockets and it is very soft. I didn‚Äôt like that the front waist band would fold while wearing it. I didn‚Äôt like that the belt would get all twisted up every time I went to put the carrier on. Also the waist would also become looser and I felt I had to keep adjusting. Also we have only used this carrier a handful of time and there is already stitching that as come undone in 2 places... We love our Lillebaby luxe. Unfortunately I think I‚Äôll be trying to return this carrier.,0
"Used this on a sleeper couch with the couch mattress under the blow up mattress and it leaked the second night I used it, wasted my money",0
Las barillas que sujetan las piedras son muy fragiles y se rompen facilmente. En mi caso tras un solo uno.,0
"Super cute boots! Love them, great quality!",1
I thought it would be bigger. It was teeny tiny. Maybe a better description - like the size in inches.,0
it's been only one day and already my dog has destroyed two of the toys . My dog only weighs 30 lbs and is of medium build. Rope toys are completely useless against a dog's teeth therefore I will not be ordering anymore bark boxes,0
My fault for not doing better research. They were more like short shorts than what I was expecting. I'm too old to flash that much flesh.,0
It‚Äôs an OK case the case scratch really easy but did save my phone when I dropped it on my motorcycle in the street,0
"The LED ring works, but the remainder of the sign is too dark.",0
I am very happy with the purchase. I was able to sync in seconds. It also has a cover over the buttons to keep you from accidentally opening/closing the garage. Perfect for my motorcycle,1
Some of the lids were bent and the glass had air bubbles in places. I needed them and had to keep but the quality could have been better,0
"Es un expositor muy bonito. Tal y como se ve. La √∫nica pega que le pongo es que tengo piezas que, por s√≥lo medio cent√≠metro, no me caben de fondo...una pena! Si tuviera un poquito m√°s de fondo ser√≠a perfecta.",1
"Muy bonito, pero ha durado un mes. Se ha roto la tela de un lado.",0
"Considering the reviews, one would think that this is a good quality pop filter. Don't get me wrong, the pop filter does its job, but the quality is very cheap. The thing will spin and dangle.",0
First time using this for a keto tortilla and really don't like the taste and texture. Also the dough turns purple (I read with some brands that happens) Will continue to try it in others receipts to see if I get used to it,0
"These are not the official Sonicare replacement brushes, but they fit great on my toothbrush. They are not very different than the original, besides having slightly rougher bristles. This is a great value product.",1
"Me llegaron enseguida. Son muy c√≥modos de llevar y aunque me agache para atarme los zapatos o por cualquier raz√≥n, no se me caen debido a la goma que tiene en la parte superior. Tambi√©n se oyen estupendamente y no he tenido problemas con ellos de ning√∫n tipo. ¬°Una buena compra!",1
Why are you still selling an out of date version of the book. To a Ham newbie like myself it is not the easiest to figure out that this was not the current version for testing,0

"Viene un pack bastante completo. se pueden hacer pulseras, flores, gafas, cinturones y todo lo que te alcance la imaginaci√≥n. Duracion de la luz de 6-8 horas. Muy recomendable.",1
"This pencil worked great for about 2 weeks then it went into a slow incline of the work once in a while mode. Now, it's hit and miss if it works. Very disappointed but then again, that's what happens when you try to save money and not get the real deal.",0
We opened it played with it and it turned wet and melted in your hand and left blue color all over!!!! It was horrible threw it right away!!! Do not buy this,0
necesitar√≠amos las instrucciones en espa√±ol ya que no sabemos muy bien el contenido y para que se puedes utilizar cada elemento.- gracias,1
"Llegada en tiempo, conforme a lo solicitado y esperado. Como importante pega que el saco pl√°stico lo han introducido en una caja de cart√≥n que, debido al peso, al cogerla el repartidor se ha roto.",0
De momento cumple las espectativas. Lo he probado varias veces y sigue haciendo su trabajo. Muy contento por el momento y bastante √∫til,1
"The picture quality is not too bad, though it's not that great. The sound sucks bad. Like unless you put your mouth on the camera and scream it's not gonna hear it. Battery is not too bad for this type of item. I think I just don't understand how picture quality is rated for a camcorder, it is consistently ok so it is probably the way it was designed to be, my major gripe is the sound which is non existent. I will try a major brand next because this did not do the job. Who wants silent videos.",0
"The lid has broken after having it for exactly two weeks. Water leaks everywhere now. They do not offer a replacement lid, only full refunds after all bottles are returned ( I‚Äôd have to pay for all the packaging supplies so the glass doesn‚Äôt break) not worth the hassle or cost. I was pleased until this happened.",0
"This item is a waste of money, it suppose to charge your phone fast but it literally take 25 min for it o go up 1%. I‚Äôve tested it and was wanting to make a video to send to seller. Don‚Äôt get this, invest in a better charger.",0
Perfect for those occasions you don't need a super long cord! Highly recommend.,1
Helps take pictures without touching your camera and causing vibrations. Very useful!,1
It does nothing except make my lips tingle and shiny. my lips never plumped even a little bit. It's like lip gloss with mentholated cream.,0
"Nothing to say here, they're metal plates with adhesive on the back.",1
"I was hesitant to buy these since the ratio of the number of brushes to the price seemed too good to be true. I've only used E.L.F makeup brushes in the past but some of the brushes in this set here actually surpassed the quality of E.L.F's (at least for me). These are pretty decent brushes, especially for beginners or for people on a budget. The only brush out of the set I did not really like was the fan brush, but that was not a deal-breaker for me. They are very soft and did not shed like cheaper brushes tend to. I highly recommend these for anyone wanting to start messing around with makeup and eyeshadows or people who do not want to spend a crazy amount of money for makeup brushes.",1
"The customer services is great and very helpful. The battery on the other hand is garbage, the pins get pushed into the battery whenever it gets inserted into the psp which then causes it to not work or charge them. Had this issue with the first one and they immediately sent a replacement and same issue happened with the second.",0
Chair was shipped damaged. Shipping box was fine. Will be returning and not ordering again from this seller.,0
past is not enough strong,0
"I am very pleased with every aspect of this camera. It's a little more expensive than some other, but for the quality and reliability you get, I'd say it was well worth it.",1
"On the S8, the side edges of the case don't completely cover the raised/curved glass of the phone, but other than that, nice looking / great texture.",1
Comfortable panties! Fiance loves them on me! Great buy! Thank you!,1
"I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.",0
I really like the way the case works as a stand and that you can stand the ipad at different angles.,1
"These mats are functional, but they are NOT the same color as seen in the pics. Not even close. The mats I received were a very light grey, and not the dark grey depicted on this page. I sent them back. .",0
"I ordered this product for a gift, I ordered it on May 16th my mom finally got the product today may 28th and the condition of the products was horrible . The box was not sealed and it was wrapped with lots of plastic. And the pillows were all flat and deflated. I‚Äôm very disappointed. It seemed like the product was to big for the box and it was forced inside of it .",0
It‚Äôs a nice product to keep around the house when you want a quick and easy snack. I enjoyed this very much and it is the right size bag and stays good windshield for a couple days. Would re-by in a second.,1
"Pros: Good size, almost covers the top of our queen mattress Cons: Not as soft as it looks. Very heavy, but not because the pile of the fur is so lush, but because it's 2 pieces of fabric sewn together, and the backing is heavy, like faux leather. The fur is short, and has a rubber feel to it. My 12 year old daughter said it made her skin feel itchy.",0
Super chulos. Van separados con lo que los puedes poner individualmente o en conjunto. Son de buena calidad. A mi hijo le han encantado.,1
The leg part comes off too quickly,1
They are very pretty but they are not scented and are not soap. When wet they turn into a slimy glop. Not at all happy. I should've read the reviews better before purchasing.,0
"I liked the historical background coupled with relevant action. Certainly, one gets a feel for the trials and tribulations of being a mountain man.",1
"Se va desarmando poco a poco, tiene poco uso y , a√∫n as√≠, cada dos por tres pierde un tornillo, espero no terminar en el suelo un d√≠a de estos. Definitivamente no la recomiendo",0
"El olor me encanta, pero se gasta super r√°pido.",0
"I have a bunch of these and they're all really great. I would give them all 5 stars in terms of quality - comfort and look. However, the orange/grey has given me a rash on my wrist because instead of a smooth metal surface like all the others the reverse side of the little nub which is this round disc is made of cheap plastic that has given me a red sore spot on my inside wrist. so get the other colours but pass the orange/grey.",0
Delicious. Very easy to digest. Consistency a little bit different from regular rice but once we adjusted to that this quickly become one of our favorites. Delighted to have found this quality non-GMO product.,1
"I wish they cost less than they do (and my switch to Square as POS has resulted in the printing of MUCH more paper!!), but these guys provide the best price going for this size paper. Always arrives on time and it's what we need.",1
"Last week, I bought a Facial Brush on Amazon.com. I started using it after receiving the product. When I wash my face with Facial Brush, I feel very comfortable. After washing my face, I feel my face is white.",1
My dell wouldn't recognize the cable on my new laptop. Cable is made well though and will likely work if not using it for charging.,0
Good flavor and no added sugar.,1
Quick game. Do not like that I need coins to play.,1
"This Bluetooth was useless. I could not hear the person on the other line, there was always background noise & the person I talked to always had to ask me to repeat what I said. The ear piece was uncomfortable & kept falling out of my ear. Not a good product at all.",0
Don't waste your money unless you have cheap headphones to begin with.,0
I like the scent. It's very pleasant scent.,1
It seems to run small yet the arms run so long you have to fold the sleeves if you want to wear it. It doesn‚Äôt look good that way. I also had a hard time deciphering the front from the back because neither way for right. I‚Äôll never wear this. I have it two stars versus one because the look of it is exactly what I was hoping for.,0
"I bought this to help with the glide of my gaming mice. The tape is good for a few days but then begins to peel and causes friction between the mouse and mouse pad, causing me to then remove the tape and reapply. Would not recommend.",0
hola despues de haber hecho varios ciclos de carga como se recomienda dura igual que la vieja o menos no es original no la recomiendo,0
The product received does not spray and there is no option to notify seller or return. Says sale is final...guess so when you are selling something that is broken!!!!!,0
The bracket that links the tub with the frame was badly designed and poorly manufactured. I tried to get a replacement bracket from the seller but they said no replacement parts were available. They offered a return label or a rebate. I chose the rebate since I had thrown away the shipping box and I thought I could get the bracket fixed. The bracket was made from weak metal so repairing it is not possible. Hopefully I can find a machinist to make me one.,0
Did not fit my watch.,0
This worked fine for 10 months and then wouldn't unlock with the proper code. The actual cable is very thin so it didn't take any time at all to use a hacksaw to cut it in half. Maybe that's why it's inexpensive?,0
Great fun and entertaining games for this most special occasion.,1
Kept water with no ice cold for 12 hours,1
takes some getting used to.,1
My son loves it! It works great and looks awesome!,1
"It's what I expected, lots of practice drills. For a beginner, some of the drills are more than I can handle now but it helps me to have a more focused practice session.",1
El producto es correcto en todas sus caracteristicas,1
Paint was coming off on drivers side bottom of the car but other than that it was great!,0

Good product. Screen protector hard as glass to scratch,1
"Dog enjoys these, gave value three stars only because I think they‚Äôre a little bit pricey for each one. Otherwise they‚Äôre good for mild to moderate chewers and they still get a treat at the same time.",1
"The story was all over the place. I felt no connection to Evelyn/Eva/Evie, and the ending was anticlimactic. Thank goodness it was a free book.",0

"Es estupendo para principiantes como yo. Muchos colores, f√°cil de trabajar, me encanta.",1
I like the compartments in the bag but I was really really disappointed that the zipper broke on the first day. I am able to fit all the things I need for both my 2 year old and 6 month old in the bag still debating on going through the trouble and returning it.,0
Pockets and strap too tight. Difficult to get things in and out of while wearing.,0

"Got this for my Ghostbusters obsessed nephew for his birthday. He absolutely loves it. It‚Äôs simple enough that a five year old can work it, but fun enough that his dad and grandpa also love playing with it.",1
"Even though I returned it I gave it four stars because it worked as advertised. One should be aware that for the garment to do the lifting and shaping that it does, It requires the seams to be very heavy and I found the anal area to be uncomfortable, however I know with time I probably would have become used to it, but I chose instead to try a different product.",1
"Perfect brush, small radius, and good quality.",1
"Purchased in June 2019 and no longer works two months later???? The button (for arms to release or hold the phone) is locked and therefore mechanism doesn't work....... We love the features of this make & model, but going to look elsewhere for something more reliable.",0
"Not sure if I have a small head or what but it falls over my face at night. Feels nice, though. Does not keep my hair from getting all crazy so I quit using it.",1
The product looks very good...but sadly it came all broken,0
"Las ruedas me han llegado bien, pero al usarlas no acaban de rotar bien, se les ve que son de baja calidad.",0
Terrible!!!! I couldnt even attach it to the screen,0
These pads are too small. Sometimes a pad will get bunched up while I‚Äôm using it and get stuck in my dog‚Äôs mouth.,0
"Cute. Has to be really sunny for it to move, but I like it a lot.",1
"It was working fine for a while but recently it decided to stop charging after a few minutes of being activated. I need it to charge my phone until it's dead, not to stop charging seconds after I activate it. The first one I bought worked fine, but this one is very unreliable.",0
It wasn't the size in the picture never again going to buy this product,0
This product died after a month. When it did work seems like there was a delay in the voice and th e people on screen talking.,0
La parte donde est√°n los n√∫meros se puso amarillo en menos de una semana. Por el resto bien.,0
Looks great but pockets are smaller than I expected,1
It was just like they said it was,1
This would have been 5 stars except ours had clearly been opened and used! and we needed it for a present urgently :(,0
The back vents were cut uneven so they did not fit. I was only able to use the front ones.,0
"Love these duffle bags, I bought three for my 3 boys and they are the perfect size for a weekend trip or to use for sports! They were a little smaller than I pictured but will definitely get the job done! They are made very nice and seem very durable, can‚Äôt wait to use them for our spring break trip!",1
"The product fits fine and looks good. turn signal and heated mirror work. Unfortunately, the mirror vibrates on rough roads and rattles going over bumps. Plan to return it for a replacement.",0
"Son unos pl√°sticos muy malos, son muy finos y de tama√±o justo, por lo que entran muy pocas hojas, y, adem√°s, se doblan muy f√°cilmente. No lo recomiendo y no lo volver√≠a a comprar. Ni siquiera los voy a usar.",0
I bought 2 and both remotes stopped working first 5 min of useing them,0

The vacuum and the charging base did not work together. The vacuum only lasted a few minutes. Tried to fix but no luck. Really was a waste of money. Could do better with a simple little broom.,0

"Me ha gustado bastante, es muy potente para el tama√±o que tiene y se encucha bastante bien. Su dise√±o vintage est√° muy conseguido. Lo malo es que no funciona el puerto de los auriculares, Le he conectado m√°s de diez auriculares distintos y no funciona.",0
Very nice. Well made. Too is a bit smaller than the bottom.,1
"Although it was a little difficult to install on my 3D printer, it probably wouldn't be for many. My Maker Select V2 was never designed for it and I had to rewire the machine to allow it to work. That isn't of any fault to the BLTouch. It's worked flawlessly.",1
"Felt, need I say more? From the picture I thought I was buying a soft, silky flower.",0
Si la calidad y el precio son correctos. Muy r√°pida la entrega.,1
"Came safely bubble wrapped. Haha. The only bad-ish thing was that there were large pink marks underneath bulbasaur's feet. Not a big deal since you wouldn't see it when it's standing, but it was a gift so I hope it didn't look too cheap. My friend seems to really like it though.",1
"I'm using this File Folder in my office at home, I like the different colors and that it has 12 pocket expanding file folder. It helps to organize all my papers.",1
"I ordered this in the XL size thinking it‚Äôd fit my XL dog (English mastiff). I would compare to a small child‚Äôs blanket. It‚Äôs nice and soft but the size is completely throwing us off, the dog doesn‚Äôt even fit on it. We are giving it to the kids to use and buying a large Costco blanket for the dog..... perfect for little dogs but don‚Äôt let the size fool you....",0
Very good price for a nice quality bracelet. My sister loved her birthday present! She wears it everyday.,1
Started using this light for my newly propagated succulent leaves. Seems perfect for those spaces that you want plants but don't get much sun. After a week so far the succulents seem happy.,1
"Never actually got to try the product. It came in the packaging, with some sort of tape over the bottle and loose powder all inside the package. There was also no inner protective seal. Quite frankly it looks like it was a used product that was shipped to me. Returning for a refund.",0
I bought these chocolates for the tin. Lol. The chocolates are yummy!,1
Works great for the older xbox,1
"I've purchased black seed oil pills from multiple companies and I cannot be without them. When it was time to repurchase I chose this brand based off the added ingredients (honey). When I received the product I liked the dark color and I noticed the ""dark residue"" in each capsule. After doing my research, I found that quality black seed oil (unrefined) should have this residue. So far this product is standing up to quality.",1
I really like these! Easy to install and they look great.,1
"Ya hab√≠a tenido otra correa de otra marca que se rompi√≥ al a√±o. Esta, se ensucia f√°cilmente y ni no es tan buena en el im√°n. No termina de convencerme tras meses de uso.",0
"Screws are a bit short, but still really pretty.",1
"se ajusta perfectamente, es suave y se nota que es de calidad.",1
"El pedido ha venido muy r√°pido, en un par de d√≠as estaba en casa. La conexi√≥n con los dispositivos es r√°pida tambi√©n pero el sonido no es bueno, suena a lata. La verdad es que con el precio que tiene esperaba algo mejor, ya que he tenido de otras marcas m√°s econ√≥micas y sonaban mejor.",0
These are really nice straps. Great material and well made. They‚Äôre very comfy and look durable. I like that you don‚Äôt have to wrap the straps around the bar so they‚Äôre super quick to use. They support the wrists nicely and the metal wedge at the end of the strap prevents slipping. Really happy with my purchase.,1
3 of the ornaments were broke or defective. üò©,0
"These have an off and on switch which allows me to listen to calls via my pc. I connect my headset to it via USB and when I want to speak via my pc, I switch it to on and then I can talk. Would have given it 5 stars if the cable was a little longer.",1
Perfect for transferring items up and down the basement steps. Absolutely the best item I purchased for this purpose. Definitely no problem. Very strong and easy to use,1
"Muy buena pinta llevando pocos d√≠as de uso, se ve muy resistente a golpes, y ya toco el suelo un par de veces, eso si, hace el tel√©fono enorme, pero la recomiendo",1
trash!!! not working ... don't loose your money.,0
Had to buy batteries for it even though there were 3 in the handle. They were dead since the light was in the on position. Not real happy about that.,0
"I don't know what the 1.25"" dremel diamond wheel can do compared to these smaller wheels, but three of them cut through 2 feet of 1/2"" thick porcelain tile, which comparatively, is $3 worth of material as opposed to $25 for one dremel wheel.",1
I bought the clear. They aren't flimsy and they do what they are supposed to do.,1
"La verdad que el producto me gusta , el problema es que nunca ha llegado, contact√© con el vendedor , y dec√≠an que se hab√≠a extraviado, fui paciente le ped√≠ que me lo enviasen de nuevo me dieron plazo de 30 d√≠as y de nuevo se ha extraviado , finalmente he solicitado el reembolso de mi dinero , vendedor poco recomendable debido a su mala gesti√≥n en cuanto a los env√≠os",0
Great for $10 Halloween wig hair. Not good for daily wear. Sheds A LOT!,0
"Me encanta,le√≠ opiniones que decian que la caja la mandaron en rosa pero a mi me ha llegado negra tal cual como indica en la descripci√≥n,me ha gustado mucho ,lleva muchas letras, dibujos emoticonos est√° super bien para el precio que tiene,me lleg√≥ el dia previsto de entrega,osea que muy contenta con la compra.",1
"After going thru all the prescribed cleaning procedures, it still did not stick! Expected more from such an expensive screen protector",0
I purchased this clock for my sewing room. It looks great! I think the price point is high for the size of clock.,1
One didn‚Äôt last 1 month and the other less and 6 months. Junk!!,0
This vegetable steamer is a great product at a great price. It keeps the veggies crisp and is easy to use.,1
I didn't care for the loose fit of the boots on the legs and how the top falls down a bit. They aren't bad but I purchased a different & cheaper pair and was so much more satisfied and impressed by them.,0
"One of the products I received has a hole in it. It is not a problem necessarily, since I could still wear it under something, but still not very disappointing.",0
No matter what we tried we could not get our newer laptops connect to an old projector with this. Multiple computers would not communicate with it.,0
THE EDGES FRAYED AND FELL APART AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS USE. THIS PRODUCT IS TOTAL JUNK GIVEN THE PRICING. CANNOT TRUST SPECK ANYMORE.,0
"It felt like reading a college text book. Way to much detail, he could have simplified things. He‚Äôs all over the place, not a consistently written book. I like Tom Friedman but this book was a waste of time. Not worth reading.",0
"Gave this as a Christmas gift. Package was damaged (probably previously ordered, opened, and returned) and was missing the base station.",0
"me gusta mucho, pero venia roto. Esta roto el soporte de las barras de incienso y lo peor es que no se ha partido por el transporte. La caja y el embalaje venian en perfecto estado. Lo han enviado roto. Ni siquiera estaba el trozo que falta en la caja. Mal servicio",0
Did not order; returned,0
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He will get it in his Easter Basket on Sunday. I cannot rate this item until he uses it and we see how it works.,0
product worked for 30 mins then quit,0
"Empezando dir√© que lo he comprado para algo para lo que no esta dirigido, para pulir el panel transparente de un caja de ordenador, no ha eliminado todos los peque√±os ara√±azos que este tenia pero tengo que reconocer que despu√©s de pulir la superficie se ve bastante mejor. Seguramente si tuviera ara√±azos mas graves los habr√≠a eliminado sin problemas.",1
"Never recieved this item... First bad experience on amazon. No reply from seller. 3rd party seller, will NOT do again if I can help it.",0
I just started using the product so not sure how it will work. I have put it in my shampoo and it smells good.,1
"We've all been lied to, that's a fact. Andy Andrews shows us the depth we have sunk to by the lies. We need to expect truth from those in the political arena or elect those people that will speak the truth. You don't want your friends to lie, why accept it from elected officials. Apathy is running rampant. We need to be able to discern truth and it can only be found if we are willing to look for it. Check things out, don't always take what someone says as truth. A short, but powerful, book.",1
I paid for 40 feet of chain and received 33 feet.,0
Bought this version because the lid looked like an improvement on previous models. It‚Äôs not. The water leaks everywhere and the only place it can be used is in a bathtub or outside. I paid more money to get the new lid and I should ha e just gone with the original model. Really disappointed with the product.,0
These are really cute. Fit my 1 year olds head and she will even leave it on for a few minutes! I was disappointed that the blue color is actually more of a dark teal and the red color is actually more of a burnt orange. I'm having a hard time matching these to her clothing.,1
Does not look leather or anywhere close to leather like pic. Shiny,0
"Very nice and well built. It sure does shine. I bought the 3qt. size , when I should have purchased the 6qt. but it was of such a quality I decided to just buy a 6qt. in addition to this one.",1
It only kept my coffee warm for about 2 hours.,0
It definitely helps curb your appetite! I found it helps me to take two pills.,1
"Feels flimsy, and the spinning feels a bit uncontrolled, considering you‚Äôre doing work that requires control. Also, the design on top of the turntable is grooved. Take note of the lines radiating out from the center, all the way out to the edge; if, with icing, your cake is basically the same width as your cake board (it‚Äôs what I had on hand), then the cake comb sits on the turntable itself and catches in the grooves every single time, making a smooth finish impossible, no matter what size cake you put on there.",0
"Bien, no se porque motivo , quiz√°s porque es un art√≠culo reacondicionado de Amazon; pero estos limpias ,todo y dejar bien seco a cada pasada el cristal, hacen mucho ruido. O son utilizados o no me explico el motivo de este excesivo ruido de una de las mejores marcas del mercado....",0
Material not good quality. I have washed two times and it has shrunk.,1
"Assembled the unit, tried to use it. The 42mm nor the 40mm Apple 4 watches fit on the stand. There was not enough clearance at the bottom for them to align with the charger. Super bummed, am returning.",0
Justitos de calidad. Traen un estuche muy chulo y pr√°ctico para guardarlos. Ya no tengo m√°s que decir por ahora.,0
"This was a great replacement for the bottom of our couch, but it was slightly too small to cover the bottom, so we tried to use three pieces to cover the entire bottom of the couch (to cover the holes our cats made) they, of course, found the seams between the layers and tore it out again. Would recommend if bottom of couch/chair is small enough to cover with a single piece of fabric. Was really easy to unfold/install (we used a staple gun to attach). Would order again if a larger width is available.",1
Downloaded the app after disconnecting my cable provider to watch shows that I enjoy and to see any of them you have to sign in thru your cable provider. Really disappointed!!,0
I use this heat tape every day with my business. Great quality and easy to remove,1
"All 4 cables are working fine. Charged Iphone 5s, 6s and Ipod. 6 feet cable is long enough. worth money.",1
This pillow is way too small. My baby was unable to reach my breasts to latch. The pillow is all squished. Also it‚Äôs mentioned in the product description that it comes with a small head positioning pillow but I never received any. Would not recommend this as a feeding pillow,0
"The sf 666 microphone I ordered,was suppose to come with usb.It did not.I needed that.Now what?",0
No me gust√≥ porque es m√°s peque√±o de lo que esperaba y no cabe por la pulsera,0
When we received the scoreboard it was broken. We called for support and left our number for a call back. 3 days later no call. Terrible service!,0
"I had read that with these kinds of devices you have more success with males dogs which I have a male dog so thought i'd give it a go. The first two days he sniffed it real good but it did NOT trigger a urine response from him. Now, days later he pays it absolutely no attention. So it's a nice idea but I think these things are very dog gender, breed and personality dependent as to if they'll work for you or not. At least they're not very expensive so if it doesn't work you're not out a whole lot of money.",0
"These are soft and comfortable. However, one strap tore off in about a week.",0
This product seems to work like a charm. No more nasty smells.,1
No tiene mucha estabilidad.,0
Happy with quality of product and the Gates brand name.,1
Un producto fant√°stico con buena calidad. bolsa bonito y es cierto poner mi port√°til dentro. Muy √∫til para vida cotidiana.,1
"I end up spilling a god portion of the charcoal trying to get it in the bag and with that, they don't last. It may cost me more but I'm going to way I use to do it",0
"I actually paid almost the double of the price for an extra charger on a store that the prices are at the lowest. The value and the quality of this one is equal and much more affordable. Actually, this one seems a little better quality charger because it seems to not be overheating as the one I got at a regular store. It‚Äôs much lighter as well. I highly recommend to have extra chargers because we never know what could happen in only having one. It‚Äôs a necessary item and it‚Äôs important to have a quality one. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this charger, it charges fairly quickly as well, it‚Äôs a big plus in my opinion.",1
Las bater√≠as no han durado ni 10 recargas,0
ordered 3 of these books and shes read them all,1
"They taste alright, but man the price is way too high. You might as well save your money for the vending machines at work...",0
I didn‚Äôt want to write a review cause I‚Äôm giving time to see if is working or not.,0
That was sufficiently weird for a 'I recommend at least starting to watch the film' recommendation. You won't get answers; it's a hot mess ... but it's an unusual hot mess which you _might_ like.,1
Tasty. Seem to have more regular and larger BM. Been recommending it to my family.,1
Crow is a many faceted main character who deserves the depth of love he finds with Ethan. Their love sparkles with well written reality. So far the best of the Sierra series.,1
Really poor quality compared to pictures,0
"Hola producto de muy baja calidad. Se me ha descosido toda la zona de las asas y zona del respaldo totalmente desgastada, d√°ndole poco uso. Solo tiene 5 meses. Muy decepcionado.",0
"Works well, no bricking",1
"Primavera llegando y es el momento de empezar hacer deportes para la playa, as√≠ que he comprado ese accesorio para la bici para hacer ejercicios por la noche y la verdad es que no esta mal, es potente y me vale para lo que necesitaba",1
I received this and it was a piece of thin wood with a picture that was glued on crooked and a thin piece of wire.... sent back ( as instructed) and cannot seem to get seller to even answer that they received the return or anything about my credit!!! Told them to keep money if they needed it that bad.... the only reason for the 1 Star is I wouldn‚Äôt be able to let others know about product and seller.,0
"My home has 8 foot ceilings and the clock was on a self maybe 4 feet from the floor. The focus adjustment hit the stop before the digits were clearly focused (the numbers were fuzzy), Setting the radio was frustrating, I never was able to do it. The light from the projector was bright. Too bright for us, the night it kept us awake and not bright enough in the daylight to see it. It has two settings of brightness but I could not really tell the difference in brightness between the two..If you wanted a night light too you might actually light this aspect. The projection did not show whether the alarm is on or not which my last projection alarm clock had. I found this a little annoying. There really wasn't enough description for me at least to ascertain these issues. The clock did work OK. I returned it and ordered a different one..",0
"El pedido no lleg√≥ nunca. El servicio posventa..., penoso. Excusas, culpar a Correos y decir que la fecha de entrega comunicada es solo una estimaci√≥n y que siguiera esperando. Amazon me devolvi√≥ lo pagado, que no el vendedor.",0
"I‚Äôve only used a couple of them, but they seem to be a little lower quality than I‚Äôm used to. They also come in a flimsy cardboard box that won‚Äôt last long as a storage container. Decent product, but nothing special.",1
