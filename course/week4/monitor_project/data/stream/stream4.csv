"Super cute, exactly as described, very well made",1
Lo usé en unas gafas de descenso que se empañaban y no tuvo ningún resultado. Se empañaban exáctamente igual que antes de aplicarlo.,0
Easy to use and be able to scare animal away. Solar light made it perfect! Size is just right that is not too big. Variety choice of frequency makes it more effectively rebel animals,1
Cute for my little dog,1
Zipper broke right after return period expired. A nice bag but now useless.,0
"Small sticker for a small wall . Delivered fast, good quality, bright colors , easy to put on. Exactly what I was looking for our toy storage room. I wish they have different sizes of this wall decal .",1
Worked as shown arrived very quickly,1
$35 for a two week supply. Way to expensive. Sending it back.,0
"Envío muy rápido y muy bien empaquetado. Barbie de Frida Kahlo muy guapa y con todos los detalles, aunque para ser Barbie Collector podía venir con las piernas articuladas...",1
Ordered a ring June 27th and still haven't received it or heard anything regarding it,0
I ordered a medium but when I received the item the sweater was to small to fit my Yorkie so I returned it then ordered a large it was still to small to fit my Yorkie it was also very cheaply made in China.,0
No sé todavía de su resultado pero de tamaño me ha parecido bien,1
"Funciona bien , pero a llegado sin envoltorio,caja abierta y con las instrucciones de otro modelo , el cual había comprado antes y lo he devuelto porque vino defectuoso .",1
"Producto de buena calidad a buen precio que cumple con las características que ofrece, es una buena alternativa a los productos originales.",1
Range is closer to 30 miles or less not 150 miles. I don’t live in a valley or have large obstructions around. Disappointed in signal strength.,0
"Great way to try many flavors and find out what you like. Some flavors contain sucralose, others don't, which is also important information to me.",1
"After 2 months 1 light or 25% of the order didn't work. Hoped they would work. Now I will have to return all 4 lights just because 1 didn't work. Seller is less than responsive. Asked me to create a movie of the issue, not sure why when it is simply clear that one doesn't light up with motion.",0
good little cart for short people,1
"I've read all the Joy Ellis Niki Galena books and the first Jackman & Evans. Lost Daughters is the best of the bunch. I thought it was very well written (with the exception of a few typos), had a great plot, and the twists & turns kept me guessing. The only thing I don't like is her use of fictional towns rather than real places! As a Yank with a British wife whose family lives in the fens I've spent a lot of time running along the narrow fen roads and visiting fen villages and towns. I don't understand why some authors take their creative licence to the point of creating towns and villages. I'm sure most readers would prefer to see places they can associate with rather than contrived locations!!",1
I fell in love with this case has good grip also beautiful case indeed n.n I would buy again but with different design. Plus the cover feels good doesn't slip at all.,1
easy to put on and has a nice view of the road.,1
"Nice shirts, I bought three, The tail is a little long to be worn out but tucks in well. Material is good and colors haven't faded after washing. I wash on cold and dry at on low heat and the shirts come out wrinkle free. The most important thing about these shirts is they have a pocket. I hate a shirt that doesn't have a pocket.",1
"No me gusto nada,xq las sombras no se quedan marcada",0
"De momento solo lo he probado en cristales de ventanas en casa, pero vs muy bien.",1
Nice selection of oils that all seem to be high quality.,1
"No es verdad que sea compatible, me falló desde el primer día.",0
The bras were so cheaply made. Had to return them,0
"Dear Santa: Children’s Christmas Letters and Wish Lists, 1870 – 1920 by Chronicle Books What I like about this book are many things. Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about. love that they show color photos of a scene during the book. So much history: how the Santa letter came about over the years, the origins of Santa. Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children, living history section and a don't miss area before it gets into the letters. Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60's remember. So many fond memories over the years, what a treasure this book is.",1
Started and idled fine but runs out out of fuel when put under load.,0
"muy buena calidad pero atención porque en un principio resultan muy rigidos y es peligroso porque tienes que tener cuidado cuando frenar porque no puedes coger bien el freno. Por lo demás, buena calidad, calentitos e impermeables-",1
"No permite el auto foco, El trípode no soporte el peso del dispositivo y se cae de un lado mas complicado cuando tiene los cables conectados. Terrible no se conecta via Bluetooth, con dispositivos de sonidos. NO ESTOY SATISFECHO. No lo he podido devolver porque me encuentro viajando, si pudiese seria recuperar bueno mi dinero.",0
This thing is great. It would get a 5* if I didn't need to keep around a USB mini to recharge it. USB micro or USB C would make this product amazing! It fits well in a pocket and keeps a charge.,1
"I've only been using this product for about a month, so I can't say that this has helped me get pregnant yet, but I can say that my cycle has definitely changed since using this product.",1
Theses beauties are unique and made well. Only con it that they turn my ankles and ugly black.,1
Not exactly what I expected but surprisingly pleased with the product. It is quiet and a perfect size for my 20 gallon aquarium. I would definitely purchase again.,1
Easy to use when halving recipes and you need 1/8 tsp,1
"algo pequeña , para mas de 2 años , cuesta que le entre por la cabeza , calidad muy buena y muy calentita",1
"the messages were fine, but the print is very light and sometimes difficult to see.",0
Son mucho mas blandas q en la foto. X el precio estan bien pero las he usado poco,0
"Easy to install, fits perfectly, and does a good job.",1
"Debía darle 5 estrellas, no se las doy porque pesa un poco más de lo deseable, pero es de acero, así que no podía pesar menos!",1
Exactly what I expected!,1
The product itself is okay and my son loves it but this listing is erroneous. It said I purchased 48 pouches but only 1 box of 4 arrived!!!,0
"A los niños les hizo mucha gracia ,mucha ilusión, es un juego muy entretenido para ellos está muy bien. Acerté",1
"Great rackets for the price. We been using it for a few weeks, still in pretty good shape. light weight compare with other beginner level rackets, came with a decent carrier too",1
The most awesome anal toy ever invented!!!,1
Granddaughter really likes it for her volleyball. well constructed and nice way to carry ball.,1
Definitely works for a smaller scale yard. I do wish it came with more nozzles.,1
"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable. I'm happy with my purchase.",1
"I really wanted to like this stapler, I truly do. It's cute and lookd like a toy. Unfortunately it's sensor don't work well. It takes 3 to 5 tries for it to recognize that there's paper inserted and it should get to work. It's quite frustrating.",0
This is the only product my wife uses when she is doing pole fitness. She swears by this stuff.,1
"Tanto la paleta de colores como la brocha son de mucha mejor calidad de la que esperaba. No obstante, NO HE RECIBIDO la Esponja, y por lo que he leído no soy la unica.",1
Calidad/precio muy bien,1
"Tuve que cambiar la talla, incluso midiendo las patitas de mi perro no calzaban correctamente.",0
"The rails fit my handguard just fine. Screws are long enough, inserts are the right size, and the rails have the little circular feature to prevent them from moving around. The problem is that none of my accessories fit the rails. It's like they're too narrow. I tried an Atlas bipod with the quick release and it doesn't tighten up. Neither do my Magpul forward grips. Spend a little extra and get quality rails.",0
Excellent for eliminating splatter in the microwave.,1
"Was the perfect size light weight, we are using it for our trailer. Good for a full size cat.",1
None of the seats grew,0
nice kit comes with everything,1
Was so excited to put it on my new car. Then I peeled the edge off and the outer ring separated from the middle. Didn't look right when I tried to put them together. Why design them separately like that?,0
"Comprado el 15 de Mayo, sigo esperando",0
"Es mas pequeña y tiene menos huecos de lo que parece, y la calidad percibida tampoco es muy buena. Devolví el producto.",0
"Love these, they stay closed and are easy to open with one hand handling them. Coffee doesn't stay hot for a few hours, but maybe warm. Good size (16 oz) to hold in your palm, also good size to stay in the car coffee holder.",1
"Use this for my phone. Works great,",1
"I bought this for my husband, it comes in red and black. It worked well, easy to put on, No issues stated from my husband.",1
NO HE RECIBIDO EL PEDIDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
Box came unwrapped. Only 4 pads total. 2 small and 2 large. Pretty disappointed how this product arrived.,0
La lámpara e esta super chula. Además parece de Buena calidad. No obstante le faltan lo a tornillos y una plaquita para sujetarla al techo. Además de una pequeña rotura en un plástico. Intentaré que me envíen otra.,0
"Terrible product, wouldn't stick tok edges of the phone",0
All crackers were broken and tasted different from the ones I had in a restaurant in Florida.,0
No lo hemos probado pero tiene buena pinta. Vino en buenas condiciones.,1
"It was very easy to put on, no problems there. It definitely adds some bulk to the pen itself which takes away from the sleek design and the comfort of holding it. I have found the pen is not as sensitive to the double tap feature with the case on nor does it charge as fast. The other reviews did state that the magnet isn’t as strong and it’s true so I wasn’t surprised. Over all I purchased this to try and preserve and protect my pencil and this does the trick but it does dull it down some.",1
"Me llegó en el tiempo estimado. La presentación buena. Pero una vez puesto el cristal en el móvil, tal como pone en las instrucciones y además para más seguridad haber visto unos cuantos vídeos en internet de como instalarlo correctamente, quedan bastantes burbujas imposibles de quitar y los bordes como comentaron otros compradores no se pegan. Un desastre. No lo compraría de nuevo. En serio no lo compréis.",0
"Me gusta mucho el olor, tiene un regulador con bastantes niveles, por lo que se puede regular la intensidad de la fragancia que se desea. Compré 3, uno para cada habitación y llegaron todos bien y cumplen muy bien su cometido. Funcionan enchufados a la luz.",1
I returned the product to the Vendor in December and have not received my refund yet. I found the product to be difficult to use.,0
I hope that the seller sends me a new and clean book because the center page is crinkled up really badly. So badly you cant really read the page. I know it is only technically 2 pages the front and back of pages 219 and 220. Please send me the unwrinkled version as this was suppose to be a gift for someone.,0
1 year after purchase and show no signs of wear and our family is hard on cables. Constantly changing locations and phones. Great so far.,1
"The idea is good, gives a softer sound than plastic pick which can be harsh on a ukulele... but I find the felt is difficult to grip and slides out of my fingers while playing.. still prefer my thumb best but oh the blisters after a rockin’ out a few tunes!",0
LA CULATA SE ACOPLA BIEN PERO LA JUNTA ES MUY DEBIL Y SE DOBLA MUY A MENUDO. PUEDE ROMPERSE. MUY DIFICIL DE CARGAR HAY QUE REALIZAR UN ESFUERZO ENORME.,0
"My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn’t budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I’m not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life. I’ll update my review in a month or so, once I’ve had time to evaluate if they’re truly beneficial for my plants.",0
Sellers did not specify that the keyboard and pen were NOT included even though they have it pictured,0
The concept of this would be great but the silicone band (for preventing slipping) is not stretchy enough and makes it impossible to get over my hips. And my hips are not that large... I'm not convinced it would be all that comfortable for a petite person either since the fabric is more stretchy than the silicone. I ended up sending this one back.,0
Some kind of cheap conversion/repackaging of the original DVD set. Returned it.,0
Da mucho calor y las tortugas están encantadas. La única pega es que no tiene interruptor y hay que enchufar y desenchufar directamente. La pinza no se acopla bien al acuario y la he puesto enganchada a un jarrón que tengo al lado.,1
Calidad precio bastante buena,1
No me ha llegado. Paquete perdido. He pedido la anulación del pedido y no se nada todavía.,0
This is crap. Don’t buy it. No instructions.,0
No he recibido el producto,0
It has a metal core. Only the arms and legs stretch.,0
"I’ve had this installed for about a week. Easy to install. Looks very good. Pump works well. However, the two stars are because it will leak about a dime-sized amount of soap into the sink. This seems to happen after it’s been used, like there’s some vacuum or pressure inside the dispensing tube. Every time I go in the kitchen there’s a spot of blue dish soap in the bottom of the sink.",0
this rug is so incredibly soft & looks great. when my nieces come over they love to just roll around on it.,1
Great price. Glad I purchased.,1
Loved it to bad it didn’t fit,0
No me ha gustado nada por que no cubre la pantalla del xiaomi mi A1,0
"Nada más tocarlo empezo a descascarillarse, perdiendo el ""cromado"". Una pena, ya que es exactamente lo que estábamos buscando",0
"No recibí el vestido que se observa en la foto, he recibido otro vestido de Dream Rover de color blanco.",0
"Necesitaba un teléfono el cual me durara la batería todo el día con un uso intensivo y este me ha durado bastante tiempo . En cuanto a la forma es bonito con 5,2 pulgadas de pantalla en HD y con huella en la parte trasera , va bien y lo reconoce en el momento. En cuanto al procesador son 3 Gb de ram y 32 de rom , necesitaba algo asi ya que mi anterior nunca tenía memoria. Las fotos son con buena calidad, la trasera es de 16 mp y la selfie de 8, tiene flash dual. Es android 7.0. Tiene ranura para dos SIM y una sd de hasta 32 GB. Lo más importante es la batería de 6000 mAh , la cual tiene carga rápida. Incluye una funda transparente que siempre viene bien.",1
es el peor toldo que jamás he visto. Tan siquiera hemos podido instalarlo ya que al tensar la cuerda de la primera argolla ya se descosió. Los enganches nada tienen que ver con los que muestran las fotografías. No está reforzado y es imposible que cumpla su función según dimensiones. No es más que un pedazo de tela. Me parece una autentica estafa.No lo recomendaría en absoluto,0
"Lo compré porque el mío hacía ruido. Este por el precio que tiene suena muy limpio, la longitud es perfecta para moverte con libertar por una habitación y no he notado que haga interferencias.",1
"Aparte de que cuando se me envio de los dos que pedí solo recibi uno, el material parecia bueno, si que recomiendo mirar los tamaños de los candados ya que mi dell no acepta este candado y tuve que devolverlo.",0
Entrega rápida y buena compra,1
"Sin usuario ni contraseña, nada de nada.",0
"Es un funda muy resistente y protege bien las cámaras, que en este modelo sobresalen mucho",1
"these are okay, hard for my weak fingers to get placed properly. I have to have help, then they are very nice.",1
"Buena relación precio calidad y para ser el modelo más pequeño las medidas son generosas, material de calidad decente y que acolcha bien.",1
"Las lentes bajan bastante la calidad de imagen, y al ponerlas encuentro que según la lente que sea, tapan parte de la cámara, y con la mayoría no puedes hacer fotos con flash y/o selfies iluminados ya que dan reflejos. En mi opinion, es un producto con poca utilidad, limitado a usarlo solamente de día.",0
Es un GRAN ENGAÑO!! Pone que vienen varios trajes y realmente solo viene uno. Es una ESTAFA. Amazon debería controlar estos artículos y estos vendedores,0
"These are the worst screen protectors I've ever used. I applied it following the instructions as well as I could considering some Mensa candidate put a label over the instructions which were printed on the outside of the cardboard and pulled of the top layer when I tried to remove it. Not the first glass screen protector I've ever had so I knew what to do. I tried to clean with the wet wipe first, but it was dried out. So I opened the second one and it was just barely wet enough. I applied the screen protector easily enough. Let it sit for about 30 min. then put in my belt holster. The first time I took my phone out the screen protector fell off. I tried to re-apply it but it falls off all the time. It also has dead spots where the touch screen doesn't work. Just through it in the trash. I will try a different brand.",0
"The book was written a long time ago and you could tell, oh; and it was an English writer. Maybe that was the problem. It was very dull but I did finish it weeks after I started it.",0
"the side buttons for browser forward and back movement are mushy and not easy to know you've pushed them until something happens on the screen. Otherwise nice mouse, if a tad overpriced at the time of purchase.",1
Las piezas donde va colocada la calculadora no encajan correctamente. Resulta que deberia traer billetes y no trae ninguno. La calidad me parece muy baja para el precio.,0
"Shocked when I opened the box to find that the tool was broken, most of the attachments were completely used up or broken. This thing looked like it had been used for years, then put back into the box, sawdust and all then shipped to me. Check out the pictures! I'm sure it's a great tool, but I'll never know...",0
"I have been checking updates since I placed this order, I checked last night before bed, no update, this morning I checked again, it says my bag was delivered on Sat..no way, I checked my door RING video.nothing came, amazon always takes a picture at my door, no picture either..what a sham, along with this company posting their own reviews, which I would not have noticed prior to the phony message from them, no body is going to post about what a great company this place is, they want the bag, on time in good shape, I wouldn’t use this company again, making complaint with amazon",0
"First of all it doesn't dissolve in water. 2nd of all, it doesn't seem to make a difference in workout with or without.",0
Well made and effective,1
I just tried to use these printer cartridges and they not even fit my printer - so don't buy this product. I am throwing away $$$$$$$,0
"It's nice to have the color variety to easily figure out what is plugged in. Works well, it's exactly what you would expect.",1
"Lo he devuelto porque la aplicación con exceso de calor del sello interior trasero que indica la talla ha dejado el poliester arrugado, algo que no me parece propio de los controles de calidad de la marca. Tengo otras tres mallas y en ninguna de ellas ocurre.",0
"La variedad y los elementos están bien, aunque tienen sus peros. El tripode tiene tornillo de plástico y se ha roto en su primer uso y la muñequera ha soltado la pieza (he puesto en su sitio después)",1
Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I'm not going to take my phone's case (which isn't thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don't buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it's too thin.,0
Esta muy chula en cuanto me haga falta repito,1
"This mat is attractive, easy to clean and store away. one BIG issue is the poor sewing of the 4 corner loops for pegging down to the ground. The plastic loops are ""barely"" tacked with plastic tread so the 1st mat we purchased, 2 of the corner loops pulled free. I was able to sew them with HEAVY threat to remedy the problem. We did purchase a 2nd mat and I PRE-sewed those before use. The only other issue is with large dog TOENAILS puncturing the plastic weave. Our bloodhounds are young an d rambunctious so they have torn a few strips by running across the mat. Little toy dog breeds will not have the same issues.",0
"La realidad es que fue decepcionante, no tiene potencia a mi juicio...",0
Please get more of this water. Every time I order out of stock,1
Wish there was more pressure. But that may be on my end.,1
"The survivor finale aired last night BUT it is available here on Amazon, even though I purchased the whole season!!!!!!! WHERE IS IT????????",0
"the purple in particular makes an excellent blush, but it goes on much lighter than I wanted it too even if you sit there packing it in for a long time. I use a white NYX eye primer so it goes on VERY pastel and hold up pretty well, I haven't tried getting it wet yet but that may make for thicker application.",1
Esta muy bien pero lo de carga rápida no es tan real,1
great movie....I enjoyed watching it.,1
El puerto USB no funcionaba y a parte no tiene botones. Tienes que controlarlo con el mando sí o sí. Y es muy lento a la hora de escribir. Lo devuelvo.,0
Malo calidad no gusta,0
Omg these earbuds are incredible . Totally worth it,1
Does not work. Not supported by device pops up.,0
El diseño de la funda es distinto al de la foto,0
En la explicación del producto pone que es extensible y no lo son. Me han enviado un producto que no es el detalle,0
Es bonito pero no es de piel auténtica. Aunque de lejos da el pego parece más bien plástico.,0
"Cute outdoor lanterns. I purchased two rubbed bronze ones. They have a black and gold color to them. They are not too bad for the price. I paired them with a real black, metal lantern and it’s hard to tell that they are plastic. The candles are bright. I like the timer function. I don’t have to turn them on/off every night and they come on/turn off at the same time. As you can tell, the candles look almost as good, if not as good, as the Luminara candle in my metal lantern. They were well packaged and arrived quickly.",1
"El filtro es de buena marca y está bien. Dejo esa valoración porque llego muy mal empaquetado, con la caja con golpes.",0
"Works very well. It is loud and if anyone moves my car door or opens it will go off. It also went off when I shut my other doors and shook the car hard. I tested to see if it goes off if I lean on the door or near it and it didn’t, so it is not likely to have that many false alarms. If anyone tries to harm your car or break in, they will need more force that just a simple lean or tap. Instructions in English and not too difficult to figure out. Going to buy this for my home door. Would give it five stars if it was more sensitive and loud but t will do the trick and is great for the money",1
I can walk normally on icy sidewalks and streets. They fit over my boots easily and stay put. I took one star off because they look a bit flimsy and I don’t know how long they’ll last,1
No he llegado a tenerla porque al dejarla en el buzón nunca llegue a verla.... alguien se La debido quedar....,0
"THIS IS A GODSEND. I have always walked my 2 girls on 2 separate leashes... One would zig, the other would zag, and before I knew it we were ALL THREE tied up in retractable leash cord. My hands were always full, holding the re-tractor case things. This allows for ONE leash, and each strap can be adjusted to be longer or shorter so you can even stagger your pups on this device. Made of solid material, doesn't make me fearful that it will break mid-walk. Great buy.",1
I love this band. It is stamped 925 and it is very pretty and very sparkly. It looks like the real thing. I will probably be buying another one,1
"El parto funciona muy bien. El único pero es que con el enchufe que trae hace algo se ruido que puede a llegar a ser molesto por la noche, lo cambie por otro que tenía en casa y ahora no suena.",1

"This is a lovely bracelet. I did have to return it as some of my beads have exceptionally small holes, and would not fit. (Pandora beads fit).",1
I read 30 to 40 books a year for work and this is already on my Top of 2019 list. Most books on leadership communication and speaking are stale and hard to put into action from the page to reality - not so with Speaking To Influence. All of the information Laura provides is actionable and easy to digest. I'm a big fan and will be referring this book to my C-Suite corporate clients.,1
Smell terrible and neck is coming apart sent back,0

Terrible experience - table was cracked with a hole in it. All I requested was a new table and I'd pay the shipping. Was declined. I will not do business with this vendor ever again and would NOT recommend their product.,0

"It's nice to have the remote control, but it doesn't work if you're more then ten or so feet away. The lights are cute, but start much brighter and dim down along the line (as seen in the photo - the beginning and end of the lights are shown). The color is a warm white/yellow, but it doesn't send out much light. Would be happier if the lights were consistently bright.",1

"Muy complicado de configurar, demasiadas opciones disponibles y sin opción de alarma de repetición. Inviable la opción de usarlo con pilas (no duran ni una semana) por lo que tiene que estar constantemente enchufado a la red.",0
Bastante recomendable. Yo lo llevo en el coche y sirve para tres cargas completas de una batería de 3000 mAh. Es de metal y resistente. Viene con un cable microusb y clavija adaptador para los fieles a la manzana mordida.,1
Had one of these backpacks for years and time to replace it.... How disappointing the TWO zipper pulls broke less then 30 days after first use. Very disappointing the quality used to be good not anymore. I would not buy this bag or brand in the future.,0

"El producto no se corresponde con una colcha, es muy muy fino y de no buena calidad. Los dibujos de la funda de almohadas están cortados y descentrados. El vendedor además me esta poniendo muchas pegas para la devolución ya que aunque no se corresponde con la descripción que hace del producto me obliga a correr con los gastos de envió y devolución. NO VOLVERÉ A COMPRAR CON ESTE COMPRADOR.",0
The necklace was very nice and beautiful. We bought this for a cousin of ours that loves horses. Although it did not arrive on time. It was a day late and made us late for our cousins birthday party because we were waiting for it to arrive. I am only giving it 4 stars because it arrived late.,1

I bought this for my new Fire tablet. It fits well.. as advertised. I bought this rotating/stand up style because I want to be able to read a book while seated eating or relaxing. It does not stand at a great enough angle. I would like it to be a bit more upright at the highest standing level (there are 2).,1

It looks like some of the silicon went a little bonkers in the dishwasher the first time I washed one in there. It also annoyed me how the metal flowing through the center doesn't go all the way to the end of the handle. Will return and spend my money for better quality.,0
"Muy buen producto, el filo genial, y super fuertes tiene toda la pinta de durar un montón, me ha encantado",1
Muy calentitos y confortables. Merecen la pena. Quizás al principio el tejido está un poco rígido pero se adaptan enseguida tras el primer lavado. Colores discretos y buena calidad.,1
No me han gustado mucho. Los guantes en si son un poquito aparatosos y no se despegan bien los pelos.,0
These looked great. They looked very nice on the wedding invitations we put them on. We only had one break and had a few loose stones.,1
Es un libro para trabajar por sus actividades pero efectivo porque te ayuda mucho a pensar. Además la lectura es cómoda y amena. Sin duda lo recomiendo,1
I really wanted to like this but first when the package came the soap was so strong you can smell it from the sealed package but after you shave the smell that it leaves behind is amazing. Still trying to create a lather was ridiculously hard.,0

"As far as excellent tracking response I give it 5 stars, only took off 1 star because it's really cold since it's metal, but it's very handy to use when I'm on the couch or in bed watching movies. If I'm needing it for games involving track speed I use it. Might be due to my using the heater sparingly. It also has a good padded backing so no need to worry about scratching any surfaces.",1
"Me deje llevar por los comentarios positivos del articulo, pero tras usarla un tiempo veo que apenas dura el olor comparado con otras marcas y tampoco es que huela especialmente bien..",0
This item is very helpful.,1

Lo he vuelto a comprar a ver si me llega para el cumpleaños de mi nieta y está vez no me timan",0
My package arrived with nothing in it?! My cord that I use for my phone is broken and I was really depending on this replacement. I will give a better rating when I have something to rate!!,0
Genial y elegante correa. Encaja perfectamente. Pedí el tamaño grande y me va bien. Solo le encuentro una pega y es que se va aflojando al ir moviéndote. Por lo demás genial y el color es precioso.,1

"Not pleased with this external hard drive. I got it bc I don't have any storage space on my phone. I plugged it in to my iPhone and I have to download the app for it....which requires available storage space, which I don't have! It is also doesn't seem to be quality made. Disappointed overall.",0

We returned that and ordered the 24in with a sound bar. This time we made it through one movie and a couple days later we turned it on to find no sound at all, again! Now we are returning a second and will NOT be purchasing from this company again.",0

"In high school I had an Adidas bag for club soccer that was this style. Being that I didn't know this brand I was skeptical but this bag is even better than my Adidas. The zippers are good quality and the backpack straps are EXCELLENT. Way more comfortable than my previous bag. Highly recommended. The inside zipper pocket is great for keys and headphones for the gym, the shoe pockets are great (size 10 sneaks fits good). Outside mesh pocket is usually meant for a soccer ball, but i use it for damp clothes after swimming etc. For $23, just buy it.",1
"Era muy muy pequeña, la devolvi",0
"Perfect size for espresso. Well packaged, very durable, highly recommended.",1
"Mouth and teeth feel really good and clean after using. Charged battery lasts a long time and the flosser is easy to store and travel with. It does leak a little though while using and a little difficult to grasp without slipping or accidentally turning off, but I should get use to holding it properly.",1
Extremadamente lenta. Tengo otras de meno capacidad que funcionan a la perfección. Pensaba que ésta sería igual. Me equivoqué. No muy recomdndable,0

"Encaja bien, no es rígida del todo",1
"Ha quedado muy bonita, aunque montarla necesita maña y paciencia. Por dentro se aprovecha al máximo el espacio. He montado un estante arriba y el triangular, que deja la mitad de hueco libre, más bajo. De esa manera tengo dos estantes y siguen cabiendo el cubo, la fregona, el cepillo de barrer y el recogedor. Es verdad que la puerta se queda encajada y cuesta un poco abrir y cerrar, pero como escobero en un rincón del balcón hace la función perfectamente.",1
"De calidad muy muy mala, se lo puso un día mi hija y los tuve que tirar con agujeros en la entrepierna. Barato sí, malos también.",0
"We were skeptical in the beginning of the quality of the product but it blew our mind away! We have tried putting different kinds of food inside the bags and the bags worked really well, no leakage or tear or anything. At first it might be hard to close or open the bags, but it shows how tight the bags really are. Great product! Very satisfied! No more single use ziplock for us!",1

"Very cheap plastic. I couldn’t get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn’t work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening.",0
It is very sturdy and durable. Used it for 2 kittens.,0
"El ordenador es bonito y ligero pero extremadamente lento, no se cual es el problema si el ordenador o el sistema operativo wind 10.",0
"Really enjoyed this book . Fast paced, police procedural. The detectives are sifting thru materials and clues trying to find a serial killer, as well as dealing with serious personal problems. They aren't perfect, but that's what makes the story really good- they're only human. Well thought out, no useless filler pages.",1
"Me esperaba más, todo lo contrario a la mascarilla que es fantástica",0

"If you are making a dish that needs to be stirred, do it with ease or you will tear the liner thus defeating the reason for having one. It makes cleanup so easy and leftovers can be lifted right out of crockpot and placed into leftover dish. Love them. Would give them 5 stars if they could handle being stirred.",1
"Siempre me gustó mucho Agatha Christie. Tengo todas sus novelas que he leído y releído durante años. Muchos años después, he comprado un par de sus novelas en mi tienda Kindle y me han parecido malísimas. Habré evolucionado.",0
So much fun with the right friends.,1

Nunca llego el pedido y el vendedor pasa de todo no contestan,0
"Los cartuchos los detecta la impresora a la primera y funcionan bien. El grosor de la impresión es mayor que en los HP y a nivel de contraste y saturación son peor que los HP oficiales, usando tres tonalidades diferentes pero parecidas del mismo color, con los HP se puede ver la diferencia fácilmente mientras que con estos quedan muy parecidos, aún utilizando el perfil de más calidad de impresión. Sirven si sueles imprimir en calidad normal o borrador, si quieres alta calidad para imprimir fotos mejor usar los originales o buscar otra opción.",1
cheap quality doesnt work,0
"Cracked in two places after six weeks, email responses take at least a day for a response. Still working on a replacement after almost a week of correspondence...",0
Horrible!!! I ordered 12 sheets received 3. I do not recommend anyone to buy from this seller! It makes you choose a star I would say 0 stars and I will not buy again,0
"The best thing about these phones is the Bluetooth stays solidly connected to my Apple Watch. Unlike some other earbuds I’ve tried, these don’t skip at all. I’ve had no issues with the battery life... I’ve never had them run out while I’m using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It’s angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.",1
"Plates arrived packaged well. No chips or cracks and the printing on the plates is done well, no flaws or messed up printing. With some plate holders these made awesome displays for my wife's rooster country kitchen",1
Worst purchase on amazon,0
This filter fits like factory and filters air better.,1
Material is cheaper than expected but ok for a crib skirt.,1
"The box was not inside a Amazon box, and was damaged. The waters were all scratched up.",0
My only disappointment is in the color. The Color online makes the pink seem vivid pink which is what I was looking for in the wristband. In reality the color appears more rose gold so don’t feel the product was true to color.,0
it is not working now. Last less than two years.,0
These baby bib are cute. They are soft to wear and water proof. Very easy to clean. My kid loves them.,1
Pros : colors and brightness Cons : use one time in fountain 2/4 lights water got into light,0
They aren’t what I need I won’t send them back it wouldn’t be fair . Sincerely Kristine Brown,0
Love the color ... but didn't fit.,0
"They don't adjust. There is a rough, plastic piece that either rubs on the ear or presses in on the head. I only wore them for 5 min 2x a day to walk dog and my head is KILLING ME! DON'T BUY! Will return mine!",0
"Great items, exactly what I expected!",1
Id put zero stars if I could. Every one of the balloons pooped before we used them. I had them in little pools with water and filled them up and they werent just deflated but actually popped before the kids came out to play. Dont waste your money.,0
"Venía la caja abierta, sin precintar. De echo la caja donde van los auriculares incluso estaba un poco sucia, con restos de algo que había estado pegado, y ya no está. Se oyen un poco mal, pero por el precio no puedes pedir mas. Son para mi hijo de 11 años, asi que no creo que duren mucho.",0
El libro no cumple mis expectativas por la edad de mi hijo es para niños más mayores por las historias que lleva el libro aún no es para él ( tiene 3.5 años) pero bueno sólo hay que esperar a que crezca Las ilustraciones son bonitas y toca situaciones de varias emociones y muy completas ( ya digo que complejas para edad temprana pero es cuestión de tiempo),0
The belt started to slip after a month,0
"It is too small, does not stay in my ear even with different ear buds supplied, the button is not easy to activate, it does not tell me how low much battery life is remaining on my phone. It just dies when battery is dead, I will be returning it do Amazon. The sound is fine but too hard to enjoy because of the above negative comments. Thank you for reaching out to me.",0
"Por lo general es buena compra. Llego en dos días y es fácil de montar. Pero le doy 4 estrellas porque no tiene prevista fijación de correas a camas de canapé de 1,50 pues las correas son muy cortas, aunque si es para un bebe pequeño el peso de colchón aguanta barandilla perfectamente.",1
Stinks like chemicals. I don't find that it is real leather.,0

I had to cut away some plastic pieces before I could use it with my weed whacker.,1
"No issues in terms of working ""straight out of the box"". It was duller than expected in comparison to others that we got that were considered warm white. So we wished it was a bit brighter.",1
"When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.",0
"Calidad media, apenas en la primera caida, normal teniendo niños alrededor, ya se ha rajado de punta a punta así que no vuelvo a comprarlo.",0
I work in a fiberglass factory on the furnace level. Wet this down to help cool me off. It works. I wear a hat over it and I dont have any issues so far. This is my first week with it. Only reason I havent put 5 stars is because Its so new.,1

"Queríamos una pulsera barata para una niña y no pedimos nada del otro mundo por el precio que tiene, pero la información en Amazon es que la batería dura 3 días y no llega a 12 horas. O la información no es cierta o está defectuosa. Intentamos proceder a la devolución pero los gastos de envío con los que hay que correr tienen un valor de casi el doble de lo que cuesta el producto con lo cuál nos la hemos tenido que comer.",0
"la verdad que son muy cutres... para una emergencia no estan mal, pero las he usado solo 2 veces y ya se estan deshilachando... la verdad que lo barato al final sale caro...",0
"Apenas tienen FOV, no son lo suficientemente buenas, ni para lo baratas que son. No son incómodas y se pueden ajustar, pero lo cierto es que no cumplen con lo que prometen.",0
Stay away! Our primary reason for purchasing was the mold-resistant claim. Item was used less than 10 times and started to grow mold. Not resistant to mold as advertised! Do not buy unless mold is not a concern.,0

"Se cayó el móvil desde una altura de menos de 20 cm, y se rajó tanto el protector como la pantalla del terminal. No la ha protegido nada.",0
"Comprado para reemplazar un producto similar que habíamos tenido por muchos años. Este producto hasta la fecha está haciendo exactamente lo que esperábamos de él. Es un producto muy eficiente, estamos complacidos con la compra y no vemos ninguna razón por la cual no nos deba dar el servicio que esperamos de ella.",1
I thought this would fill cracks but the material is water thin like paint. It's also very yellow. This product is ineligible for a return so I could not recommend buying it.,0
"Se ve mejor en la foto, un poco decepcionada. La cadena de cuello no es trenzada, la pedí marrón y me llego negra. Muy finita. No me parece la misma calidad q en el anuncio",0
Strong looking and works great,1
So cute! And fit my son perfect so I’m not sure about an adult but probably would stretch.,1
"The fit of this shirt was great and flattering, but the material was so weird! It was loose and clingy at the same time, I don't even know how you do that. It came with tons of white marks on front, back and at the seams, either where the product was folded or stretched, it looked dirty. I have no idea if this will come out in the wash so I returned before finding out. Two stars for fit only.",0
"Muy bueno,todo perfecto,carga muy bien,aunque se calienta un poco,volveria a comprarlo",1
Fue entregado antes de lo esperado. Viene con todo lo necesario para el montaje. Es recomendado tener un atornillador automático ya que con un destornillador de mano es casi imposible por la fuerza necesaria para penetrar la madera. Calidad precio excelentes. Hay que barnizarla uno mismo pero por el precio no se puede pedir más. Muy contento con la compra. Super recomendado. La madera es de pino y de muy buena calidad. Se monta en 30 minutos entre dos personas.,1
"Una de las cabezas del dragón ha caído. Era un regalo para un colega mío, y, al cabo de unos días, una de las dos (aunque muy bien talladas y preciosas) cabezas se salió del brazalete. Nada que no se pueda arreglar con pegamento, pero, por favor, que os hubiera costado soldarlas.",1

"But maybe l an a snob. Being trained as an editor there is nothing in e-books that drives me crazier than typos, punctuation errors, incorrect words... For example 'he' instead of 'the'-those little things that autocorrect won't catch. One error of that type in a book: ""Okay, it happens."" Two: ""Geez!"" Multiples and l want to take and shake someone. Will l check out the next book in this series? Possibly. Will l continue with it if the editing is no better? Highly doubtful.",1
Product is hard to move and the gate panels are impossible to unsnap. Don’t buy.,0
Nice sound. It didn’t hurt the budget. Small enough to take anywhere,1
Well this is not really a review. I purchased these batteries trusting the reviews already left for these batteries. I am very impressed with the cases that come with the batteries. The cases come with a rubber seal beneath the covers. So far so good 👍,1
Mala no pésima calidad.. En menos de un mes se a roto por varias partes tal es así que la tengo pegada con cinta de doble cara,0
works good not for the kitty though she said it burned after a while,0

"Vamos, pero muchísimo mejor de lo que esperaba! Bueno acabados, aluminio elegante y justo lo que necesitaba. Me ha quedado el estudio con el complemento perfecto. Le pongo ahí el iPad y es como tener el hijo pequeño del Mac. Me encanta.",1
"El producto perfecto, suelo utilizar esta marca siempre, pero en cuanto al servicio de entrega nefasto, me ponen que se ha entregado en el buzón de correo y me he encontrado los paquetes en el cajón donde se deja la publicidad, entre medias de folletos de publicidad y uno de los paquetes medio abierto, suerte que no es algo de mucho valor, pero si hubiera sido algo de más valor creo que no lo hubiera encontrado, me lo pensaré la próxima vez.",0
This is exactly what I was looking for! Thank you,1

My cat didn't want to chew it. I wasted my money.,0
"Though these technically serve their purpose, and are easy enough to handle, I personally wish these were not as transparent. Because they are so transparent, they actually are much lighter {individually} than the picture. You can see the covered Bingo card numbers right through these chips.

I am not as happy with this screen protector I purchased 3 days ago and I got them today I am not as happy with this screen protector. After the initial its alot of bubbles and so blurry it so disappointing and I peeling of right away.,0

Great price. Fast delivery. Exactly as described. Love the extra batteries. Perfect.,1
"It does the job. But putting it into place, in the ground... it was very flimsy. 3 of the 4 broke on the stake no matter how we put it in.",0
"Todo perfecto como siempre, recibido por Amazon locker....un 10 por este servicio. Sin duda volveré a utilizar este método de entrega.",1
"I am not sure if I received a legitimate product. The diameter of the tube is not the same as the diameter of the scope. It looks cheap when installed on the scope. As far as function, I am sure it would serve the purpose just fine. However on a $1000 scope I want something that both looks and performs well. I contacted Amazon and their service was great with helping me get a refund.",0
"Really nice case. The only thing I don't like about it is the back side of the case as it does not wrap up around like my old case and presents a snagging potential. I have not had it happen yet, but it could.",1
El producto es excelente calienta muy bien y además son grandes y cubre toda la cama y es perfecta con sus dos dispositivos de encendido y apagado con tres niveles de calor,1

I love these! They are cozy and warm.,1
Eye shadow came in busted. Huge dusty mess everywhere.,0
"Worked nicely for 2 weeks but now it doesn't always charge. When it did charge, it was as fast as using a normal USB cable but usually 20-30 minutes slower than a fast charge cable directly plugged into the phone.

"Parecía haber sido usado.La recibimos en un plástico corriente sin ningún tipo de información del fabricante ni instrucciones,y para colmo no se puede acoplar al carro de paseo.Nada recomendable.",0
La calidad está conforme con el precio. Para un uso puntual es válido. Hemos comprado 7 y hemos tenido que devolver dos unidades porque venían con uno de los 4 elementos faltante. No se revisa lo que se vende y como comprador no me gusta perder el tiempo en constantes devoluciones.,0

Then my daughter pop up the very next day and told me she had purchase the very same phone as Sister n law! So I decided to give my in law one and my daughter one! And I'm going to keep the 3rd one for myself, just n case I want to upgrade! The problem solved! Everybody is very happy with their screen protector! So am I!",1

"Vacuum in hair clipper is genius. But the quality needs work. I used it three times in four weeks. After the third use, the clipper started to turn on and off by itself. It was like a ghost had taken over the item. Not sure if I got the lucky defective item or if the overall quality needs improvement. Luckily, it was three days before end of return period. Anyway - I think I would have loved this hair clipper. But I am not willing to spend $50-60 to test something with potentially minimal lifespan. Also - this just went up from when I bought it at $50 by 16%. If this lasted potentially 2+ years I might give it another try. But otherwise - $50 for a month of use is pretty steep.",0

Completely overrated. Did not meet basic expectation.

I replaced it a week later with an $8.00 protector that works great! Customer service was great.,0
"Cuidado con las medidas, es enorme. Capacidad para lo que quieras montar y más. Estéticamente es de las que más me gustan, pero para gustos colores. Hay que tener un poco de cuidado con el polvo, nada que no se solucione con un compresor básico o botes de aire comprimido de vez en cuando. Al ser abierta se nota que la temperatura de los componentes baja, cosa que no debería preocuparte si estás mirando esta caja porque se entiende que vas a poner una rl. IMPORTANTE: si vas a hacer como yo y vas a montar un PC y luego hacer el loop de la el custom, cuidado con las rl AIO, ya que como se puede apreciar en la foto los tubos llegan justos en muchos modelos. También se puede apreciar lo vacía que queda sin una rl custom. Por otra parte si la quieres colgar en la pared por ejemplo, ojo porque pesa mucho y si quieres poner el cristal, que no es cristal, es metraquilato pero bastante grueso, va a ser bastante ancha. Otro dato importante es que el riser que trae para ponele la gráfica en vertical es muy débil, a mi se me rompió cuando lo saqué para quitar la pila de la placa, no quiere decir que a ti también te vaya a pasar",1

We have used it for streaming which worked, but that would be all I would recommend it for at this point. We have other friends that have them and all have had issues with theirs as well.

"This product is great, but the instructions suck... also, it took me and my brother over an hour to figure out why the Power Magic Pro wasn't working. We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going. I recommend turning on the engine to jump start it and then try to see if it works in parking mode when you turn the car off. Other than that, this product is awesome! The images are extremely clear. The cloud feature to be able to live stream is awesome! I highly recommend this product!",1
Exactly what was discribed,1
This case is very attractive. It holds and secures my phone nicely. I love the way it looks. Very classy. I have a black j7 so this case matches it perfectly. The downsides are the inside card holder. It's a very delicate mesh that rips easily resulting in cards falling out when using the phone not good ! so you have to be very careful not to overload and rip the sides. The magnet could be more magnetic it doesn't hold the case closed very well. The strap is very thin I had a sturdier black strap that I use on it instead of the one that comes with it. I am on my second one and although they do not hold up too long i like the look and the fact its not heavy. My first case lasted about 3 months before it ripped and looked a little worn around the corners.,1
La máquina muy buena y bonita,1
The produced came it wasn’t I respected. It good looking but the quality not great.,0

"I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend!",1

I wear a size 8 and while I do sometimes have to size up when I'm wearing boots (to accommodate thick socks) I dont usually with flats. With this pair my toes fit snugly into the front of the shoe and the width of the shoe is a bit tighter than I usually like, but not too uncomfortable. I am hoping that as I break them in that issue will be solved. If not, if i were to buy another pair, I would consider going up a half size.",1

The mat itself: The Good: -came with a free gym towel -came with straps and sleeve for storage -came with pvc pipe to roll it on -feels good -the price is good The Bad -the only issue i could see is the material probably would not be suitable for dropping weights on. But then again this is a yoga mat. Overall: 4.5/5,1

Recently upgraded my kids from Fire & kids Editions to Fire 8 HD's. While I really like the durability of the kids cases Amazon offers I don't want to buy two of them at 30 dollars a piece. These are considerably cheaper and offer pretty good protection. The are of course slimmer than the Amazon cases but offer really good protection.,1
"I got my order and i definitely love it 😻 Three tones lights. Brightness can be adjusted from high to low. Perfect for my mini bed side work station since i’m working on my laptop most of the time and sometimes i’m receiving video calls from my family while i work at night i can just use the selfie ring light with stand and phone holder clipped on desk without turning the lights on and disturb my husband while sleeping. Also, you can check the video i attached on how to use it. Very easy to operate. It has power button and other buttons for switching the light tones and brightness. Making this review because my money is not wasted 💕 worth the price and quality itself ❤️",1

The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,1

Seem to work. Just as cheap as the originals that came on the Cargo trailer. Remember the weird looking screw head is likely just a square drive and not a torx or allen.

It cracked the second day and I didn't even drop it.,0
Great item. No scratches and easy to use and very convenient i would recommend this to other fitness proactive individuals,1

I returned this because I failed to notice the size of the product. Found something different with coloring pages. These are very well made and really cute though. No complaints other than my own personal error!,1
Authentic but long winded,1
Lo malo las hojas verdes vienen muy dobladas y aplastada en general por lo demás bien,1
I've become the grill king of our family! I love this set. The gloves work great! Just what I was looking for. The meat tongs are nice and the meat thermometer works perfectly as well. Great grill kit and great value. Highly recommended.,1
"Nice size, fits everything. Inside pockets hold my products securely. Nice makeup bag.",1
"The auger bit is find for my use. I needed to plant blubs around some trees. It was better than trying to dig with a spade. The ground is hard and some top roots. The best way to use, is to angle the bit a little and when drilling only go a small depth and pull the bit out. Do this several times until you get the depth you need.",1
"I mean theres not a lot to say when its exactly what you order. This seller is great and the cables are EXACTLY as needed and ordered. They are better then what i had. High quility. My speed test showed an amazing difference. Amd the price? Come on, best deal i seen.Thank you very much",1

Great flavor and not ridiculously spicy! Hard to find such a nice combination in a hot sauce. Highly recommended. Pretty cool bottle and label too!,1
I bought this rate to hopefully get the hair off of my artificial grass. It’s too soft and it does not get the grass out. I wish someone made a tool for this need.,0
Like the look of the cup but so far 2 out of 4 habe leaked from the bottom....,0
"I got this for my 19 pound french bulldog (runt) and he did not fit in it. He is way too big overall. The biggest flaw with this item is the lining, which is a stiff taffeta like fabric that has no give and is VERY shallow. The outer fabric is a nice, soft knit which has a lot of stretch to it. This sling would be great for a very small, short dog.",0
Una historia dura y tierna a la vez. Me ha encantado,1
"This one little stand saved my house!! I left all 3 heating irons on and left my house overnight, remembering this in the morning I rushed home expecting to see smoke and fire trucks, whew what a relief The appliance stand base was a cool as the wooden dresser it was sitting on. I absolutely love this product!",1

"Aunque en material es plástico (excepto la cuchilla) cumple con su cometido. Su tamaño no es muy grande pero funciona bastante bien. La compré porque se le vi a un amigo y me pareció que, por el precio que tiene, tendría que probar. La verdad estoy satisfecho con el artilugio.",1

"I know this tracker is several years old and the technology has improved a lot since then, so I was really not expecting much. I just needed a simple step tracker that clips onto my clothing and syncs with my phone, and the price was incredibly low so I figured why not. I received this tracker on Friday, and by Monday it has stopped syncing with my phone. It worked for 2 days. I have tried troubleshooting this error but cannot fix the problem. I don't know if its the app or the tracker, but either way it was a waste. I also felt like it was not counting enough steps when it was working. Fortunately I ended up getting it for free due to a delivery error, but I'm still annoyed that it is such a piece of garbage.",0
"I liked the product! They were smaller than I thought, but loved the light show, especially for this time of year! Also the remotes- how fun. Would definitely recommend. I’d love to put them in my moms house, she would enjoy but not sure what her husband would think.",1
"El envio fue sin nigun problema, el teclado ha llegado sano y salvo,el color que queria y el modelo que queria. PERO hay un comentario anterior de otra persona que lo compró y que no le funciona la luz del cursor derecho, bueno pues tambien es mi caso. La verdad es que a mi no me importa demasiado, es una tecla muy pequeña y no voy a trabajar en la oscuridad muy a menudo por lo que a mi me da igual. Pero entiendo perfectamente a la gente que estaria descontenta con este fallo habiendo pagado alrededor de 100€. Yo lo estoy utilizando ahora mismo y funciona como la seda.",1
worked great for my boat,1
I wore the weight trainer twice and there were wiring that started to poke out and stab me in the side. It was fairly uncomfortable and it wasn't that easy to hide under clothes. I wore it to help with my homecoming dress this year and I had to take it off and throw it away in the bathroom because the wiring fell out and it kept rolling up and it was really itchy. I couldn't stand wearing it any longer.,0
This twin pack was for a 2016 Toyota Sienna LE. The filter fit well and installed easy. ( I watched a YouTube video) The filter is very robust and looks like it will work well.,1

They do not work as well as described. They don't stick as they should to the phone. They somewhat hover over your screen so it slows your ability to type as your finger cannot touch the screen like it should.,0
We have enjoyed this tray. It lets my sons color and play with their small cars/construction vehicles while in the car. It also allows them to color and keep busy. It has a cup holder that is easier for my 2 1/2 year old to reach than the one that comes with his car seat. Easy to install and also take off when not in use.,1
"Se me rompio el velcro solo con ir a colocarlo. Ahora solo me queda uno, comodo no es, pero hace su funcion",0
Don't like the whole silk nylon feel of this item way too hot for summer and uncomfortable for something that's supposed to clean to you again very small not for thicker women if you have a flat stomach you maybe to pull this off Constable however it is a hot material so I would recommend wearing it at night when you're going out or something is not something that you would think of cloth that you can wear during a summer day and just don't some cute flip flops it's very hot very tight and weird material,0
"The pillows are soft but you could basically compress it down into a medium-sized purse. They present well but there's very little in them. I like soft pillows but I'd still like to lay on a pillow. They'll flatten out to feel like you're not laying on anything at all. If you need pillows just for show, these are great, but if you want to USE them, I suggest looking elsewhere.",0
"Way better than my previous waterproof headphones. Various earplug sizes included to find the best fit for your ears. Together with 'half moon' fitting pieces a very good and secure fit was possible. Did an open water swim for > 1 hour and they didn't come out of my ears. Overall sound quality good, but low (bass) tones could be a bit better (personal preference).",1
Para ser de la marca stanley una calidad pésima. Sin añadir peso el asa se rompe en dos usos. Espero una respuesta del vendedor. Por el mismo precio hay más resistentes.,0
No me ha gustado nada.La forma entrecortada de las descripciones. Un compendio de otras aventuras mal contadas y resueltas de cualquier manera (sin sentido).Lo he dejado de leer a medias para no perder el tiempo y si eso es una trilogia no me interesa el resto de lo que me vaya a contar.,0
"Garbage product, didnt work upon arrival. Tried on 2 different TVs and just got the ""blue screen"" that so many people on here also say they got. This thing is trash, should have listened to all the 1 star reviews. Do not waste your time or money on this product!",0
No lo he recibido aún como tantos otros envios fallidos...,0
These are horrible and catch nothing. Nothing.,0
My best friend wanted to try this. She thought it was going to be amazing. I’m not impressed. I’d rather use wax. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It pulled my skin if it wasn’t super hot. And if it was hot enough to come off easily it burned my skin.,1

"There are two kinds of double armor cases. You have the cheap ones that come with a flimsy plastic inside shell, and very soft rubbery skin on the outside. You feel like if you drop your tablet, the whole case will come apart. Than you have the flexible inside plastic shell with padding, and thick hard rubber skin on the outside. You feel like you can drop your tablet from the roof and it would be protected. This case is best described by the first description.",0
This is NOT white coffee. It brews very dark and tastes just like traditional coffee. Do not get scammed by this product.,0
I followed the clean instructions and it still was sticking bad. I’m totally disappointed.,0
good quick heating up to temp.,1
Two of the four ink cartridges were empty no ink.,0
"It's great to have a brush that also blow dries my hair! It was a little confusing what the 3 settings actually do. Thankfully, the seller sent an email to explain: LOW--Cool Heat & High Air Speed MIDDLE--Warm Temp & Low Air Speed HIGH--Hot Temp & High Air Speed **Please note that the sign of settings indicates the heat and temperature, not the air speed. In other word, there are 3 level of heat and 2 blower speed. It is different from other hair dryer and it is easy for you to have a confused idea that settings are broke. If you encounter this confusion, please be eased. This helped to clear up the confusion. Good product!",1
I love the feel of these sheets and the colors are very pretty. They look amazing in my room. Would definitely buy again.,1

Seems to be decent quality and holds my phone well while watching Netflix. Could be a few inches shorter for storage but I am use to it now. This item is as described.,1
I was so excited to receive and use this...they arrived broken. A replacement is being sent but highly suggest better packaging to avoid broken products.,0
This is so easy to install and looks great! It does tend to lean forward because the camera makes it top heavy.,1

Una maravilla de banda sonora para una serie de tv/libros de lo mejor que he visto últimamente. La música consigue trasladarte a la Escocia del siglo XVIII.,1
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.,0

"Love this dress! Wedding, school, it is perfect for any situation with the right accessories! The fabric is a bit sheer when stretched, but its soft and comfy!",1
"This item came missing the screws that were required to put the drawers together. I had to buy them separated at a hardware store when they should have been in the package. Furthermore, the wood on one side of the nightstand was bent so the nightstand wobbled and I had to get an added support for it. Finally, when I tried to contact their support about it, the page was deactivated so there was no way to get help with this issue. They look nice when finally put together but the lack of customer support combined with the missing parts and the bent wood lead me to the conclusion that this is a low quality product and I would not buy from this company again.",0
Compré este artículo junto con otras dos ollas de la misma marca porque quería que me durasen y fuesen de buena calidad pero después del primer uso ya estaba lleno de marcas que no se iban. Las fotos son justo después del PRIMER USO! No reclamé y me las quedé por pereza y falta de tiempo sinceramente... Pero esperaba más calidad.,0
"Compra 100% recomendable. La compré para organizar mi mochila para viajar 3 semanas y es genial. Sensacion de orden y saber donde estan las cosas en vez de usar bolsas de plastico.

"I bought this book and the McGraw hill book and I really liked the Smart Edition book better. The answer explanations were more detailed and I actually found quite a few errors in the McGraw hill book, I stopped using it after that and just used this one.

"Got this items and it does not spin freely as others have said. I seems like it came without lubrication for the ball bearings.

The costume turned out to be better quality than what I expected. The costume was a bit small though.,1
"La verdad es que tiene un diseño muy bonito y queda muy bien en el salón. El ruido que mete, tengo un humificador más profesional, es leve en comparación con el otro que tengo, si tienes la televisión encendida ni se aprecia. Lo que no me ha gustado es que no tiene cierre como tal entre la tapadera y la base con lo que si tienes un descuido de agarrarlo por la ""chimenea"" caerás todo el agua.",1
"A mi me gusta. Es tan fácil de usar, que hasta los niños la utilizan y limpian (algo importante) No es que limpie como una aspiradora, pero si como una escoba. No tiene succión, sino que rota un cepillo y se lleva las migas. Esta bien para una cocina/comedor, nada más",1

"These chords are a good value but one of the two is already flemsy on the end to where it doesn't stay plugged in very well after just a couple of months. The cable part of these seems durable but the charging end could be improved. Overall, these are okay for the money especially since they are so long.",1
Poor quality and nothing like the picture,0
Why are you including wipes that DAMAGE expensive mac screens? My camera is now completely cloudy and I'll have to get an external one.,0
"I was very excited to get this. I've actually been reading and considering buying one for months. It came yesterday. As I put it on and tightened it something on the screw snapped so now its permanently stuck on my camera. I didn't have time to mess with it because I had an engagement I was hired to shoot. Made sure my batteries were charged and headed out. I was very impressed with how much more natural it made my camera feel..... but... and this is a big but. 2 hours into my event and both the batteries had died. I had to leave my event go all the way home and get my 2 spare batteries... long story short I lost time, money and photo opportunities. I wouldn't recommend this product just for what it cost me. So now I'm stuck with it on my camera and draining batteries unusually fast.",0
"The box was totally mangled. You could see where it had been taped then the tape ripped off. It almost looked like it had been returned then shipped out again. When I opened the box, the coffee had just been thrown in. The flavor is ok, not a very strong flavor. I will stick to my Green Mountain coffee.",0
"He probado ya dos de las tres, imagino que serán iguales, y es ligeramente más larga, y estrecha que la pantalla, con lo cual por la parte de abajo se mete en la curvatura de la pantalla y queda ligeramente despegada, mientras que en el lateral se queda como a 1mm del final de la pantalla, quedando una línea a 1mm de donde hay todavía leds. No es válida para el MI 8. La primera me ha durado menos de 20 dias",0

"The first night of using this air conditioner it stopped working (in the middle of the night) and the red light went on, indicating that the water tank is full. I removed 3 buckets of water (on the 1st night of operation!). After turning it on, AC stopped working in 1 hour again!!! And I removed 1 bucket of water again!!! So going forward, the AC stopped working every single hour. From what I see this AC has a totally faulty water evaporation system. Don't tell me that the company is not aware of it! This AC should be removed from production and sales and faulty system corrected. For $500 I got myself a trash and a headache, instead of peace and calm and comfortable nights what I was hoping for. If you ever think about this crap, you have been warned.",0
"It's kind of hard to review medicine since I'm swallowing it, not tasting it, and it doesn't have any physical effect on me.

"Como no se ajusta completamente bien en todos los intentos, desde el primero, quedaba un poco levantada alguna esquina por lo que acababa saliendo burbuja y así la adherencia no era buena.

"This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze. Doesn't feel durable. But, all in all, great device for the prices.",1

I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.",0
"I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.",0
"The brush works fine for dishes, and for cleaning cast iron cookware. The bristles will take whatever form they were last dried in, so should be reformed after each use to avoid having the brush go flat. I have used other brushes which better retain their form.",1

It was dried out when I opened package. Was very disappointed with this product.,0
"Para empezar la funda me llegó sucia. La he limpiado pero la mancha no se fue. Así que no recomiendo el color menta por muy bonito que sea. Estaba utilizando la botella a menudo durante un mes, todo bien, mantenía el agua fresca, sin olores, durante bastantes horas. El otro día la puse en el lavaplatos y cuando la iba a sacar se rompió como si fuera una copa de vino. Desde luego no volveré a comprar una botella como esta.",0

"At first I thought this product would be beneficial. I used it a number of times and it did seem to offer some comfort. Eventually I tried the heat and discovered that there was no heat. That was a deal breaker since that was a big reason for purchasing this product. Also, I started hearing noises coming from the product (popping) that were not there initially. No heat, can't keep. So I am returning this immediately. This has probably soured me on these type of massagers since all of them seem to be made in China and the quality is dubious. I had hoped to find something that would relieve my neck arthritis pain but obviously I must keep looking.",0

"Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars. They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time. After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount. I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher. I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars. Whatever.",0

"My grand daughter loved these boots. She put them on and would not take them off. They are really cute and must be comfortable for her. The price I paid was too expensive for a child's house shoes, She will grow out of them before I get my money's worth. Four stars only because of the price.",1

"I was excited to try this with my cricut since the first printable magnet paper I bought would bend/hang off the refrigerator extremely easy. Once this one arrived, I’ve noticed it was even thinner then my previous brand. I still wanted to give it a try and it seems to have a stronger hold then my other brand I’ve tried but the paper started peeling after it was cut. I won’t be buying Avery again because of this. I could of lived with the thinner magnet but because the design started to peel once it was cut then it’s worthless to me. Hope this helps.",0

Mine was cancelled with no explanation and then delayed twice. When I got the camera, it worked great for about 6 months. Now, it won't turn on. It is NOT UNDER WARRANTEE IN THE US because despite them not noting this, it's not a US model. I'm now out $600 to get it fixed with Canon and if I don't get it back in time I will be out even more money due to renting for upcoming shoots. The 5D Mark IV is a great camera.

"I ordered this item twice. The first one that arrived was exactly as it appeared in the photo and in the description. It works well. In fact, I would give it four or five stars. Just so, after a couple of weeks using the first one, I ordered a second one for use when the other's in the wash. At ""Your Orders,"" I clicked on ""Buy it again"" but what arrived is different: the first one is turquoise, the second one is dark blue; the first one is made of a ""spandexy"" material, the second is more woolly; and most importantly (depending on the size of your head) the first one is, as described, 29"" long, the second one is 26"" long. Also, I noticed too late that the listing seller is a different name. Same description, same photo, same item number; two different seller names. And just now I noticed there is, on the same Amazon page, another item being offered like this one, same photo, same description, different price, different company.",0

I used it this weekend to go Pokemon hunting. At the end of the day, I only used a quarter of the charge and my phone is at 100% all the time. Great capacity!",1

"I foster young kittens and let them run around the house freely. Top protect our sofa and beds, I have bought quite a few similar pads, true 100% cotton, in all sizes, from some on-line shop that specializing in items of such, for hospitals and nursing homes. They worked well. I have some that are way over 5 years and still soft to the touch and serve the purpose well. I wash and bleach them constantly to keep the smell off. But they are much more expensive compared to these ! However, when the first ""accident"" by kitten occurred on this one, I could see a pool of water standing in the middle of the pad, not being absorbed at all! when I went to pick it up, I noticed the liquid moving around like water in a plastic plate ! In fact, after carefully folding it up, a few drops of liquid did run out and wet the sofa ! And this was only one ""small"" mess ! what a mess ! Cheaper to buy a tarp ! I now put it by the entrance doors on raining days for people to leave their wet shoes on !",0

I like this fabric. It's very soft and comfortable. It came out of the bag with a strong musty smell. It was fine after washing. Love the throw pillows. Wish the shams were reversible like the rest of the set. They could have easily put the opening on the end so both designs could be used. All in all very happy with this as a warmer weather bedset.,1
This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it,1
Unreliable setting mechanism. Goes off too easily.,0

"The speaker has worked out so far. I have not had any problems with the bracket and it holds the speakers over rough trail (no jumps or anything). As others pointed out, I wish the sound came out of her front of the speaker instead of the side but the sound is okay. It has also withstood a couple of storms. I have mine mounted on my bars facing slightly rearward with the buttons facing the front. I then connected the remote to the neck to control the speaker, answer calls and keep the amazingly loud horn scaring the bejeezus out of everyone with just the remote.",1

The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing.

"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",0
This is the band I received.,0
I have tough old toe nails and my wife does me the honors as I can’t easily get down to cut them These babies are sharp and can cut through my worst nails fairly easily.,1
"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash.",0
The seller is not honest... The product has no date and no original box.. Bad.,0
I love the wallet. Works almost as expected. Cards can not be inserted fully or they get stuck in switching than unable to remove cards easily. Other than that issue the wallet is great. I leave my cards inserted only 3/4 in to prevent issues.,1
"I can not recommend this chair. I am on my 3rd set of casters, and finally figured out what the problem is. The holes for the casters to sit in are not set in the same orientation on each of the legs. Meaning that one caster might be leaning out several degrees and an opposite caster might be leaning in several degrees. I can not simply pull the chair in any one direction without weight on the chair, because of this. I am outside of my return window, not to mention the size / cost of returning an item such as this. I definitely can not recommend this product.",0
Genial. Se la cogimos para que el peque lleve al cole y de momento muy bien.,1
"The glass carafe is perfect. The handle has a beautiful shape but is a bit hard for my older hand to grasp. The lid is a bit small and has this strange filter suspended near the spout, not sure what it is supposed to do. The kettle wouldn't shut off after the water boils. Was it defective? No just had to get out my college science hat and remember that at our 5,000 foot elevation water boils at 2 degrees less per 1,000 feet of elevation. So when the water boils it is only 202 not 212 degrees f as at sea level, not high enough to trigger the shut off switch. An option would be to set it at 195 degree ""keep warm"" if you need an automatic shut off. That is fairly close to 202 degrees. We have used the kettle at least 2 times daily for 3 months. It is so much better than the old metal kettle on the stove. I doubt you are going to find anything much better or as practical.",1

"I do not like the trio of shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner because I do not care for the fragrance of them, I left the leave-in conditioner in and styling gel and it turned white so I'm returning asap. I don't know if I will order any more of their product",0
Great variety. Thank you.,1
Nice set. Set is smaller than I thought. Tongs are really small.,1
Comfortable and worth the purchase,1
"liked that supplier had the product I needed available ,but.... I think my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter could have done a better job boxing my items up. I ordered 2-packs of 6 motor oil and 2- oil filters. Both oil filters had been knocked around inside the packaging box so bad that both were out of their own boxes and I had to dig debris out of the inside of the filters before installation on the vehicle. I was very reluctant to even use them or just throw them away.",0
I do not recommend this product does not work,0
como me pueden decir en la garantia de amazon de la a a la z que no han pasado tres dias desde la fecha prevista de entrega cuando esta fecha es el 25 de noviembre de 2018 y estamos a 6 de diciembre,0
Básicamente la hemos probado en el agua y ha funcionado correctamente para video y fotos. El mando ha distancia también va bien aunque no hemos tenido demasiadas ocasiones para probarlo.,1
This is much smaller than my previous companies.,0
Cheaper at the company Amazon is twice the price,1
3 in a row damaged upon delivery poor packaging dont waste your money until they fix this issue,0
No sé para qué teléfono es. Pero no para el s7. Le falta como un cm de ancho. Lo acabo de recibir y ya lo tengo que devolver.,0
La lámpara llegó rota pero luego la devolución y abono fueron rápido. Gracias,0
Pues tiene gracia la cosa q me mandeis este formulario.cuando el movil y la funda llevan ya con un retraso de 3 días..y hoy tampoco m llega x lo visto.,0
Justo lo que iba buscando,1
"Very durable. Key and transponder fit perfectly. Has a nice dent near the top where your thumb comfortably fits when you turn the key. Only thing that prevents a 5-star review is the area around the panic button. On the factory key shell, the panic button sits in the plastic so you don't accidentally press it. On this shell, the panic button sits out further than any other button. I've twice pressed the panic button while the keys were in my pocket. Not the end of the world, but something to be aware of.",1
Solo he podido utilizarlo una vez en buenas condiciones. A la segunda vez se han desmontado las piezas que cortan la patata y se ha roto....,0
Just what I was looking fore. Works great with my weed whacker.,1
This was great quality. Worth the buy for my husband.,1
I just bought 2 for my horse troughs. One of them has already quit working. It didn't even last 30 days and I got the higher wattage to help keep water from freezing. Very disappointed.,0
"no es una carpa para aguantar contra la lluvia ni viento, es una carpa perfecta para estar debajo del sol y como decoración festivo. ha sido genial por este precio.",1
"Don't waste your money, much too thin to protect your phone",0
"As others have commented, the product is not right. I have used and ordered this and other Red Flower products in the past, but this new formula is terrible. Smells great but very watery and to not lather very well. Unfortunately, I ordered a while ago and just realized that is was bad after the return period.",0
"Lo encontre un poco flojo, a lo q estoy acostumbrada de esta autora.",0
These I love. For sure will buy again.,1
"Poca calidad, compramos una al llegar a la playa mucho mejor y al mismo precio.",0
Great case. Daughter loves it.,1
This is a great tray. The space for ice is not that big but it does hold some. I would have preferred for the trays not to be vented. When I use it for dips I just cover the bottom on a bit of foil paper or wrap. The lids are a plus.,1
Really cute but runs a bit small,1
Stopped working after a couple of weeks. You get what you pay for.,0
Muy bien el tamaño y la limpieza,1
"Mine did bloom about 90% but the green was only about 80% Fun, but I would not do it again.",0
"This is by far the best book about Fairy`s I have ever read. Great characters, very disruptive, colorful. I can actually visually see and feel like I am in Twilight, it is so well written. I got all the books when I got this one and hope they are all just as well written. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fairy world.",1
This grab bar worked perfectly in our bathroom.,1
"Did not seem to work for my 1 month old with gas and tummy aches, however that may just be his development and age and not necessarily colic. I will say that it is a nice quality design and the bag smells great- even if it doesn’t work for your little one, it’s a nice little heating pad to have around the house for stiff neck or sore muscles or even sinus headaches.",1
"Muy cómodo, fácil manejó y muy buena atención si tienes q llamas a atención al cliente",1
"Todo perfecto con el vendedor y producto de buena calidad, mi organismo va mejorando",1
Encaja perfectamente en el Fénix 5,1
No es tan barato para lo que me dura el cartucho..,1
This game brings back gaming memories!!,1
"Way too small, go a size up when purchasing, other than that, they're great",1
Like the multi pockets just didn't like the fit size to baggie,0
Acabo de recibir el producto y me faltan las intrucciones de como cambiar los cristales y me falta la luz para probar los cristales,1
"These coasters are super cool and works well,they would also make a great gift.",1
"Love the gloves , but be,careful if you are allergic to nickel don't buy them they are made with nickel chloride which I am allergic very highly allergic to so that was the only downfall",1
I bought these for birthday goodie bags. My girls are obsessed with squishes. These however are not actual squishies and I was not aware of that. Really disappointing.,0
I love these calf supports and they stay in place and are so comfortable. Love the design and the fit is just perfect. Used the fitting chart online.,1
I love the top so flattering and sexy. My one criticism would be I wish the material was thicker. Because it’s thin I have to wear a strapless bra wish I don’t really need but too revealing otherwise. I wore last night tho and got tons of compliments!,1
Feels very light and cheaply made FM radio did not even work...very unhappy with my purchase and do not recommend buying this one!!!!,0
Have worked great for what we have needed them for. Have gone through the dishwasher with no problems.,1
looks nice for the price,1
"got gel polish off, but took 2 applications after buffing nails",1
"I brought this so that I can use it’s Bluetooth for incoming calls. But voice quality was so bad that opposite party was having trouble understanding then I decided to put wire on but result was same, was very disappointing. I think this one is better when u just listen, definitely not for both way communication. Not sure how it got almost five star rating.",0
Disappointed that it does not keep my oatmeal warm for even two hours. I always use Thermos products. Have two for coffee and they keep my coffee piping hot from 7 am till noon. They keep iced coffee ice cold for more than 24 hours. I expected the same from this food container :(,0
Doesn't stay cold long.,0
This is the most horrible shirt. Does not fit what so ever. Its extremely short. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money!!,0
Takes some getting use to,1
TAL CUAL LO DESCRIBE EL PRODUCTO,1
No cubre toda la pantalla del teléfono,0
"Broke my original band before my Fitbit was 2 weeks old. Great quality band, has been going strong with no issues for a few months now.",1
Bought for a gift ! Hoping my daughter in law likes. The earrings look nice!,1
THE EXPEDITED SHIPPING CUTS ONE DAY OFF OF THE NORMAL SHIPPING!,0
This was super cute. I only wish I hadn’t sized up. I read some reviews that said it ran small so I got a bigger size. I would have been fine with my normal size. Either way I wore it and my little boy thought it was funny.,1
"son tal cual se ven!!! pero mi gata no juega con el, en el paquete vino muy doblado y al ser plastico duro estan torcidos",0
Nunca me llegó e escrito 2 veces al vendedor. No se si a sido fallo del vendedor o de la empresa de transporte,0
"Installing this in my boat, for the price to have bt can’t beat it",1
No lo he recibido Solo he recibido la caja de las tiritas,0
Beautiful but clasp fell apart . I never got a chance to wear it,0
"Buen masturbador, calidad precio increible, el efecto calor es muy placentero y lo hace muy real,estaría genial si hicieran aparte de este masturbador otra versión más grande, lo recomiendo.",1
Could have a bigger pocket for my package but they fit well,1
"Buen diseño, la funda protectora es recomendable, eso sí ten en cuenta que es de las ligeras pero cumple su función, no pesa.",1
Buen router. Lo malo es el ultimo Firmware qu da problemas con las tarjetas wlan que se bloquean y tienes que espérate 5 minutos con el aparato apagado para vuelva a funcionar un rato. Una vez que tengan reparado el Firmware tiene que ser una pasada este router,0
"Es un aspirador sin fuerza, le paso al perro el aspirador y no recoge 4 pelos, no recomiendo esto para perros que tiren pelos ya que no aspira nada",0
Really good dog house. Doesn't leak. For a 5 star rating it would need better anchors to the ground. Over all quite happy with my purchase. I would buy it again.,1
"Its a wallet. I ordered a wallet. It holds my driver's license, other Id.and a few ones. That's what I ordered and it arrived when you said it would.",1
Scent does not last!! You spray and the smell is gone :(,0
The wrap does not get cold enough or hot enough no matter how long I froze or microwaved it. It's super heavy and basically worthless.,0
