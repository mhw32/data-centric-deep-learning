"Pathetic design of the caps. Very impractical to use everyday. The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap. With a baby in one hand opening the cap is a night mare. And on top of these extra ordinary features of super secure cap, they are so expensive when compared to other brands. Stay away from these until they fix the cap issues. We have hurt ourselves many time trying to open caps as they have sharp edges on the inner and outer edges. Not worth the price.",0
"Shoes were purchased on March 6, 2019. My wife wore them a couple times a week since receiving them. April 19, 2019 one of the leather straps broke. Checked return policy and it expired on April 6. One month of warranty? Won't buy shoes from Amazon again.",0
"It's taken me 1 whole year to set this thing up primarily because I have a MAC, so the set up was a bit tedious & with a new baby that's impossible. Finally, I had a few hours to set it up & it took me all of 1 hour to do so. I'm a pretty technical person, so I thought it'd be simple. After I finally got it set up the orange error light kept flashing & will NOT print. We've tried EVERY single troubleshooting option there is, you tube troubleshooting, etc to no avail. Now I'm stuck with a defective printer & wasted time I cannot get back. Needless to say I am beyond frustrated with this Canon.",0
Each cartridge printed once. Both dried up in less than two weeks. I will not buy from this seller again.,0
No light hard to see,0
Sent shoes back. Wore them around the house for 20 minutes and my feet started to hurt.,0
"I ordered this giving the correct size. However, when it came it is way too big. It is even too big for my husband. All they will do is refund me $3 because it was engraved. I feel that it should be replaced because the measurement is completely wrong from what I ordered.",0
Doesn‚Äôt even remotely taste like licorice,0
"I had pink hair, I was taking the color out with vitamin c tablets and dandruff shampoo but I heard this product would help me take out the color better. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I left it on for 20 minutes and when I checked it, it was gray/light blue. I have no idea how it could possibly turn this color if I had no type of blue tones in my hair only pink and reds.. I'm devistated by the outcome of my hair.",0
Chargers stopped working less than a month after I started using them. Very disappointed.,0
I ordered wrong size these have to be bigger than what you normally wear for some reason,0
"The device has good appearance and seems to work well. However, it has a major flaw in that there is no back up battery to maintain clock time in the event of a power outage. I returned it for that reason",0
Don‚Äôt buy! I ordered Mango flavor specifically for flavor and received regular Fruit Punch! Waste of money and false advertisement!,0
This did not say #10 or Messi. This was a gift for my son and he is very disappointed. Returning it.,0
Phone was delivered. Speaker full of junk. Plugged in and gave plenty of time to charge to 100% unplugged it and was at 5% in less than 10 min not even in use,0
"Split three of them within four hours of use. They were very comfortable prior to failure. Too bad, they did not last. Junk",0
charges for a few minutes then stops. utter garbage.,0
"Wired it up. At first it was fine, then it flickered, and now nothing. ""Not eligible for returns."" :(",0
Was not too happy. Product reduced the touch sensitivity on the right side of phone Took off phone Due to annoyance.,0
"I certainly must have got a fake Sebastian! Purchased this for its reputable name however I am so disappointed, it does not hold my hair and the smell is dreadful. Never want to buy this product again. Please check details before you buy!",0
It comes with two cords but only one of each head. I only have Apple products so I could only really use one cord at a time and then the lightening head for Apple products stopped working in less than a month so I returned the product. Also it doesn‚Äôt work well if your case has a cover over the charging portal and the cord disconnects really easily.,0
"The mattress topper is not comfortable for a couple, especially if they cuddle at night. The mattress concaved around my wife and I to the point that if either of us was close to the other it felt like we would fall into their hole. It was a lot like sleeping on a sagging air mattress. Maybe this topper is comfortable for those that sleep alone or maybe mine was defective - I have no idea why it is so highly rated on Amazon.",0
"We put too much salt in our pool, way too much thinking the rain had diluted it. But it turned out to be an issue with the system. I fixed that and have been wasting water for about 25 min 4 to 8 times a day for the last three days. That is about 3"" to 4"" of water with each waste and then we fill it back up and do it again. The numbers have dropped with my other testers, but have remained the same every day with the strips. How is that possible? I will keep using this bottle just to see how long it takes for the numbers to go down.",0
"I have just receive this product and while the outer security seal seemed intact, the lid came off easily without breaking the seal and the inner seal was not intact.",0
Too bulky in the middle,0
I received an email from the company concerning this product. It said if I put any credit cards in the pockets they will possibly be ruined. I received this email after I bought this product. Please take my advise and don‚Äôt buy this product.,0
"I thought this would be a great gift for my eight-year-old grandson and he was wildly excited about it, but the screws were so tiny and hard to handle and the holes for them so misaligned, that assembly was nothing but frustration for both of us. I ended up returning it.",0
"I bought a set of these and when they came one side had no audio. I returned them and figuring it was a fluke, I purchased them again. After charging them, I unplugged them from the charger and the bottom broke off exposing the wires. One button also wouldn't push when pressed. DON'T BUY",0
Broke in the first week don't waste your money,0
Did not work on 2005 F-150 like description claims,0
"Crap, I'd like money back. Lousy story line, if thats what its called, lots of shooting but very few scenes of aliens.",0
Strange products not advertised with jalape√±os and nothing good. All chips were packed on top and smashed.,0
Never received product. Very disappointed.,0
"The pencil feels good in the hand however when I write I feel a clicking between the red plastic ring and the metal, I am not that heavy-handed because I write daily with an extra fine point gold tip fountain pen. I was expecting more for the price, maybe I received a fake, not worth my time to research. I would not recommend this to anyone due to my experience.",0
Listing says brushed nickel. Box arrived and labeled satin nickel. Waste of time. Simple description and they got it wrong.,0
What a wast of money. They fall apart and are hard to light and when they do burn they don't burn slow.,0
Product is innacurate. Temperature off by several degrees.,0
Waste of money. Bought this item as a gift and I would be to embarrassed to actually give it as a gift. For the price of this item you would think the materials and hardware would be much better. The directions are confusing. The cam lock nuts broke about 50% of the time. I think they were made out of the cheapest materials they could find. We had to go to the hardware store and buy reinforcement pieces because the actual pieces broke. Don't waste your money on this item. This Walmart quality but the price definitely is not.,0
"I RECEIVED AN EMPTY ENVELOPE- SEALED, BUBBLE ENVELOPE - and this is the SECOND TIME THIS MONTH THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED WITH AMAZON!!! BOTH HAD HUGE BUBBLE WRAP ENVELOPES, both SEALED, and both 100% empty with nothing inside no paper work, no item - NOTHING. I contacted the post masters/carriers in both cases and they claim ZERO fault ; telling me to ‚Äútake It up with AMAZON‚Äù but contacting amazon is Next to bloody impossible!!!! I‚Äôm disabled with a brain tumor so I use amazon daily - but after over a decade off patronage now I am beyond panic ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
"Ordered the Cherry Jolly Ranchers and none of them taste like cherry! I have ordered these several times, but this last bag was not right! The wrappers say cherry, but clearly is not!",0
A year subscription of Eating Well was purchased as a gift in Dec 2018. To date-as of July 2019- the gift issues still have not been received. We are very disappointed. We have a 1 star rating as a zero rating was not accepted by the system.,0
Too thick and big. Unattractive.,0
Cheaply manufactured but good whilst it lasts.,0
I do not recommend this product does not work,0
"Never recieved this item... First bad experience on amazon. No reply from seller. 3rd party seller, will NOT do again if I can help it.",0
"Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a bit too tight. My main concern is how extremely thin they are. They feel cheaply made and am certain they'll snag/run my first wear.",0
"My husband said they were comfortable and all, but the second time he wore them the seam was already splitting up the back. And he doesn't have much of a butt, so it wasn't due to added pressure!",0
I only got one pillow on the order even tho you pay for two. Also it is way darker than the picture shows. Not real happy about this order. I can‚Äôt seem to get ahold of anyone to get my other pillow.,0
SENT ONE ORDER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. AMAZON GOT A SUPPOSED FREE REPLACEMENT. NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR THE OTHER ORDER. WASN'T MY FAULT THE VENDOR MESSED UP.,0
"Very cheap plastic. I couldn‚Äôt get the drawers to open one at a time they all slid open when trying to open one. I even filled them up with items hoping they would then slide better, but it didn‚Äôt work. It is also very noice and squeaks when opening.",0
My kid was able to unleash himself within minutes.,0
Lights constantly flicker,0
Posts were not coated.,0
I ordered this item two months ago and never received it. I also contacted the seller who did not contact me back. I feel as if my money was stolen.,0
I like the weight of the jacket but after standing in a heavy rain my back was damp.,0
Didnt fit my low beams.,0
"Ordered this item, received peppermint instead of bergamot. No returns allowed so I ordered bergamot again and kept the original peppermint. 2nd order arrives ALSO PEPPERMINT instead of bergamot and it‚Äôs broken, coating my hands and the rest of my mail with peppermint. The kicker? It turned my fingers orange! Never ordering from this company again.",0
Broken when it arrived. I was able to basically tape it together as it was the handle but it just doesn't work well,0
These stockings already had a huge run in them when I opened them up. Otherwise they would have been great.,0
I just got it today and I put some new battery in it and it‚Äôs not turning on at all.,0
Beautiful shades but they are drying and do not apply well. Not worth the purchase.,0
"The holes were off in my stand so that made the basic structure a little lopsided, which I was going to go with for the price that I paid for. THEN, both the back of the stand and the drawer base were too small. I went on to the website to request new ones and just continued to build. THEN, the drawer doesn't fit because the drawer is lopsided and the stand is lopsided. Look, I get it, I paid for a bad quality nightstand, but I couldn't even use or finish building it!!!!!!! Now I have to carry it to a UPS store to return. So disappointed....",0
The back is so flimsy and does not provide any protection for the tablet. I returned it.,0
Stopped working after a month. Inside battery compartment is rusted out.,0
"Try to take it out from the case and it opens to the core. Try to contact the seller, never respond.",0
Didn't work. Food not crisped at all - even though I tried multiple times raising both temperature and cook time.,0
This what a bad choice for me. The pockets in these chair covers are cheaply made. The material is extra thin as you can see. I placed these on one of the folding chairs & as you can see it ripped due to the material being extra thin. They did however come on time as promised . I wish I would have made another choice. I don‚Äôt recommend these chair covers. I will be returning the Un open box of 50 that I wasn‚Äôt able to use.,0
"Do not purchase this toothbrush. There is a serious problem with the battery, we have to change it after only 2 weeks of normal use. And there is mold inside the toothbrush. Really disgusting!",0
"Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",0
"I received this bag today, it looks very cute and unique. However, be aware that the dimensions described are not right. The bag is very small, and likely would just fit your phone and the keys. Going to return it.",0
3 in a row damaged upon delivery poor packaging dont waste your money until they fix this issue,0
"I ordered this product and they charged shipping that was just as much as the product itself!!! Then try and find someone to contact, yeah right. Got screwed again.",0
Super disappointed. 4 out of the 6 were damaged like the one you see in the pictures. 2 of them didn‚Äôt even turn on. Had high hopes for these,0
"A lot smaller than I expected, couldnt use it. I gave it away. Good for kittens, not regular cats.",0
My first one star review since 2012. Save the packaging if you already bought the garbage.,0
Prettier in picture then in person,0
Add me to the list of people that feel like they bought junk. Mine leaked all over inside the case also on the first use. Made a huge mess when I picked it up after the oil pumped out. Would not recommend.,0
"Be careful. This can be comfortable in s chair, but I wanted it for my car. It really jammed my lower back! I had to pull over to get it out from under me. What a waste!",0
"Arrived out of box, no seal. Pretty disappointed. It was a great price - guess I should of known better. Trashed it, didn‚Äôt want to use something that was already opened and or used. I‚Äôll order directly from their site for safety.",0
Great book. Terrible delivery. Came out of the package mangled. Not cool Amazon,0
"A total piece of crap!!! I bought it in June 2019, tested it when I got it, put it in a drawer. It sat there until now, end of October. When I needed it to use it, it's dead as a door nail! DO NOT TOUCH THIS ITEM!!!",0
THE EXPEDITED SHIPPING CUTS ONE DAY OFF OF THE NORMAL SHIPPING!,0
Fell off immediately,0
"I received an adidas tank top, not the makeup I ordered. I was skeptical of buying this makeup initially given that many people received the wrong makeup, but I was not even sent anything closely related to what I intended to buy.",0
"Don't waste you money, don't work",0
The worst product I ever received from amozon... suction cup doesn't stick to any surfaces I tried to stick to I threw it in the trash can,0
Terrible experience - table was cracked with a hole in it. All I requested was a new table and I'd pay the shipping. Was declined. I will not do business with this vendor ever again and would NOT recommend their product.,0
Never received item. Money is gone!,0
I needed the Catholic Bible I had gotten this one accidentally and They charged me for the return. Shame on them. It's the Holy Bible!,0
This pot should be taken of the market immediately!!! You are guaranteed to get scolded when attempting to pour a cup of tea. The so called heat glove gives a false sense of security to the first time users which is why I felt obligated to stress how dangerous this teapot is! Do Not Buy This junk!,0
Ordered for my husband. He hated it. Pillow is way too firm.,0
I waste of my money.,0
Smaller than described- description said AA batteries and it is actually AAA- broke after 2nd use,0
"Value for this product was too good to be true... after using a 2018 15"" MacBook Pro with this, it seems to have overheated and melted. Didn't damage anything else fortunately, and surprisingly didn't blow a fuse, but it was really inconvenient to be quite literally out in the woods on a filming trip with no other way to power my laptop. I'd certainly pay double for a reliable product. I wasn't even using both ports simultaneously, only the USB-C port.",0
Amazon says this filter fits my 2012 Corolla with the 1.8l engine. It does not. Totally too big. Maybe it fits the Camry.,0
I just didn't like the construction,0
These are nothing like the first bunch I bought. They don't stay lit. They barely smolder for more than 30 seconds. You have to stand right on top of them to get any scent!,0
"My dog will not touch this treat. Sniffed it and walked away. Wanted to return but says this item cannot be returned. One bag opened and didn‚Äôt eat one, other bag unopened and no return. Will not buy treats from Amazon in the future!",0
"what a waste, i put hot liquids( coffee) an hour or two is just warm, and before my shift is over is just room temperature, not a good one",0
"GARBAGE!, JUNK!, WASTE OF MONEY! DOES NOT STICK AND YOU HAVE TO PRESS EXTREMELY HARD TO GET IT TO TYPE",0
Wouldn‚Äôt buy this. Half of the chargers in the 5 pack don‚Äôt work.,0
This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable.,0
Work for literally 2 days and then the screen turn black and never turn on again,0
"The protector it's too small!!!! is too narrow for the Honor 6X, it doesn't cover the whole screen!",0
After one week color started to fade and the snap began to peel .wish I never bought it,0
These socks are high quality but way too small!!,0
"Two cameras got stuck on night vision after only 2 weeks. Can‚Äôt return because they are used, plus we need something up!",0
"Ordered a 4 pack, waited almost 2 weeks for delivery. And then was sent the wrong item. Will be returning",0
"the fan stop working after almost a month of using it, tried to change the fuse it still doesn't work, my 10 dollar plastic fans are still running overpriced piece of shit!",0
Had to buy different filters because these wouldnt work with CV carbs,0
"I smelled something burning, then realized this thing was shooting sparks. It had burnt and melted some of its components. Could have started the ceiling or wall on fire, it was shooting sparks pretty far. Totally broken now",0
"This is by far the more worthless piece of junk I have purchased for my pool. I spent an hour attempting to vacuum my pool. I finally gave up and packed it back up. A lot of times I don't pay much mind to negative reviews. But the negative reviews on this item are spot on! Every time I got it working correctly and vacuuming decent, it would just fall apart in the middle of the pool and dump everything back out! Come on Intex, you can do better! How about putting some sort of clamp on to keep it from coming apart! I may be a good product if it wasn't so poorly designed!",0
They never were delivered. Amazon refunded my money.,0
Bought this in silver and black to try to make my hair softer and smoother. Cheap price too good to be true! Feels like very obvious fake silk. Returned immediately.,0
They work great. Too great. My houseplants are drowning. There is no way to control the amount of water that syphon's into the pots.,0
Love the necklace. One of my favorites. But it broke shortly after receiving it :(,0
zipper broke off after 1st use. Poor quality.,0
This bag got some water on it and the black ink/dye on the soccer ball started to bleed. This is unfortunate because I loved the item and was excited to use it for my toddler's food for our day trips. I cannot use this bag anymore as I am worried that dye will get on my child. I had black dye on my hands after touching it and it took a couple of days to rub off.,0
This thing is a piece of crap and started falling apart a day after I put it on the phone. I'll find a better one at the dollar store.,0
The power stake stopped working after about 2 weeks. I wrote and a nice person from Dewenwils emailed me right away and said they would send another and to verify my address. I have not received a new one and have written back several times. The do not respond. I need someone to rectify this or refund me. Please help!,0
One works sometimes and the other one doesn‚Äôt work at all. Very disappointed. I bought these because my cat chews through regular cables. But I guess this won‚Äôt work either.,0
Following thier sizing instructions and they don't come close to fitting properly.,0
It‚Äôs a great idea and felt wonderful but the glove had torn already and I haven‚Äôt played more them. Few rounds and daily range practice with it I very disappointed,0
Not good at all. Only worked the first week i only drink it 2x a day. After 1 week it started to give me constipation. I wanted a refund.,0
the first pill about 2 hours latter i got a headache ...so i thought maybe i was getting a headache anyway after 3 in a row ...well it doesn't work for me !!!,0
"I bought this so I could read outside. But too often when I swipe or click the ""next page"" button, I'm forwarded to some unknown destination in the book pages or even chapters ahead of where I was reading. Good luck finding where you were at because you have no idea how far in advance it forwarded you. It's so frustrating, I almost never use it.",0
Dead on arrival... tried their batteries and our batteries. Neither worked. (All batteries checked at 1.5V and orientation of batteries was good.) Disappointing...,0
Package came with a missing plate now the the whole case is useless. DO NOT BUY!,0
"Bought two sets of these lights to decorate a balcony with. Despite having both of them charging in the sun all day, they don‚Äôt stay lit for more than two or three hours. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you set them to blinking or leave them on steady; they won‚Äôt last more than a couple hours. Disappointing because they are pretty when they are working, but what‚Äôs the point if they‚Äôre supposed to be on throughout the night? Will be returning these.",0
"Was excited at first. But the first time he went to use it and switch the blades they don‚Äôt want to latch on. He hasn‚Äôt even been able to use it, and no heads will pop on.",0
It has a problem grabbing the cards to shuffle them.,0
"If you are looking to purchase an item from a company that has integrity, please do yourself a favor and stay away. I purchased this item and started the return process within 2 days from receipt. The company claimed that the item was damaged and charged me a little less than $80. The item had only been put together to be broken back down because my dog would not been able to use the item. I would have appreciated, if I had been told the amount went towards animal rescue before being insulted of damaging something and returning it since that is not my character. Do your own full research prior to making a purchase and I am sure you will become knowledgeable through your deep dive in who you are purchasing from. We not only have to be kind to animals but humans as well.",0
Ordered this item for my infant during this cold weather! Item stated it was delivered but I never received. Customer service was not great about replacing item as that‚Äôs what I wanted instead of refund! Not happy with service at all!!!!,0
"If high quality sound is something you require then these ear buds are NOT for you. The ear buds do not hold charge longer than 30 minutes at best. Also, depending on the device you are connecting to, only one ear bud will work at a time. Overall I an not happy with this product and would spend the money and get the expensive ones.",0
"The survivor finale aired last night BUT it is available here on Amazon, even though I purchased the whole season!!!!!!! WHERE IS IT????????",0
"Used this on a sleeper couch with the couch mattress under the blow up mattress and it leaked the second night I used it, wasted my money",0
The chain and such was to bulky and gawdy. The gold looked cheap.,0
This broke apart after the first time we used it!,0
Broken into several pieces and there is no return option.,0
"The wood was split down a wood seam when I got it out of the box and styrofoam. So, expensive, yet cheap.",0
"I bought it while I was I China, so I didn't get to use it right away. The first time I took it out of the box and used it, it didn't last more than 8 mins. I tried charging and that did nothing. I would like to contact the seller and try a new machine, but I can't find their contact info.",0
Don't waste your money. Its a booklet at best.,0
They are very pretty but they are not scented and are not soap. When wet they turn into a slimy glop. Not at all happy. I should've read the reviews better before purchasing.,0
"I bought this for a square five gallon bucket to take hunting with me. The straps were about 1.5 feet to short to strap around it and only came with one extra velcro extension and it was still not long enough with it. From the pictures of it holding large coolers, vacuums, etc i expected it to be fine for what i need. I guess ill have to rig up something else now for my hunting trips.",0
This item simply didn't work well. The grinder is a joke. I wasted $30. Worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. Wish I could return it.,0
Broke the first day my daughter wore them.,0
I have not received it thus far.,0
"Looks like the rating has gone down since I bought it, ah well... The screen protector went on well, but the black border of the protector covers up some of the phone's screen due to it not being big enough! Why are manufacturers adding these black borders if they cover up some of the screen? I didn't buy a nearly full-screen phone to have it covered back up by the protector. Also, I've had a bit of trouble getting the OnePlus to read my fingerprint to sign in since installing it.",0
I found this book to be boring and a complete waste of time. Save your money and attention. Don't buy this book.,0
Not exactly original equipment. Similar but not the same as the originals. Not that pleased. The photo made it look like the original. They were not at all like the originals.,0
"I ordered a horse and they delivered me a mule. The colors on the case were all wrong, nothing like the case in the picture.",0
It is so very thin and see through. Material is cheap and my finger poked right though it. Very disappointed. Won't buy again.,0
"Recent purchase is a cheap look-a-like. I purchased this chair in 2017 and like it so much that i asked my family to buy a 2nd one for me as a birthday gift this year. I sent my family the link from my order 2 years ago and they purchased it for me. But what arrived is not the same chair at all. I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched). The holes for the bolts don't line up causing the new chair to be crooked and putting pressure on the bolts. The cushions are smaller and more square (cheaper looking). The arms, legs, rockers, backrest, and seat are thinner. The vinyl is wrapped looser. The reinforcement under the seat has fewer straps to hold up the seat. Bait And Switch. The product has changed substantially and the company is taking advantage of years of good reviews but delivering a different product. Bait And Switch. Ive reported this to Amazon. As of today, the 5 pics at the top of the listing are of the chair i received 2 years ago. However, lower in the detailed From The Manufacturer section, the more current chair is pictured. It's not easy to notice the differences in those pics, but i'm telling you, the 2 chairs i received are not even close to the same quality.",0
Literally last 1 day. I only put it on him when he is in the house not outside and the thread that holds the ribbon around the bow came out. I will never purchase from here again. Such a simple product yet can't be made with quality.,0
"I am very disappointed with this product. I bought the charging pad to use on my bedside table for overnight charging. But the blue charging light stays on all night, is super bright and distracting. Apparently they don‚Äôt allow returns - like most items I buy on Prime. Cheaply made and not well thought out. I don‚Äôt recommend it for anyone looking for a charging pad.",0
"Could not get these to work for the life of me. Cleaned and prepped the wall, stuck them on there, pressed fully for a while and then let them sit for a day before adding weight. The darn things didn't even last an hour trying to hold up a normal, light-weight broom. They look nicer than some of the other crummy options out there, hence my own purchase, but I learned my lesson the hard way and emphatically recommend that you look for something else, these don't work and now I just have a bunch of wasted plastic. =(",0
The pump does not work.,0
Have never recieved the product. Had zero communication with vendor thats even after I emailed them twice. No way to run a business,0
Product did not charge in sun and plug in doesn‚Äôt work. Never got to fully charge it. To late to return.,0
These suck! Died after maybe 10 uses over the course of 2 months. I gave one star because they wouldn't let me submit zero.,0
"No support at all, don't waste you're money!",0
Expected 100 of each different basic lands as per discription but got 350+ islands and only 56 mountains and 46 Forests... whole wrong description,0
"SAVE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT BUY!!! only one of these cords even worked for me. The others, especially the longer ones don‚Äôt even work. Total waste of money! Won‚Äôt buy again!",0
To cheap. do not feel safe on this bench. puls legs broke and no way to replace do not buy,0
Didn‚Äôt work well with the iPhone didn‚Äôt detect half the touches,0
This is not the same pillow I received in 2016. This new pillow is smaller and much harder.,0
Vary but quality use the helium didn't work on it some of them blow so easy not even used much helium Don't waste your money purchase in this Sh** product,0
Did not keep my neck cool,0
I bought this book but it was never delivered even though it says it was. I'm unable to get my money back from Amazon.,0
Didn't even stick to my phone! Waste of money!,0
"This IS NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED. The photo originally had this entire package including the Wii, remotes, Wii fit, Wii balance board, Wii sports package and Super Mario Bros. I had my husband look at all 8 pictures closely because I wanted to make sure I was buying what was advertised. I placed my order and the picture that showed up in my email was NOTHING like what was advertised. This is the SECOND TIME this has happened!! I passed on other seemingly good offers and chose a slightly higher priced package because it had Amazon Prime next to the price... obviously this means nothing! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!",0
It doesn't sit flat on a smooth glass burner. This means food burns in the middle while being barely warmed around the sides. Very annoyed.,0
I was informed it arrived I got all the other items but not this the hoverboard case was the only thing missing,0
This is the spiciest gum I have ever tried. It burnt my mouth. Have it to a friend and she loved it.,0
I bought this in July 18th 2018 and it is a mess all the stitches are coming out already.. I thought I was the only one but looking at the other reviews . makes me feel they need to refund the money.,0
Two of the four ink cartridges were empty no ink.,0
"I bought this headset some point last year as a backup for my main headset, It worked originally upon me testing it. I recently used it and the mic has a ton of interference. If I could return it I would because it's horrible.",0
Bigger than I expect,0
Very disappointed it was broken when I received it so I had to return it. It was the only thing in the box no wrapping or anything to keep it from braking. The colors where pretty I wish I could have actually used it. Nervous to purchase another one because I don‚Äôt want to have to send that back too.,0
"These cables are junk. After 6 months, all three have failed and will no longer charge our phones. Amazon would not take them back and told us to contact the manufacturer.",0
"These are horrible. Purchased two boxes to replace old strip lights on covered porch. They are very temperamental when you plug two strips into each other. The first package power supply was broken where the nail/screw hole is for attaching too hard surface. Possible previously used. The eye on the power unit, for remote, did not work. It was not a bad remote as the remote worked on second unit. Also plugged second white power box into first set and all worked. The plastic protective covering over wires on power box that plugs into wall was too short and did not cover wires completely. Potential fire hazard. When we opened the second box one roll of lights had exposed wires on it as well. The protective rubber covering had pulled out of the end as well. When we turned them on at night it is a cold color, not warm. When we turned it to white there is no actual white color. It is a light blue that they call white. Would not recommend these lights at all, just purely on potential fire hazards, let alone how temperamental they are.",0
Stopped rotating after 3 weeks...,0
"Very bright and has a ton of modes, but it didn't last long. I bought in January of 2017 and I use it about 5x a week for several hours a day at work, I even use Nitecore batteries and a Nitecore charger. The power button is not user friendly, and now the light only works on 2 brightness levels, no more turbo mode! I've tried fully charged batteries and even some new cr123 Batts, but nothing is helping. Now it won't even turn on until I've held the button down or clicked it 30+ times. I'm pretty sure it bit the dust.",0
DONT.BUY.THESE. We bought them for Halloween AND NONE OF THEM WORKED. 0 out of 100 worked. Waste of money.,0
I thought it would be bigger. It was teeny tiny. Maybe a better description - like the size in inches.,0
"these were VERY tiny, super cheap and the color was smeared, bought as a Christmas present - threw them away.",0
I did exactly what the package said to do and it didn't even dry after 24 hours and everything fell off this is crap dont waste your money,0
"I bought this for a Christmas present, my kids tried to play it and one of the buttons does not work. Very disappointing! It says it is past the return window so I'm out the money I spent. Also I have all boys, so why does it only have one boy and one girl face? They should be reversible and have a boy on one side and girl on the other.",0
Sealing doesn't work!,0
"I am incredibly disappointed. I put this together using a youtube video because the directions are garbage, and for a while it was fine. The box was damaged in shipping so I threw it out. The first time I tried to use the table, it got progressively more unsteady. Something inside of it did not stay together and it got more and more wobbly each time I use it. There is nothing to tighten. In order to return it (for ""free""), I would have had to pay $27 to UPS because there was no suitable box to ship it in. When I contacted amazon about this they did nothing and now I am stuck with this crappy table. The company says that the warranty only covers parts so they can send me new parts (for what?!) but they won't take the table back. Extremely disappointed.",0
"I am so disappointed to have bought this heating pad. Beside it not heating well at all, it stopped working. I tried unplugging it and used other outlets, with no success.. I have used other heating pads that have lasted me for years. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BRAND.",0
"So frustrated with this growth ruler stencil. This is the second stencil I‚Äôve purchased (first one was from a different company) yet both have been marked/measured incorrectly. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought that making a stencil in 1‚Äô increments would be that difficult but apparently it is. This physical stencil measures 1/4‚Äù short of a full foot. So if you line them up back to back, by the time you get to the 6‚Äô mark you are 1.5‚Äù too short. And if you line up the sections with 1/4‚Äù space in between it looks off. (While this wouldn‚Äôt bother me as much if it was just for personal use, I sell finished rulers as part of my business.)",0
Horrible!! Do not waste your money. They will not stay on.,0
I buy Frankincense essential oil from another company for years. I decided to try this cause of a better price. I'm returning it. This is NOT Frankincense and not an essential oil. it's some kind of a foul smelling chemical.,0
The glasses they sent were cheap and not even remotely similar to the styles pictured.,0
Does not give accurate readings at all. Tested it against another machine and it was not close.,0
"Just received this in the mail and was struck as to how poor the quality is and how lack luster the workmanship is. There are numerous tucks and wrinkles along the edge and the seam binding/edging just ends - no finishing where it meets itself. The print job is terrible-while it look like a tortilla at a distance, up close it just looks horribly cheap. OK, so I didn't expect it to be super high quality, but I did expect it to be the advertised 60 inches which was the size I needed for a project. Well, it wasn't even that - it came up 2 inches short. Very sad that it feel so terribly short. It would have been perfect if it had been as advertised. I am returning it.",0
"Very low suction, hardly pick anything from the floor.",0
this item is very poor made. the USB port i would have to wiggle it to get it work randomly. but once i do the power isn't consistent.,0
"Shit product, does not work. Messy and a comic, just get regular seed.",0
"Was happy to receive it and put lots of effort putting it up... looks great initially, however the bulbs on three strings burnt out after only two days (was on only for a few hours). This happened without any reason. Just showed the poor quality of the bulbs and it‚Äôs non-repairable! Very disappointed!",0
Product came damaged :(,0
"Product does not work, iPhone keeps saying that accessory is not compatible with iPhone.",0
I ordered a medium but when I received the item the sweater was to small to fit my Yorkie so I returned it then ordered a large it was still to small to fit my Yorkie it was also very cheaply made in China.,0
Leaked from day one. This one is going back.,0
Cracked within a day,0
Apparently you need some other part to make this work. Returned. Logitech mouse is far easier and better price.,0
Product came in with the zipper broken. Emailed seller and NEVER GOT A RESPONSE!!!!,0
Buy Spectra original parts. The backflow protectors pop off constantly. And the Spectra pumping bottles don't secure to the flanges at all. They don't provide a tight fit. These are not at all worth it. Buy Spectra brand.,0
"Not only did it leak as others have noted, but when I tried to open it, the rivets popped out! Been using other pans for years - never happened before. Complete waste of money. Had to trash it after one use.",0
"Very fake, not fresh flavor. No one in my family or neighborhood would eat it at our block party.",0
The bag exploded in the packaging so I never got to use it,0
I ordered brown and red ones. They sent me melted brown ones.,0
I am not satisfied with my order and also the return policy is so weird it‚Äôs been almost a month that I have a problem with my return they haven‚Äôt refund my money back even we returned back the item so still I am waiting for my refund,0
"I recieved the package already opened, and used. I paid full price for a full container, new, but recieved a used product.",0
Never arrived. No refund.,0
The charge will not stay working. After about 10 seconds it stops charging,0
"There is NO way this ""toy like"" zapper handle an area greater than one square foot. Look further! Don't want d technology your money on this zapper.",0
"This item came missing the screws that were required to put the drawers together. I had to buy them separated at a hardware store when they should have been in the package. Furthermore, the wood on one side of the nightstand was bent so the nightstand wobbled and I had to get an added support for it. Finally, when I tried to contact their support about it, the page was deactivated so there was no way to get help with this issue. They look nice when finally put together but the lack of customer support combined with the missing parts and the bent wood lead me to the conclusion that this is a low quality product and I would not buy from this company again.",0
It has a metal core. Only the arms and legs stretch.,0
You will need 3 women with sharp nails to get the film off the adhesive part !!! Its a MESS !!,0
Item didn't even turn on after charging.Door to dvd holder seemed weak.,0
this never showed up,0
This item was cheap & I should have been suspicious. It doesn‚Äôt use USA batteries. You have to order rechargeable batteries & charger from China. $20 more & didn‚Äôt ship for a month. No thanks. I‚Äôm returning it.,0
The tie was not with the robe,0
I love this tea it's my favorite the taste is amazing. But I just opened my frist box the other day and half the box had a hole in the tea bag. This tea ain't cheap üòî,0
Never got it or an explanation...,0
"I had to rent another Modem after having this one connected for just a few months. Buy the latest model recommended by the carrier. We have Xfinity and I was told this model is excellent, but the wifi never worked well; either it was too old a model or really had a defect, I will never know. I bought it refurbished.",0
"I bought this product for my mom. She loved it!! She swear its the best thing beside sliced bread.... After 4 months this product no longer works!!!!!! Please dont purchase any electrical products from Amazon. I tried contacting the Seller, no response. The products was only used a couple of times!!! Money thrown away.",0
This screen protector does not fit the S7 Edge properly even though it was advertised for the edge.,0
I don‚Äôt know how this item is because I never RECEIVED IT!! I haven‚Äôt received anything that I ordered except the silk pajamas and the trench coat and the sexual toys. And I‚Äôm guessing cause they were placed in my mailbox!! I haven‚Äôt received my scooter nor the car!! I want my money back I don‚Äôt even want a delivery anymore!!,0
"I bought a six pack of this product, but three of them were a different kind of deodorant I don‚Äôt use.",0
"You would expect it will last longer than 1.5 years when you paid $600+ for a camera. Mine prompted ""Camera Error Turn Power Off Then On"" in the middle of vacation and never recover and Sony wants me to pay $200+ to send it for diagnostic minus the parts & labor. Looks like I will never buy Sony ever again and I will make sure all my friends & families stay out of SONY. Stay away or you might have to buy extended warranty for this crappy product.",0
Not sure what happened to my steampunk but this is all I got in the bag,0
"The item arrived wet inside the plastic bag in which it was wrapped (obviously used and not new as described), and it had pieces of human hair inside the tray on which the coffee mug sits. I have yet to test the product to see if it works.",0
The battery doesn‚Äôt fit into the device. It won‚Äôt work !,0
The table got here damage with no instructions and i asked to get my money back they still asking to only give 30 or 60% of my money then when I decided to ask them for only the broken piece being refund they said was sending never got here and they always have a excuse to don't do . Very bad costume service . Now after almost month I have the return label and I need to find a box to send back. Never happen to me at Amazon I don't recommend,0
"I was really looking forward to having a ski mask for cold days. However, this is not what I was looking for. The material between the eyes is so thin that I feel like it's held together by 1 or 2 strands. I'm guessing I would have ripped it immediately had I not been careful putting it on. The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth. It would be so simple to slightly widen the strip between the eyes, and maybe use less fabric on the sides of the mouth. So far I have yet to find a decent black ski mask on Amazon - pass this one up if you're looking for quality.",0
I bought the product twice and both times within 5 minutes the piece broke in half with part of it stuck in door!,0
Didn‚Äôt get product in a tub like it shows... it was 2 seal bags and it didn‚Äôt look the same,0
Not at all comfortable rides up,0
"seems good time will tell. UPDATE. gone off twice, that's ok. but couldn't reset by button or turn off. Had to remove back panel and screw, unhook negative side of battery. A real pain. Buy an APC.",0
I had high hopes for this. 4 weeks of use and still only pumping 1/2 oz total üò≠ didn‚Äôt work at all.,0
I ordered this in June and was meant to receive it in August. The carriers say they delivered it but I haven‚Äôt seen it. Contacted the seller via email and I have received no response. That‚Äôs not good customer service. I just sent them another mail. I bought this cos of the excellent reviews I saw here. Not impressed with this one bit.,0
"It was not what I was looking, it was not the Pittsburgh Steelers own app.",0
"Do not read the old reviews that rave this product. The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.",0
"This thing doesn't fit over a standard US faucet aerator, which probably accounts for more than half of all the customers that are trying to use this. If I could give this product a zero I would. Not only is it not universal, but it fails to meet the most common need of its potential users.",0
It didn't fit my phone,0
"It didn‚Äôt last one winter. It tore, and was brittle by spring.",0
It was great for about 3 days and then it broke. Stick with name brands.,0
"Dont believe all the FAKE REVIEWS its a waste of time I tried them all, the only way to stop all the wrinkles and sheets coming out from the sides is by attaching the long straps that go horizontally and vertically from one end to the other end, these corner straps are a joke, you still wake up uncomfortable with wrinkles all over cause the sheets have no pull where its needed and that is in the center.",0
This film was so slow and uneventful it deserves to be listed only as a lullaby! The acting was brutally amateurish and the script was something a four year old would write. The other reviews that are anything above a two star are obviously from people associated with its production. Don't waste your time.,0
"I love these, but #12 and #13 arrived broken. Didn‚Äôt realize and now I‚Äôm less than 2 weeks til my wedding and will have to spend more money on new ones. If I could receive new ones of those numbers I would be satisfied with that but I don‚Äôt see a way to contact the seller, which is disappointing.",0
It worked for like half a song.,0
"First use on July 3, 2018 in readiness for Fourth of July get together. September 3, 2018 it stopped working. Replaced batteries and it won't work. The blue light indicates when powered On, however, the light won't stay lit. It will flash when On/Off button pressed, otherwise no light, no operation. The unit needs a redesign so moisture or soap doesn't leak into the battery compartment corroding the connections. It's very attractive, but useless if it doesn't do anything. :(",0
For the price the glue wasn‚Äôt every strong very disappointed.,0
This is not what I order it looks like for a puppy deceiving they are not big it‚Äôs like 3 inches and they are not think,0
I bought 3 as stocking stuffers for my family for Christmas and a well or two later it stopped working. Very disappointing. I was hoping it would be great for the kids to use while multitasking but unfortunately I was wrong,0
Gets knotted quickly. Doesn‚Äôt look like the picture at all.,0
"Material seems to be good, but came apart after a few uses.",0
"Materials are cheap and see through. Held together by a light stitch, so easily comes apart. I wish I wouldve saved my money. Bought this for my Florida honeymoon and it just hangs in my closet. Eventually I will send it to the Salvation Army.",0
Not the full length of your eyelid,0
I order lot‚Äôs of stuff from Amazon and this one just slipped my mind. Ordered these Cones about 3 months ago. Item showed delivered but I never received them. It‚Äôs too late to make a claim with Amazon so I lost the $12 I paid for them plus I didn‚Äôt get the cones.,0
failed after six months . Warranty replacement is impossible so far !,0
The socks run extremely small and are so tight that they are difficult to get on. The MED socks (chose based on size chart) are tight on a woman's 7 1/2 shoe size foot and much too small for a man's 9 shoe size foot.,0
Did absolutely nothing for me at all,0
I ordered the over 6 weeks ago and I still don't have it,0
not at all what was advertised,0
I didn‚Äôt want to write a review cause I‚Äôm giving time to see if is working or not.,0
"Wrong item sent! As w/ other reviewers, I ordered 4 brush heads but got 3 brush heads +cleanser! Seller posted 4 week‚Äôs ago that they had corrected problem & correct item would be sent in the future....well problem is NOT FIXED",0
I bought it for my mother's Walker it will not stay on and falls off cell is very uncooperative would not recommend them,0
For one the cap over heats. How can u hold some to your Vagina that over heats. Secondly I can‚Äôt turn it off it says 2-3 seconds and it goes off but it doesn‚Äôt. My last complaint is that the vibrations are too soft. Unless the one I received is broken or the button don‚Äôt work it doesn‚Äôt change speed. Highly disappointed,0
It us too hard to get the fruit infuser out of the bottle.,0
"The design is lovely, but it is crudely made. The bottom is very thin and badly deformed. Very disappointed.",0
The bras were so cheaply made. Had to return them,0
I didn‚Äôt buy this???,0
1 is not good to use.There is no sound insulation.And it's very expensive.It still doesn't work if you try to place a different position.,0
It is a great size for a 2 or 3 year old but the zipper came apart after just 2 uses. This is one of the things I dislike about amazon..... I ordered this ahead of time for our trip... And now that the trip has arrived and we only now find out that the zipper is broken there's nothing I can do about it to get return to replaced since I Ordered it ahead of time in preparation.,0
Only for extremely small suvs. It was way to small for my Ford Edge.,0
These markers are either fake or used. Very disappointed with this product.,0
"Absolute junk. Do not buy this scope, the internals are complete junk.",0
hose too small for water pressure. Blew out my water line.,0
"One of 3 batteries came broken. The company wants us to mail it back that in it's broken condition. Guess what, FedEx or UPS won't ship a broken battery as it's forbidden cargo. This company tanks high on the worst customer service. Stear clear of first web sales. You've been warned.",0
"NEVER RECEIVED, seller will not reply....still states in transit!",0
I ordered according to their size chart; there is no compression at all. You also cannot return them.,0
"I don't like writing bad reviews. This case is HORRIBLE. The magnets will not snap into my tablet. Even if they did, the design is poor. It's difficult to use for any function one might want to use it for... reading, video watching, web surfing etc. I'm returning it immediately!",0
Quality of the sunglasses don‚Äôt match up with the price. The lens looks flimsy and the frame is uneven.,0
This does not do its job what so ever. It does not collect lint or hair.,0
first of all there no strecth to the leggings and on top of that they are see thru they fit weird and are not comfty i return them dont waste your money on these,0
"Cute bottle, horrible product",0
trash!!! not working ... don't loose your money.,0
"The shirt is NOT long at all. It does not fit like the advertised photo at all. The color is correct, that‚Äôs about it. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7, 145 and ordered a large hoping it would be longer.. it is very wide and comes to my belt buckle. If I lift my arms my stomach will show.",0
Ordered in black and very disappointed to open it and it was red,0
"I used these once and then threw them away. The first problem was that they didn't work (they didn't absorb sweat at all). Then when I washed them in the washing machine, they practically fell apart. These had good reviews, so I was optimistic and bought 2 pair instead of trying out with just one first. That was a mistake. I would not order these again. At all.",0
I am soooooooo freaking disappointed in this costume!!! I bought it for my daughters first Halloween size 6-12 months the sizing that‚Äôs on the one I received is 6months to 2 years old!!! Like how in the heck is something that‚Äôll fit a 6 month old supposed to fit a 2 year old!! Its huge on my 9 month old!! It‚Äôs not at all what is pictured or what others have posted pictures of. It‚Äôs like I got sent a knock off!!!! I‚Äôm so upset. Halloween is tomorrow if I could I would send it back but she‚Äôll have to wear it since it‚Äôs to late to find another option!! DO NOT BUY THIS KNOCK OFF!!!!,0
"worked 1year at most, then you throw it away",0
"I bought the steak and chicken for my Brussels Griffon, she tried one of each and she will not eat them again. She doesn‚Äôt like them. They really have no smell to them and they look dry and hard. Wasted my money. She does love her dental bone from Wilderness. She gets one every morning. Now... it looks like a real bone.",0
Made from low quality materials. Very disappointed.,0
"Worked fine for short uses but fell asleep with the fan on and now it no longer works only the light. Very upsetting, I‚Äôve had it only a few weeks too",0
Loved the look of these hand towels but after a few washes the seems are coming out. They are now garage rags. Disappointing!!!,0
"I can not recommend this chair. I am on my 3rd set of casters, and finally figured out what the problem is. The holes for the casters to sit in are not set in the same orientation on each of the legs. Meaning that one caster might be leaning out several degrees and an opposite caster might be leaning in several degrees. I can not simply pull the chair in any one direction without weight on the chair, because of this. I am outside of my return window, not to mention the size / cost of returning an item such as this. I definitely can not recommend this product.",0
I have not received this item today,0
Worked horribly. Cut jagged not clean at all and yes I used it correctly. Not happy had to redo vinyl on my hood.,0
It had a broken valve that I fixed but the product itself may have already lost it holding. It does not work,0
"I foster young kittens and let them run around the house freely. Top protect our sofa and beds, I have bought quite a few similar pads, true 100% cotton, in all sizes, from some on-line shop that specializing in items of such, for hospitals and nursing homes. They worked well. I have some that are way over 5 years and still soft to the touch and serve the purpose well. I wash and bleach them constantly to keep the smell off. But they are much more expensive compared to these ! However, when the first ""accident"" by kitten occurred on this one, I could see a pool of water standing in the middle of the pad, not being absorbed at all! when I went to pick it up, I noticed the liquid moving around like water in a plastic plate ! In fact, after carefully folding it up, a few drops of liquid did run out and wet the sofa ! And this was only one ""small"" mess ! what a mess ! Cheaper to buy a tarp ! I now put it by the entrance doors on raining days for people to leave their wet shoes on !",0
"Bought this thinking that it would work based off of the reviews. Starting clogging up on me. Unfortunately, it's passed the window to return. I should've bought a Bissell.",0
"I ordered a small, outside package says small. But the inside product clearly says xs.",0
Too bad you can‚Äôt give them zero stars. All of them don‚Äôt work anymore and I have only used each one about 4 times. They are horrible and break fast. Do not buy.,0
Not happy at all. False advertisement. Only plays one song. Does not play fully through. No mint bow. Not at all what is described.,0
I have called back the same day i received it and got a return shipment and today I am still waiting to pick this up to get my return..,0
Received wrong color,0
Stated that the length was approximately 24 inches. It's nowhere near 24 inches.,0
Very cheap considering the price. It broke in less than a day.. I recommend not to even waste your money on this.,0
Honestly for what i paid i expected a better radio....very disappointed it sounds like crap and to change radio station it is like the 1990 alarm clocks. u roll it with ur thumb for that and volume. Also there is no base/treble button and its all static,0

"If you're wondering whether these are knock-offs, then remember you get what you pay for. These earbuds look and even feel like the real thing, but their sound quality is so bad it's clear that they're not. In a head-to-head with a pair of known, genuine Apple earbuds, the two pairs look identical, but sound remarkable different. It's clear the emphasis for these earbuds is looking the part but not carrying any respectable sound quality. Mind you, Apple earbuds aren't an audiophiles pick to begin with, but these sound so bad the difference between the genuine and fake buds is so obvious. Unless you're looking to use these exclusively for scratchy audio in phone calls, I'd keep looking.",0
"I ordered the part to fit my Heavy Duty Kitchenaid mixer. However, when it arrived it would not fully attached to the mixer peg. The hole narrowed at the bottom and would not lock into the stand mixer. Would not work so I had to return it.",0
I would like a new bottle this one was open someone Twisted the seal,0
So sure enough after my 90 day return window this speaker won‚Äôt charge anymore. So another defective Bluetooth speaker to add to the mountain of shoddy electronic devices that seem to quit working after a few months. BUYER BEWARE!!,0
The curtain rod keeps falling as the tension does not keep it place.,0
Product didn't seem to either heat or cool...we were not happy with this purchase,0
"I have ordered this many times and the product I received this time was completely different. The color is way off (yellow/cream versus medium/light brown). This time it is greasy and difficult to wash off. Plus, the exfoliating beads are large. Guessing I received a fake product!",0
"Never received my order, took forever to respond to my messages.",0
I think they were not adequate. Much too sunlight got through. Burned a lot.,0
"Disappointing lock quality. One of the keys only works on 3 locks, and the other key on 3 locks. So if you want to be able to open all the locks you have to carry both keys. The lock mechanism seems to be loose in the lock body as well.",0
"Terrible. Didn‚Äôt hold air from the jump. Waited a few days and it still wouldn‚Äôt even hold all the air for more than 10 minutes. And Oh good luck trying to get it back into the Tiny box it comes in if you want to return it ! The box ended up ripping open at the seams, I ended up throwing the whole thing out",0
Material is of very poor quality. Don't worth buying,0
cheap...I thought I was getting a form compressed blue fiber filter...nope..very holey ..I had to buy another kind to trap dirt...these do not trap anything...I'm going to send to my recycle bin,0
Does not fit any of the 5 walkers we have. Will tip forward or back I had to clean up ensure in palce's it should have never been.,0
I ordered a new replacement touch screen digitizer to replace my cracked screen in my Note 10.1. First one came in SHATTERED! Returned it got a second one turns out that was defective also I guess. S Pen works but no finger recognition. NO GOOD!,0
I followed the clean instructions and it still was sticking bad. I‚Äôm totally disappointed.,0

After using the turn signal both strips get stuck on amber color and randomly switch back to white. They worked as intended a few times and then started to get stuck. Waste of time and money,0
Cute but it's really something you can get out of the bubble gum machine necklace broke and I've only had for 2 weeks,0
"these are misleading. if your beam is taller than the spoke provided, there's nothing for these hooks to anchor onto. I ended up getting a screw-in hook and attaching my own carabiners",0
"Purchased this December 2017, and it stopped working January 2018. I would not recommend purchasing this device. The manufacturer doesn't list this item on their official website. Consequently, they don't seem to offer any warranty, or publish warranty information.",0
I love the idea and how easy they were to use But one the clip broke with in hours of using it I was able to replace the hook with one I bought at the store,0
"Awful. Not what was described. Don't look like the picture at all. Maybe 4"" tall tops no arms and no wire in the hat or with the Nordic pattern that was in the description.",0
The white does not work and they sent two of the same color not happy with product,0
It's bland and under done,0
This case is BEAUTIFUL BUT THE BOTTOM PART IS TOOOO HARD and it has broken 2 chargers already.. one piece is now left inside my phone and now I have to PAY to fix it. DO NOT BUY IT. If you decide to buy it anyway.. cut the bottom part. The little cover for your charger.. CUT THAT PART!!,0
Ordered 5 or 6 weeks ago. Never received.,0
"Cheap quality. Stitching came all jagged, and the fabric is very thin.",0
"Bought a set came with a remote, and was not capable of bluetooth. They replaced the box and after being installed it lasted 2 hours. No refund. poor product quality and not worth the money you pay if it never was fully functional from the beginning.",0
This clock kept gaining time do not buy!!,0
Doesn‚Äôt work at all so there was no point in even using it,0
It doesn't even connect to my smartphone! But without smartphone it is absolutely useless.,0
The bottle felt like it Was only 1/4 of the way full when I received it! It also did nothing to help with any pain! Waste of money!,0
Using Bruce willis as a star in this movie suckered me into getting it. He was just window dressing,0
Not able to get it to play and I have purchased it,0
I‚Äôm very disappointed. The bottle is cute but it stopped working after one week. It no longer sprays out water.,0
Not quality I‚Äôve purchase before,0
I like the color but its so cheep the moment I pulled it out it broke.,0
"these tools are almost unusable. There are tiny allen head set screws that hold the cutters in the handle they striped out the first time I slightly tightened them. That's not all, every thing in this cute little box are just toys. I'm new to leather work but I've been a master carpenter since 1980. I know how to use tools, but these are really of poor quality. If you want to get into leather working spend a little more and buy better quality, otherwise you might be discouraged by the sad results these tools produce.",0
Won't come out of tube wouldn't stick to face very well either,0
"There were holes in the seam of the rear end of these leggings and you can‚Äôt return them. Wish I realized there was no returns, shame on me for not looking and shame on them for not offering",0
I bought this for my craftsman trimmer which is listed in the product description. Changed carb and it didnt work. Spent some time trying to adjust high and low but nothing worked. Do not buy.,0
"We tried two tv's from this company and both had to be returned with in a few days. First we ordered the 22in and the sound went out completely 30 minutes into a movie. We returned that and ordered the 24in with a sound bar. This time we made it through one movie and a couple days later we turned it on to find no sound at all, again! Now we are returning a second and will NOT be purchasing from this company again.",0
I got a defective one,0
Not even one year later and none of the cords are working.,0
Doesnt work. I think it actually attracts the fleas to the collar as I have had it on my cats for three days and no dead fleas. Losts of the fleas were near the collar. Frustrated as this did not work,0
Shipped wrong item.... But I was refunded all cost,0
"It absolutely did not fit my son's S5. They are quick to send a replacement, but now I have sent both cases back, and I have not received a replacement. I cannot figure out how to get a hold of anyone.",0
The seller had asked me to post pictures of the damaged item.,0
"I didn't like how these fit my daughter. She simply bend down to pet our dog, and split right in the crotch within an hour of opening them.",0
This spray is either outdated or fake. It irritated my skin which turned bright red which never happens with the store bought version of this. Please see attached photo of store bought versus ordered on amazon. Buyer beware!,0
Description says it's ultrasonic. It is not. If you want an ultrasonic whistle do not buy.,0
Ruined and dried out my hair. Brought into my salon and different color and smell. Don't buy.,0
These hide-a-lines are absolute garbage. The plastic is cheap it flakes off as you attempt to attach them together. The screws strip out every time you attempt to use them. This product made a rough job even harder. I wish I had time to return them but I have to continue using them...,0
I guess I misread the description because I saw that it was 2 baskets. I was shocked when only one arrived. I would never have paid $45 for 1 basket. I chose this because I am disabled and I thought that this basket would make laundry day easier. I can't return it because there is no way I can haul around the huge box it came in. I feel stuck with it and angry that you charge $45 for 1 laundry basket.,0
"I was so excited about this...arrived packed well and then it broke in two seperate very important places in the first month! I think the plastic its made of us simply low quality, sucks too because its such a huge piece of plastic to be wasting now and it had a cool stabilizer and the feet were solid üôÅ",0
has visible damage to pins.,0
Too small for 1-1/2 year old,0
If I could give this 0 stars I would. It‚Äôs not at all what we ordered. Needed these cupcake rings for my daughters birthday party tomorrow and instead I am left with breast pump and breast milk accessory micro steam bags. Wtf.,0
These are thin and they fall apart would not recommend to anyone,0
I was looking forward to being able to change the color of the light but unfortunately that function is not available. The light was however easy to connect to Alexa and is nice not having to require a hub. Now that I‚Äôve had these a few weeks it really bothers me that they are not as advertised. I thought I would get used to the color but the longer I have them the more it irritates me. I‚Äôm going to have to look for another brand.,0
"This thing is horrible, I thought it was strong, powerful, reliable. The cord seemed strong and it wouldn't crack or break up. Thats not the case, Its just a casing, it can still tangle up from inside, and the volume part in the middle broke off the wire. Absolute garbage, don't buy this non-sense. I should have bought those more expensive head phones with better return policy, im at a loss with this one.",0
"I am on my third UE Boom. I have a background in digital film making and sound editing. I handle my equipment with care. No drops, no spilling, no kicking around. Nevertheless, all of my 3 Ultimate Ears booms lasted only for about 1 year, not even that. They look cool, but always same story: Without any apparent reason, from one day to another, they stop working properly and instead put out tinny, clanking, and weak sound. Sometimes it helps, when Bluetooth gets rebooted. I am done with this brand. Don't know what the quality issues are, given thousands of great reviews. Either, they are selling counterfeits here on Amazon, which I happened to get, or the speakers are really built not to be durable.",0
Never received the item.,0
There was a bunch of top names missing and or spelled wrong,0
Didn't have it ten minutes before it broke. As soon as I tried attaching it to the spigot it snapped in two.,0
The product stopped working after a couple of months.,0
"I am a photographer that depends on batteries to make a living. This is frustrating because the charger seems fairly well designed, but obviously has electrical problems.",0
Never received this item!,0
Love the earrings. But the left earring was bent. I am worried that it will break after putting it on after awhile.,0
"Awful, awful material. Polyester. Feels TERRIBLE to the touch. Had to throw them away. I would not recommend these to my enemy. I know I have already said awful but I will again just in case you didn't completely get it: they're AWFUL.",0
I bought two of these and NEITHER of them worked. I have a ball python that has a heat mat under his terrarium that works perfectly. I plugged both in programmed it to my desired temperature and left it in for a 24 hour period. The heat in the terrarium never got about 72 degrees F. This is extremely upsetting as I said neither of the two worked and my return window has already closed so I‚Äôm stuck with $50 worth of useless heat controllers.,0
"It was super baggy in all the wrong places... oddly not too big, just bagged so much that it didn't effectively cover all of the parts that should be covered. I guess you get what you pay for :/",0
Been using a few weeks now and no changes,0
"I was so excited to find a curl release round brush blow dryer/styler. I immediately tried it because my hair happened to be damp when it arrived. It tangled my hair 3 out of 4 times. My hair got caught in the brush so badly that I was seriously concerned I would have to cut it out. I have used these type of stylers numerous times and I am 53 years old, it is not human error. The rubber grips the hair and the release feature is ineffective. The company does not accept returns but Amazon offered amazing service!",0
Makes my super sensitive skin chemical burn even when following the directions to a T. Only used once then had to recover for 2 weeks from some sort of skin burn reaction.,0
"My son has been loved the product, however we have not owned it for two months yet, and the clip has broken. Very cheap. Very irritated. Amazon should send a new one.",0
Blows very mild air at first then eventually stopped working effectively. Money wasted.,0
"Computer stopped working after plugging this in. As soon as I plugged it in and booted, my PC when into a disk failed state. Uninstalling did not fix this. Took me 2 hours of diagnosis and disk repair to get my computer working again.",0
"Item arrived in box with no padding. The part of the case that connects to the hose was broken off. Returned item, still waiting for refund.",0
"A nice paperback, like most Penguin Classics, however my copy had a large tear across almost the entire back cover. I would return it, except that I need the book immediately and don‚Äôt have time to wait. A partial refund would be nice.",0
I bought this product hoping that the other reviews about this product cracking and not removing hair were wrong. Well this product cracks if the layer applied is not SUPER thick. Even if applied generously it still cracked and caused a bigger hassle to remove. Needless to say I returned this product.,0
"Wtf it‚Äôs just an empty box...I thought gag gift meant that it was just a stupid gift, not that there isn‚Äôt any gift at all",0
This movie is dreadful. I usually don't write reviews after watching movies but this one inspired me to hopefully deter anyone wanting to watch it from wasting their time. No stars!,0
The numbers were very hard for the kids to read. (It needs to have a different font) I would not buy it again.,0
Loved the look of this but it was too tall so I had to send it back,0
Doesn't work like they say on TV,0
I wanted this to work so bad because of the price but sadly it did not. I started using it on August 5th and have been using it every single day. I dont see no new growth at all. It was a waste of money for me.,0
One of the corner reinforcements and grommet fell off when we unfolded the tarp. Company gave us a full refund.,0
It will NOT boot up. I bought insurance from Amazon.. For crying out loud. I think it is hopeless.,0
It wouldn‚Äôt seal on the outer edge of my iPhone7 so I took it off and threw it away.,0
"Junk, after less than 2 months it freezes up to where the only thing the standby button ( which controls most operations ) just dims or brightens the display, a function it's not supposed to do.. Too late to send back..Stay away..",0
I ordered this specifically for the thin red line ring. The original order did not have the red but two of the silver lines. I called amazon to get it fixed. They sent the same exact item with no thin red line ring. Called Amazon again and they couldn‚Äôt figure out a solution.,0
"Very upset , attempted to use for my baby shower and they came slashed. Never buying again.",0
"Bought this as a Christmas present and the remote did not work with the droid, was sent a second one and it had the same issue. I do not recommend this to anyone.",0
"Not what I ordered. What I received was not even a backpack, more like a lunchbox duffle bag. Can't use it for everyday use as needed so I am returning.",0
Neither cord works after the first charger,0
It not like the picture in person it looks like a regular tshirt.,0
Don‚Äôt but. This is very uncomfortable and it was in the garbage can by the end of the day. The fabric had a butch of small perforated holes (it is the style) and the skin would ‚Äútry to leak out‚Äù of it making it super uncomfortable within the hour.,0
Quality is okay but there not 5 yards long!,0
I never received the items,0
"Worst set of tools I have purchased from Amazon. For $13, I expected a lot better quality. The 0.8mm pin was out of the holder. I had to fix this with a vice before it was usable. The other 3 pins where bent. If you don‚Äôt want to fix these tools before you can use them, buy something else. I bought an other set for half this price from Amazon and they are a lot better. No way would I give this as a gift.",0
I guess I‚Äôll be lucky to get one Christmas out of the tree. I didn‚Äôt plan on it being disposed after one use,0
"Very thin, size small the arms are short.",0
They still have yet to arrive. Super disappointed because I needed for a project.,0
I bought three of them and 2 of them broken already.,0
Product arrived stale and chewy. Should be crunchy. Old. I had to throw away.,0
"I've tried this thing for a few days and I'm shocked. First night there were none. The second day I checked periodically and saw 3 stuck on it. Ok cool. The next time I checked they were all gone.... wait what?! Then I watched one of these tricky little creeps get stuck upsidedown, do a back bridge out of the stickiness until he flipped over on his legs and JUMPED OFF THE STICKY PAD! I'm flabbergasted. Useless. Make your pads stickier! And yes I removed the film.",0
"First of all, there are NOT 24 cans - there are only 8. Secondly, the paints do NOT glow in the dark, even after leaving them in the sun for days. Waste of money. Don't bother.",0
Lasted 3 months. Cheap ceramic spacers cracked causing coil to short to case. DO NOT BUY!,0
"Within 1 year, was leaking, gaping holes.",0
"Zippers are horrible. The bags were ok. The pouches zippers are better but I am treating them with extra TLC. I threw out the packing bags right in the hotel. The zippers were off the track right upon delivery. I fixed them but they do not zip smoothly. Too much trouble. Very annoying because when you‚Äôre in the road for six weeks, you want to be organized.",0
"It took two months for the package to arrive, when I finally got it the succulent was almost completely dead. Hopefully I can get it to survive once I plant it.",0
Package arrived EMPTY!!!,0
I don't normally write reviews but this was bad. As soon as I opened the bag it smelled terrible. Once I held the toothbrush it caused me to gag. It smelled as if it had been dead for 2 weeks. I am not even joking. Tried boiling it for 10 min with no success. There is no way I would give this to my dog. It smells much worse.,0
It sheds like crazy... I don‚Äôt know about other people. But It is definitely too rough on my skin.,0
It arrived in bad condition! It was bent in many places. Very unhappy,0
This product worked ok when I first got it but there was always feed back. I‚Äôve had it 2 months now and it no longer works at all. Waste of money.,0
"Disappointed!! I loved the colors -so pretty. But as others reviewed, the product is smelly, sticks, dries like glue with burning sensation on lips. Don‚Äôt buy and if used, coconut oil is your rescue!!!",0
"Fits well and of decent quality, but seems highly unlikely to be OEM as the item title states. It ships with black tape covering samsung and s6. I'm not sure if i didn't get any adhesive with mine, or its supposed to already be applied to the piece but it didn't stick very well. The tool is ok, but you will need a heat source to get the glue to weaken enough to get the glass started coming off. Mine was shattered so pieces of glass kept breaking off trying to get underneath it, but once it started it came off pretty easily. After having this installed a few months, its cracked in multiple places and glass is falling off. Whatever it's made of breaks easily.likely won't be a very long term fix for a busted case.",0
They sent me wrong item.,0
I never write reviews but I just had to in this case. I bought this over a month ago for a birthday gift. Friend opened it yesterday and it appears that the bottle was damaged or defective because 1/3 of the perfume leaked out and stained all the tissue paper and carton. Very embarrassed to give such a gift.,0
"My mother taught me that if you can‚Äôt say anything nice, don‚Äôt say anything at all!",0
2001 dodge dakota. Installed fine but not bright at all. Pretty well useless.,0
Does not hold air. Have to inflate every use,0
These cords do not fit Android phones and are too fat for Apple. Basically the are useless. Product cost 10 bucks and the return fee is 6 bucks. Not worth the trouble of returning. Just don't buy.,0
This product looks nice in the picture but is very cheap looking in person. The candle was even junky plastic. It's way overpriced for a low quality product.,0
This product is absolutely bullshit. You can not even grab a cookie sheet out of the oven that has been baking at 350 degrees without getting burned. You could pretty much put on a pair of winter gloves and be better off. A complete and utter waste of money. Extremely disappointing! The description states 932 degrees F????!!!!,0
"I ordered the solid blue and received a blue with gray cuffs and bottom band. I really don‚Äôt like the look. It took forever to arrive and is not worth the hassle to return, so it‚Äôs going straight to the giveaway bin.",0
This really works makes you Eat less. Drink lots of water with it.,0
Couldn't get it to work. Maybe I didn't understand the rules correctly. Never played before. Deleted,0
"I needed a new mouse, did my research and decided this mouse was perfect....until it stopped working after 3 months. I was very disappointed and unfortunately couldn‚Äôt return it so I‚Äôm stuck with a mouse that doesn‚Äôt work and have to buy another one.",0
This shirt is absolutely terrible & does not look at all like the picture. I should have known better.,0
"Save your money, not long after you pay full unlock the game freezes and you can't go anywhere.should get refund.",0
The scent is way too overpowering.,0
"Product is great, but I ordered 9 of these all came in 9 different bags",0
Took one tiny sip of this chalk and was left drinking half a gallon of water hydrating what I puked out,0
"Does not come with screws to fit, cannot use screws from existing window(to short), cannot purchase the correct screws due to irregular size.",0
"This is poorly made. After 2 uses for international travel, the areas around the wheels on 2 of them cracked making them stand and wheel unevenly which made them a hassle to commute. Cannot be used anymore.",0
"I bought this item with very high hopes. I inoperable the box, use the tap measure function and the metal piece breaks completely off. It then retracted back into the device and is no unusable. The laser light itself should be in a fix position and it‚Äôs difficult to relabel it. The instructions are poorly written and does not cover set up. Avoid this item if possible",0
Tedious to put together.,0
Stopped working after 4 months.,0
I was looking for play rings...but these are unbelievably poorly made. Most gems broke off when unpacking and it‚Äôs like the ring is just a pressed thin tin. Very cheaply made. Do not recommend.,0
This was a waste of money. Wouldn‚Äôt stay on my son‚Äôs wall. We tried multiple times to get this to stick and it would fall down within 30 min.,0
"I was so excited about this dryer and straightener and could not unpackage it fast enough. Took it out, plugged it in and it started smoking and sparking and almost caught my hair on fire. I have never in my life purchased a product that was so dangerous, could have been a lemon but I would never purchase this brand again. Spent a few more dollars on the revlon version and soooo much better and quality is better!!",0
Walmart can ship these in AZ without them melting. To bad Amazon can't.,0
"I was hoping for a really sharp well sharpened saw. the teeth are totally irregularly sharpened, some bent over a little and it just doesn't cut worth shit.",0
"Sending it back. I did not like the quality of the printed birds on it. Looked cheap. So I bought the quilt instead, which was better. Not sure if it's the material that was used for the comforter. Back ground of comforter is also darker than the pictures,",0
"This soccer ball was for my eight year old son. However, I received the wrong size. So it‚Äôs sitting on the counter unused.",0
"All the brightness began to fall immediately, what a shame that they put on sale such a poor quality product",0
I havnt been able to put together product due to no screws plastic locks and wheels,0
"If I could give it a zero I would. It‚Äôs a piece of thin cotton fabric with a string attached. It is cheap, but still a waste of a few dollars. The picture is NOT the product you get.",0
"Bought key chain as a gift. Very pretty, a little too big but it was nice. Felt apart in a week. Would not recommend.",0
"I ordered this for my husband, we have been having trouble conceiving and decided this would be a nice place to begin checking into our fertility. We are anxious to begin and get the results, he does the test 100% direction by direction and the test cake back inconclusive. Nothing read up on the test window. After all of that hassle and paying for the product, it didnt even work. Were both incredibly disappointed.",0
They are super nice but broke as we hung them. Not in one place but all the places,0
"I wish there was a way to make this no stars. I took our 12.5 lb Aussie Doodle puppy, 4 months old, for her first walk on this new leash. WOW! She is teething badly, but I didn't think anything of it. Her previous nylon leash lasted for two months before I wanted to order a new one for her. We got two blocks down from the house and low and behold, she had this thing to almost ripped in apart and she would have taken off!! I had to pick her up and carry her back home! Terrible leash but Amazon was quick as usual to offer a full refund. I am going with a totally different brand and style.",0
"Three cans arrived opened, product had dried out, unable to use.",0
"Pooly packaged, 3 quarts of oil in a thin ziplock bag, shipped in white FedEx bubble envelope. Item appears to have been crushed and blew open oil of the quarts of oil in the bag. The sise seam of the ziplock bag failed. The envelop was partially filled with oil which saturated the contents and left a stain on the porch where it was delivered.",0
"Lets start with my first gripe, something simple, something I can get past. They put a giant sticker on the FRONT of the panel. The sheer purpose of this product is to fill an empty space and display the face of the unit. Now the meat-and-potatoes of this train-wreck of a product, two of the four corners are MANGLED, not slightly bent.... MANGLED. I can get past a used item having such wear-and-tear, but it's new, and the rest of the panel is PRISTINE. The box it was shipped in is in perfect shape, it was even wrapped up inside the box to prevent shifting while in transit, which means whoever packaged this clearly saw the damaged product and said ""screw it, it's fine."" I'm honestly beyond curious how the corners get this destroyed and ships this out as ""new"".",0
I bought one color by mistake that unfortunately will not work on my hair after reading everything on the Pravana website & am unable to return even though the package was never opened. I also bought everything the Pravana website said I would need for my dark hair and followed their instructions EXACTLY and I‚Äôm not even going to show you what the end result was. Needless to say I will NOT use these products ever again!!,0
"Everytime it was connected to '03 rx300 to reset airbag light, this equipment triggered 2 new traction lights TRAC OFF and VSC, and could not reset them !!!",0
Arrived with the cap off and soap all over the product and inside its packaging. Don't know how much was wasted because of the leaking.,0
"Vacuum in hair clipper is genius. But the quality needs work. I used it three times in four weeks. After the third use, the clipper started to turn on and off by itself. It was like a ghost had taken over the item. Not sure if I got the lucky defective item or if the overall quality needs improvement. Luckily, it was three days before end of return period. Anyway - I think I would have loved this hair clipper. But I am not willing to spend $50-60 to test something with potentially minimal lifespan. Also - this just went up from when I bought it at $50 by 16%. If this lasted potentially 2+ years I might give it another try. But otherwise - $50 for a month of use is pretty steep.",0
One of the bottles of polish broke during shipping. It's not salvageable - glass is glued to the plastic packaging by the dried up polish. The bottle that broke was the specific color that I ordered this kit to use. There are no returns on this product so that's unfortunate.,0
Not a good buy! Only Bright with the Charger in.,0
Movie was a waste of time for me. Thank goodness for fast foward.,0
"It is unusable. I put it in a drawer. someday, my heirs will be cleaning out this drawer and wonder what the heck I was thinking, and also what the heck it is.",0
All three quit working less than a week of having. I didn‚Äôt bother returning...just tossed,0
Would like to give a zero. Can‚Äôt use it on my Nintendo switch,0
"This reads like a first draft. 1. The characters are static, 2. The villains' motivations are not well thought out, 3. The setting is somehow both bland and overdone, 4. The pacing is rushed towards the end. It feels like the author got tired of writing and just slapped together an ending. This is the second book ever that I will take the time to completely remove from my Amazon account, not just delete from my device.",0
Not impressed. I didn't notice a difference. A really expensive attempt. But I'm glad we gave it a try.,0
Id put zero stars if I could. Every one of the balloons pooped before we used them. I had them in little pools with water and filled them up and they werent just deflated but actually popped before the kids came out to play. Dont waste your money.,0
Broke within few days.,0
"So disappointed with Amazon! I ordered this Bug Joe chair for my daughters dorm room, all my daughter received was a plain plastic bag of refill beans! Call to fix it and found out the item is no longer in stock. I did get a refund but still really dissappinted.",0
I can't believe this movie got so many good ratings. What a waste of my time.,0
Started and idled fine but runs out out of fuel when put under load.,0
I failed to read all the reviews. These are too wide to put on a breadboard and use all the pins. The NodeMCU are way better.,0
I would like to review this item unfortunately it NEVER arrived!,0
"I would love to write a review, however, I never received my order.",0
"This item is a waste of money, it suppose to charge your phone fast but it literally take 25 min for it o go up 1%. I‚Äôve tested it and was wanting to make a video to send to seller. Don‚Äôt get this, invest in a better charger.",0
Scent does not last!! You spray and the smell is gone :(,0
"I like the construction, feels like it will hold up well. Tires are nice. However 5 feet into reeling up my hose for the first time the crank stripped out the threads where it attaches to the spool. I'll fix it by drilling through where it screwed on and threading a bolt through easily enough but it's something to be aware of.",0
This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money.,0
Not cut to screen size of OnePlus 6. A bit smaller on the width and height. Will have to return.,0
"I bought these for my business to organize client keys. I don‚Äôt trust these will hold up. The plastic is so thin where the metal ring attaches. It could break off and loose the key. It's a good price and I like the organization. You get what you pay for. Update: As I suspected, a key broke off! I kept it tucked in my pocket in case that would happen. The key was safe. That could have been bad!",0
Did not receive product,0
Still no pickup of the item for return,0
"Very disappointed. Worked at first. Now, after three months does not work. Cannot recommend.",0
It does not work iPhone 8 Plus I would like to have a return label you sent it back,0
These are a slippery nightmare. Just abt broke every bone falling with this things. JUNK!,0
The rails on this product easily detaches. It looks cheap and the spacing between the top and bottom racks are too tight making shoes clash.,0
I wanted to like this so bad. There were more good reviews than bad so I gave it a shot. If you have thick course hair or are mixed I don‚Äôt recommend this. I kept applying it maybe 3 times and there is still hair there. I tried it on my lip since that‚Äôs not as thick and it still left hair on my lip. So bottom line: if you have thinner hair then I recommend this but if you‚Äôre of mixed race like me with thick hair then don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
"Terrible movie. Did the author direct this? What‚Äôs with the chapter announcement every five minutes? Also, the monsters look like an even more warped version of a ninja turtle so there‚Äôs that.",0
"Uncomfortable, seemed ineffective with vague instructions. Waste of money.",0
"Despite spending almost an hour with a very patient Amazon tech support person, I could not install this wi-fi extender. Possible issue is my ATT U-verse internet router that may be incompatible with this product, at least by following the included instruction sheet.. The Amazon tech attempted to contact the seller to resolve problem but had only an email address and no phone number to call. I am very impressed with Amazon tech support and would give it 5-stars for effort.",0
"Worst trash bags I've ever used. They have the strength and durability of a food handling plastic glove. The bags dont tear properly at the perforations, making it a huge hassle to separate a new bag from the roll. If you're not careful, it'll tear sideways away from the perforation and make the next bag have a huge hole in it. I tried lifting a half-full bag out of the my trash can today, and the bag ripped apart under the drawstring. Very light load. Utterly useless and horrible product.",0
The reset buttons do not work. When I added additional coins the next day the indicator on the top did not add to the amount on the lid. I would not purchase this product again.,0
"VERY disappointed after getting notice and notice that the item was on it's way, it never arrived to my father which was very upsetting because this was the first Valentines Day in over 30 Years he was without my step mother! I SENT more than one reply and even a request for the item to be credited back to me and YET nothing!! DON'T waste your time or MONEY!",0
Used it for three days and on the third day the pole snapped at the base and broke off!,0
"I do not like the trio of shampoo, conditioner and leave-in conditioner because I do not care for the fragrance of them, I left the leave-in conditioner in and styling gel and it turned white so I'm returning asap. I don't know if I will order any more of their product",0
No information on how to operate,0
Bummed. I placed the order because the listing shows the book that matches my son's collection. The one I got is a newer publication and has the wrong cover. I already have the one I received and order this item to replace it so I would have the right now and now I have 2 of the wrong ones. Yay!,0
This series itself is all around terrible. This particular installment feels more like a corny action film than anything. Tons of over the top shoot outs and crack dealers and things. Any charm the purge movies previously had is certainly gone for this one.,0
The middle two USB do not work and half my equipment will not go through with the hub but work perfectly into the computer. this was a waste of money,0
Not quality manufacturing. Cheap. Quickly done. Won‚Äôt suit because they lack the appropriate receptacle for an EPA approved engine.,0
"As others have stated, What you get is not what you see here in the listing. Instead of a nice little glass vial with a screw on lid you get a cheap plastic piece of crap with a cork stopper. I can see all kinds of problems with this coming open inside the aluminum keychain fob. I bought four hoping to add these to my gifting box but I wouldn't give these to anybody without replacing the plastic vial with something that seals securely. Nice try but epic fail.",0
I have returned the item to the mail lady she picked it up from me but have not seen anything yet on the refund.,0
I ordered this for my sister‚Äôs birthday and when I opened the box it fell apart in my lap. I wish I had of read the reviews because this seems to be the normal. I am getting a refund. Cheap stuff that wasn‚Äôt even put together. Don‚Äôt waste your money!!!,0
IT showed that it was delivered but I never got the items.,0
Do not buy. Arrived open and popcorn was all over box! I want a refund or a replacement! Was also left in rain with no plastic on it so it was a real soggy mess on my porch!,0
$35 for a two week supply. Way to expensive. Sending it back.,0
"I'm disappointed that just a few hours right after I bought this, Amazon lowered the price 7 dollars. I can't find where I can request a refund for the difference.",0
Item was NOT what i ordered. I wanted the bag you could put on your suitcase and they did not give me the correct one.,0
Didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs has specks in it. Thought i was buying white. They could do a better job making thAt more apparent. Otherwise nice paper if you wants specs.,0
One of the bulbs arrived broken,0
Tried it more than 3 times....didn‚Äôt work at all,0
"Screen protector is garbage. The privacy screen is false. It degrades the quality of the screen. With it installed, there are dead zones of the screen",0
Way to small for a 10 year old,0
"For the first month I put up with ""poor internet connectivity"" as an excuse. I moved it right next to my router and it has always said it's well connected. Everything else works. Totally loved the intermittent interaction with my pet during the day but it doesn't work at all now. I have reset per the instructions about 30 times now and it really does not work. Sad thing: I convinced several coworkers to purchase this. Petcube support is not helpful.",0
"First time using this cover. Worked great initially on the trip out. By the end of trip back, despite being securely attached, the stitching on one side had ripped out and the entire rubberized coating on the fabric had removed itself from the underside leaving a fist sized pile of rubber flakes in the kayak. Totally surprised this self destructed. Have another brand cover on the 2nd kayak that has been serviceable for years. If this is not appropriate for use in transit then the description should clearly state that as people are buying these for that purpose. One star is generous.",0
It doesn't straighten your big toe at all.,0
"My PT Therapist recommened this wobble cushion to sit on. However, I tried it for a couple of hours and got a but ache!",0
I bearly received the headphones 2 days ago and one earbud completely cuts on n off üòî,0
It didn't work and my lawn is full of weeds!,0
It‚Äôs just cheap penny junk poor quality don‚Äôt waste your time and I had to wait nearly 2-1/2 weeks for this same thing you can buy at the swap meet for $2. Very disappointing. Not recommended,0
"I bought because cheap, woops. It broke within 2 minutes. The rubber belt is stretchy like an inner tube so it is near impossible to get a grip, and when i did it just snapped.",0
"I am very unhappy with these socks. They are so small and tight -- and it was very, very difficult to put them on. They felt too tight once they were on -- and they did not stretch out. When I washed them in cold water, they shrank even more. I can't wear these and I would like a refund...please. David Peck",0
Shows different weight every time i check,0
The seat was shorter than the one I wanted to replace causing me to be closer to the handle bar,0
Did not like the quality. Had a spongy back so that makes it hard to remove.,0
"I bought this for one specific tag on my inner thigh. After using it multiple times over the course of a couple months. it has yet to do anything. The tag turns white, becomes uncomfortable to clothing , and then just remains the way it was. So a waste of 50 bucks.",0
"A word of caution on color. This is not blue as shown, but rather a greenish hue with hints of blue. Otherwise it is a nice silk flower. I wanted something more blue vs. more green.",0
Picture makes it look like you get two but they only deliver one,0
Terrible quality. Too thin. I think a tissue would work better!,0
Package was torn at top and bottom with the tender quick all inside the box. Very disappointed. Was not packaged well at all. Tossed around with other items in a large box.,0
Its already out poor quality,0
"Very cute, but it came broken, very disappointing",0
Not as protective as other speck cases,0
Is not good quality. Only used 3/4 times broke within a week or less. But in my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt say the problem is not the vendor I honestly just think the note 5 pen is not durable... period. This was my third pen for my phone but my first order from this vendor,0
I cannot review a product when I have not received it yet. It was supposed to be a hostess gift for Christmas Eve gift to my niece. Very disappointed in the delivery of this item..,0
biggest piece of crap i ever got on amazon.,0
"Went by reviews but I can't even describe the taste, there's none! It's colored water, don't waste your money!!",0
Poor fit. Poor quality.,0
I ordered 2 of them. One was broken at the bottom when I opened it. I contacted the seller had they had me send them pictures of it being broken and the order information. Once they receive that and three to four days later they reply was to contact Amazon. Would not recommend buying these from the seller,0
"So upset. I use my phone for Sleep Cycle at night, connected to headphone playing white noise. I need to keep the charger connected as i use the headphones, so i thought this would be the perfect solution. I bought two! At first they‚Äôd work on and off, if i fiddled with them a bit... Unfortunately they both stopped working - like other reviewers have said, an error message pops up that says the iPhone does recognize this accessory. Ugh! This is a waste of money - don‚Äôt buy! Trying to figure out another option... ughhhh, SO FRUSTRATING!!!",0
Do not buy. It didn‚Äôt charge my shark hand vac.,0
My printer would not recognize the cartridges. Could not use at all. The seal brokers on one of the cartridges when I removed it from the printer.,0
"The color wasn‚Äôt even close to the picture/description, as well as the size. The sleeves were too long, while the bottom of the fleece reached almost to my belly button. (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 125lbs and ordered a size small.) I‚Äôm in the process of returning it after paying $10 to ship it back üôÑ in hopes that I will get a refund. It took almost an entire month to arrive, too. Don‚Äôt waste your time.",0
"The hem pulled off after one wear, and the slip is now unwearable. Pretty crap product.",0
This is NOT white coffee. It brews very dark and tastes just like traditional coffee. Do not get scammed by this product.,0
The adapter overheated. Asked for an exchange.,0
I have had this item for well less than one year & the item has a vertical Purple stripe out of the Blue. The unit looks great on the desk but can't really get past this horrible stripe.,0
I have had bottles of Elmer‚Äôs glue that have lasted me for YEARS. I didn‚Äôt open this bottle until about six months after I had purchased it and a few months later the inside is covered with mold. I could see if it was being stored in an area of the house where the temperature fluctuated but it has been in my bedroom the whole time. For some reason I had convinced myself that maybe some black paint had mad it‚Äôs way into it from a previous project but no. I‚Äôm not sure if I should just stick to buying a smaller bottle or just move to a different brand. Pretty gross.,0
This is a review on the replacement sound machine because the original one I bought made a funny chirping/ squeaking noise when the projector function was on. I received my replacement in October. It is now February and only 4 months after using it and the projection has stopped working and of course my window to return it has closed. Crappy product and wouldn‚Äôt buy again!,0
Missed guaranteed delivery date - I ordered this to coincide with another product and expected an on time delivery and it was missed...now the delivery date is uncertain. Amazon needs to stop using USPS since those deliveries are always late and unpredictable.,0
this candy is very hard hard hard never again,0
Smoking and burning within 2 minutes of turning it on! Smoke coming from between the food insert and the heating element. Not okay! Amazon sent me a replacement and the replacement did the same thing! Will not be purchasing another.,0
Boxes were shrink wrapped but looked like they‚Äôd been stepped on. Tried to get a refund for prime purchase and for some reason it‚Äôs ineligible. It was like a chalk powder lining the shrink wrap bc all of the cigarettes are broken inside AND there are not very many inside,0
"They were to big, not the right size for the car that was specified on the site. Would not purchase again!",0
"Only had 4 in a pack not 6 and they were impossible to pull apart. Also didn't work well on my narrow, close together knobs of my entertainment center.",0
All of them failed to charge IPhone & iPad after 2 / 3 months of normal use,0
Very hard to assemble and not what the photo represented.,0
"They are hard to buckle in and need to have a deeper seat so,the pet sits down inside more .",0
Has a strange off flavor not true cinnamon. I wouldn't buy again,0
"As others have commented, the product is not right. I have used and ordered this and other Red Flower products in the past, but this new formula is terrible. Smells great but very watery and to not lather very well. Unfortunately, I ordered a while ago and just realized that is was bad after the return period.",0
"Would have liked to review, however my package was empty. Please refund my account or send another.",0
Product sucks. The stuff you're supposed to peal off won't come off. I wasted 2 trying to pray it off.,0
Horrible quality . So give to this over stuff cheap quality pillow and over priced. The idea of ‚Äú one size fits all‚Äù is clearly their mentality,0
"I took note of the reviews that said the clock just stopped working, but decided to try it anyway because of its looks. And make no mistake, it is very good looking. Unfortunately it does not work. I even tried replacing the first fresh battery with another fresh battery. It ran for 2 hours and stopped again. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Howard Miller changed their supplier for their clock movements. The low-cost provider can become very expensive if you have to handle a lot of returns and your brand is damaged.",0
"Battery worked fine for about 3 months, after which it would not hold a charge. The only reason it gets one star is that it does indeed fit the tablet.",0
"I was obsessed with this lighter for a week, until it stopped working... piece of junk, STAY AWAY!",0
This pillow is way too small. My baby was unable to reach my breasts to latch. The pillow is all squished. Also it‚Äôs mentioned in the product description that it comes with a small head positioning pillow but I never received any. Would not recommend this as a feeding pillow,0
EXTREMELY disappointed . Ordered and paid for pink and received the wrong color . The package clearly says pink .,0
I have had a problem with stink bugs this winter in my house. I bought 2 boxes of these traps. I have killed tons of them and not one has gone near these stupid traps. Don't waste your money. Huge waste of money at almost $15 a box.,0
This product was shipped on time. Unfortunately is was not the product featured in the listing. The listing claims it‚Äôs anti-perspirant. But what arrived at my door was deodorant. I have issued a disputed but the vendor has not responded.,0
"Grounds fell through even when I set the grinder to course. So I had to use a normal paper filter anyway. I like to grind my coffee to medium coarseness, so this does not work at all.",0
Impossible to get cats in and then have them stay there.,0
"I have bought the ped egg before, and I think this is a counterfeit. It is cheap and poorly moulded. It also arrived quite dirty with unknown filth, and arrived more than a month after I ordered it. I doubt it is safe. I washed my hands after throwing it in the trash.",0
The item did not work well for us. It needed to be stronger.,0
"Don't trust this seller, I haven't received my order and I order it months ago",0
"Hi Seller, I have not received my stuff. Thanks",0
This item got all torn up after only 6 months. Wrote to the company to see if they would do something to possibly return or refund and never heard any response.Waited to even write this review giving them an opportunity. Even for 50.00 I feel like the purse should of held up better than this. Stitching comes out very easy and IS NOT something I would trust with my gun. BE AWARE,0
Worse thing ever! Do not buy!,0
Stupid ! The ball goes everywhere then you want it to go.,0
received it broken. would like a refund,0
Three times I ordered 16 inch brackets and today for the third time I received 20 inch brackets. Packaging is labeled as 16 inch brackets but measure out at 20 inches.,0
"I never received this item. Other items delivered on Oct 19th were placed on door step, in excellent condition. I was hoping the product was just lagging behind. I was hoping to receive the pads before my training exercise scheduled for Nov 3rd. I need to resolve this issue. If I need to reorder the item, I need to know is ASAP. Thank you. Ray Solis.",0
I will never order from Amazon again. I never received my package. Thia is not the only first time they lie! Their drivers need to be more honest,0
Terrible. Watered down lotion and DOES NOT ENHANCE TAN! Do not buy!!!,0
Did not properly fit phone,0
I never got my item it never showed up,0
"The umbrella is quite large. 3+ people can easily fit under it. It worked well for shade but rain is another story. It leaks from the top, in ththe center, where the handle meets the fabric of the umbrella. I reached out to the seller but was directed the contact Amazon. Because I am outside of the 30 day window, I am stuck with an umbrella that can only be used for shade. So this was a waste.",0
Not a good product. Tried grinding with it and the grinder would just keep shutting down on me.,0
Bracket that holds handing files broke in less than 60 days of lights use!,0
"Does not work as described. These reviews are false. DO NOT PURCHASE, not even eligible for return. Do not make same mistake I did.",0
"Don't waste your money on this belt, it lasted less than 2 months and already broke, i have to reinstall the old belt for now till I get a new 1, absolutely terrible craftsmanship on this belt.",0
Avoid for shrimp tanks. Killed many cherries.,0
Eye shadow came in busted. Huge dusty mess everywhere.,0
Parts were broken before I received them.,0
"I was very excited to get this. I've actually been reading and considering buying one for months. It came yesterday. As I put it on and tightened it something on the screw snapped so now its permanently stuck on my camera. I didn't have time to mess with it because I had an engagement I was hired to shoot. Made sure my batteries were charged and headed out. I was very impressed with how much more natural it made my camera feel..... but... and this is a big but. 2 hours into my event and both the batteries had died. I had to leave my event go all the way home and get my 2 spare batteries... long story short I lost time, money and photo opportunities. I wouldn't recommend this product just for what it cost me. So now I'm stuck with it on my camera and draining batteries unusually fast.",0
The product is smaller than the dimensions listed on Amazon. The description lists the griddle a 16‚Äù long by 14‚Äù wide. The griddle is actually 12 1/4‚Äù wide. Would have ordered the larger one if we had known the dimensions were not exactly what was listed. Considering a return.,0
Didn't work. Instructions are not clear.,0
"You cannot use a different microphone than the one that came with your camera. This is a major limitation, which means you can't make a video with high quality sound. It claimed to be a webcam, but after an hour of modification, I gave up. You have to download a third-party app to complete, for the price, this is medium, the iPhone can definitely shoot better videos, I don't recommend buying",0
This is crap. Don‚Äôt buy it. No instructions.,0
Never received product,0
Display didn't work out of the box. Returned for a refund.,0
The fountain arrived damaged and was different than the photo on Amazon. Color was different (black vs speckled) and texture of sphere on top was different. I processed the return through Amazon but the seller doesn't provide a pre-paid shipping label so I had to lug it to a UPS store to ship instead of just getting pick-up at my door. Then I had to provide the shipping number and the shipping cost to get reimbursed for it. Really cumbersome to deal with. I will check more carefully for return process when buying from an Amazon seller!,0
"Not fun, doesn‚Äôt do what it says. Doesn‚Äôt follow at all. Pretty lame.",0
"When I opened my package, it had black marks all over it.",0
I guess you really do get what you pay for.,0
they are garbage. They do not keep there seal at all. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,0
"I bought this watch as new, but it seems like it has already been used by someone so badly! The screen is scratched, straps are awfully dirty. I am returning this piece of crap ASAP!",0
"2 came in the pack, 1 didnt stick right right out of the gate. 2nd one stuck for 2 days. Followed instructions for the install, just a horrible product.. Most of the reviews are not for the screen protector, dont know how they managed that....",0
Did not look like the photo. It was open on the back.,0
Doesn't even keep drinks warm!,0
"I purchased 3 sets of these lights and they have been nothing but problems. I have tried to contact this seller multiple times but no response. These lights will not stay connected and will just start flashing like strobe lights. Not ideal at all. Seller, Please contact me as soon as possible. I would like to be refunded.",0
"Crap, broke after 3 months don't buy this!",0
1 knife manufacturing defects,0
Don't waste your money unless you have cheap headphones to begin with.,0
I bought this rate to hopefully get the hair off of my artificial grass. It‚Äôs too soft and it does not get the grass out. I wish someone made a tool for this need.,0
"So small, and the whole thing got very hot to the touch. Not recommended at all.",0
Item stated it would come in original packaging- it did not. Item has hard/jagged pieces of someone's old screen protector stuck to it.,0
The sound was way off. It was almost 2 seconds off of the mouth or action.,0
"As a cosplayer I own a numerous amount of wigs. I've never had a wig have this much fallout. I couldnt even style it without pulling out chunks of hair. Save yourself some heartache, time and money. Buy the more expensive wig.",0

"Really cool backpack. Good full size and the sequins are great but after two months of my 8 year old using it five days a week the loop at the top ripped off and one of the straps is starting to tear off as well. She‚Äôs 8, so there‚Äôs not a lot that goes into her bag as far as weight.",0
"It says it comes with a charger and it does not. I ordered one the first time and it didn‚Äôt come with charger, I emailed this company and they sent another one no charger the band was already on it. I am not happy.",0
I disliked it due to the fact of how small and very pigmented the picture looked,0
I received this product today when I opened the box it was missing the creme developer.,0
Stopped working after 2 months,0
This product is dangerous for children. Do not buy,0
Broke within a couple months,0
"Disliked how Lacey pushed her parents into talking about their marital issues. That's between them and if they want to share with her, she should allow them to do it on their terms. But anything for our kids even let them document such a private story for personal gain.",0

We opened it played with it and it turned wet and melted in your hand and left blue color all over!!!! It was horrible threw it right away!!! Do not buy this,0
"Buyer beware! I ordered this earring because I truly thought it was so pretty and they could be worn with just about anything. Imagine how disappointed I was when they sent me a pair earrings that I didn‚Äôt order. Not going to pay to send them back, not to mention the hassle.",0
"Very disappointed! The information was very misleading by giving the customer the assumption they were buying more than one product for the outrageous high price and the metallic instrument was very cheap for that price. When I spoke to an Amazon personnel they also believed the product came as an assortment of 12. When I received the 1 product, it was damaged by being cracked and discolored. I have now returned it waiting for my refund.",0
Sticky but not dried out so easily peeled off. Not recommend.,0
"Not a good value as the selling price is 2x the price that you can buy these at Target or Walmart. Would definitely not buy here again,",0
I regret my decision to purchase this product. There were blue and red lines all over the screen and I couldn't see my screen clearly.,0
Range is closer to 30 miles or less not 150 miles. I don‚Äôt live in a valley or have large obstructions around. Disappointed in signal strength.,0
"THIS IS A HORRIBLE CAR COVER. IT'S LIGHT, MADE SO POORLY, TORE AFTER ONE WEEK. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE! THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE ON TOP AND IF YOU DON'T SEARCH....YOU WILL BE TRICKED!!",0

CANNOT GET PAIN OUT OF CAN. WOULD LIKE TO EXCHANGE,0
The bottom of the jar is cracked and leaked in the plastic.,0
No matter what we tried we could not get our newer laptops connect to an old projector with this. Multiple computers would not communicate with it.,0
Already broken after two days. I know these are not actual climbing caribiners but they should last more than two days. Using as a keychain and the spring just quit. Extremely low quality,0
Poor quality. One filter broke internally after 3 weeks use.,0
"The one star is because it looks great. Otherwise I went through three motor assemblies and all of them failed, the first didn‚Äôt even work out of the box. The deadbolt motor assembly is so cheap it cannot last on daily use for more than a week.",0
This item is a true failure. My mistake for not looking further into it before purchase. And regret not making the time to return it. Just picked it from under some papers and shook my head!,0
Part arrived broken. Have not received email response from company regarding replacement (4 days ago). Very disappointed.,0
Failed on the first use. I would not trust this with anything critical. Power pin broke off.,0
"Don't bother. It won't stay attached to the garage. Used the adhesive they provided, and it fell. Used carpet tape and several other tapes- stayed up longer. The lower panels remained attached mostly, but the top ones slowly separated from the garage door, looking ever so classy.",0
It was more like a kids M. Way too small.,0
These are the worst fitting xxl compression socks ever. I would have trouble thinking that these would fit someone that used large ones.,0
3 bags were open and completely empty in the shipping box with hot cocoa powder on everything. It spilled all over my floor when I opened the box. Unacceptable. Not eligible for a return either!,0
"This thing is a piece of crap. It died 4 months after I bought it, and no longer under warranty. You have to fill it through the side door, which is horribly inconvenient, because you have to leave enough clearance, and it can only be filled from the right side of the unit. The top door is to access the ice bucket, which is necessary because the dispenser keeps jamming. My favorite part is that when the bucket is full, it will randomly toss an ice cube out of the front of the dispenser, on to the floor, so there is always a puddle there.",0
"Pillow had a hole within 2 weeks of use. Returned for refund. Big mess, beads everywhere in bed!",0
Gave a 1 because zero wasn‚Äôt an option. Received cracked. It‚Äôs cheap. Don‚Äôt buy from them because you can‚Äôt return broken items. Rip off,0
"Great size and like the glass bottle. However, it constantly leaks no matter what is done. It seems to even leak when it is just sitting upright. Do NOT waste your money on this.",0
Very dissatisfied! Product ordered was for 3 months and received supply for ALMOST 1 months worth. Bottle also says 3 months supply. They are deceiving and not to be trusted. ONLY SELECTED ONE STAR BECAUSE THERE IS JO OPTION FOR ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!,0

Broken in under 2 months - save your money - lid is plastic not stainless steel.,0
"These are tiny, the middle section can hold a few raisins, blueberries or m&ms. I'm talking like 5. So for a small snack for a toddler, this would probably work. But for bigger kids it doesn't serve much purpose, even for snacks. If it were half the cost, I probably wouldn't complain, but for what they charge for these things, I recommend spending your money on something more useful.",0
ordered on 25 Feb no delivery on 27 Feb as promised. Replacement required.,0
These do NOT work. All you hear is static. No music comes through at all!!,0
Did not receive all bits. 3/4 was missing,0
"I am an older woman in my 70‚Äôs. Ordered this chair thinking I could use it while recuperating from a broken shoulder and hand. Unfortunately, this chair is so heavy that I can‚Äôt even remove it from the box. The weight should be included in the description. My problem is that neither Amazon nor Best Choice Products will help me with returning it. It is useless to me. So disappointed in Amazon. I buy a lot of merchandise from Amazon since I cannot get out to shop. If the sellers they use are unresponsive, they need to help their customers. I‚Äôll think twice before ordering again.",0
Cheap plastic. Damaged from the box. Hinge barely holds the weight of the product itself. Did not hold my Galaxy S8 in landscape orientation. Only 2 rubber feet - not enough to keep the charger in place. Returning.,0
I have chronic knee pains due to arthritis. I gave this product I try but am not happy with it. It even made my knees fire up in pain. Im going back to the other brand its a bit pricey but really works,0

If you are looking for something to listen to the radio on beware that radio doesn't have an external antenna on it. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had realized that.,0
Pieces were coming off it,0
"Bought this to clean up cat hair . It does not do it. The spinning brush has stopped spinning if there is any tiny pressure put on it. I'm not talking about heavy pressure, the least amount of pressure, just putting it on the floor stops the brush. Its useless.",0
Taste horrible. Couldn't tell if it was doing any good. Waste of money.,0
"When I first received the radio I was delighted by its small size and the clarity of the sound. But, less than two weeks after I received it, after I recharged it, the radio didn't turn on. I tried it the next day and the same thing happened. I returned it.",0
I ordered this book for my boyfriend in the army. It came all bent up and ruined. I don‚Äôt even want to send it to him .....,0
"These pants suck. Extremely cheaply made. One layer of fabric and it's not even very soft, the pockets feel terrible on top of everything. The drawstring fell out after about 2 washes and the pants shrunk as well.",0
"The shelf is great and suction cups seem fine and able to hold weight, however, it doesn‚Äôt sit level.",0
They do not work as well as described. They don't stick as they should to the phone. They somewhat hover over your screen so it slows your ability to type as your finger cannot touch the screen like it should.,0
Super disappointed with this product. I always get the notification saying my phone can‚Äôt connect with the accessory. Wish I never bought this.,0
"You think you're saving a little bit of money, but you aren't. As other people have commented, they screw around with the order and it takes forever to get to you. Mine was cancelled with no explanation and then delayed twice. When I got the camera, it worked great for about 6 months. Now, it won't turn on. It is NOT UNDER WARRANTEE IN THE US because despite them not noting this, it's not a US model. I'm now out $600 to get it fixed with Canon and if I don't get it back in time I will be out even more money due to renting for upcoming shoots. The 5D Mark IV is a great camera. This seller is not.",0
Handle is crooked and overall super poor quality.,0
Beware buyers! I ordered Gold and received Orange! No return policy nor any contact info so I am stuck with the wrong color! This is unacceptable! I have a huge show this weekend so now I have to go shopping for gold ones.,0
Worked OK for about a month. Now completely dead. Worse than the one it replaced,0
"Good for a short period of time. Now they want to change modes or cycle through modes when the lens is pulled out to make a spot beam. When barely touching the switch it will also change modes. Wish they worked the way they are supposed to, because I really like the size and convenience, fits in watch pocket on jeans, very handy.",0
I bought this for the Galaxy S9 plus and I should have read it the reviews first. As they said I the reviews it doesn't stick to the phone screen and when you put a case on it your touch screen is useless. Do not buy this product for the Galaxy S9 plus,0
"This is not keeping time, we have replaced the battery twice, checks the hands and cannot understand why it won't work!!!",0
Came opened and dripping,0
"Worked for 5 days and then nothing. It would act like it was working and online, until I got to location to just find it dead. I am in Texas, where it hit 100 today, but this thing was in the shade and protected from rain. Didn't even get to try it with rain.",0
"I had to move my mount for my VAVA magnetic phone holder. The old adhesive had to be replaced. I‚Äôve gone through 2 of these in 24 hours and it won‚Äôt hold the mount in place. I‚Äôve cleaned the area with alcohol and it won‚Äôt stay in place kept coming off. Also it pulled off very easy from the actual mount it self. The adhesive wasn‚Äôt very strong, and this product is actually bigger than the area where the adhesive goes.",0
Remote never worked. Can‚Äôt find a way to get a new one. Lights will not work,0

My cat used to love this stuff and would wait for me to put on her food before she would eat it. Now she backs away from it. I can tell the texture and color has changed too.,0
"game really let me down, game was extremely sub par, did not follow first game at all. i was a fan of the first one but i hate that i wasted my money on the second one.",0
I was so excited the first time I purchased and it scented my home so well that I bought two more. ALL 4 stopped working. They shut off after a couple minutes and don‚Äôt hold a scent. Very disappointed.,0
This is my third and final order of this coffee and the first bag was great but the second bag was delivered with the bag not sealed and so was the third. So needless to say the beans were dried out. I'm not happy. Before I opened the box which contained a few other items I could smell coffee. I knew immediately this was not going to be good. I will never purchase again.,0
"So cheap, broke in two week",0
I have not received it. I ordered quite sometime ago. Hopefully I will get it.,0
Product Box was clearly opened before. Left side of box was dented and front covering has dents as well.,0

Ouch--major splinters when you hold these. They need to be finished. Sent them back.,0
"I owned one of these before, intimately familiar with it. This unit has defect in the roller wheel that snags up and stops. The top doesn't snap open like my previous not either. That's where knockoffs can be seen - in the tiniest important details.",0
"Bought this product in Dec 2017 used it on a 3 day trip in December worked fine, a week ago was getting ready to leave for the summer and it quit going up so I had to hand crank. Junk so buyer beware barely lasted 3 months.",0
Don't buy this. Very low quality crank. The leverage mechanism is based on a single pot metal pin and broke on first use. Too late to return item.,0
"I emailed this seller trying to resolve this and so far have not heard back. I needed this for a theatre production, but settled for Walmart brand after this result. Not worth the hassle!!!",0
Said 2 pack only got 1,0
Never received product,0
Bulbs were bright and nice color but half of them have gone bad in a year.,0
This is piece of shit!!! Do not waste your money for this!!!,0
Piece of crap. Plugs have to be wiggled into place. Last one dies after 4 months. We don't make anything anymore. I guess I should try to find an extension cord at n antique store or make one myself.,0
"It was working fine for a while but recently it decided to stop charging after a few minutes of being activated. I need it to charge my phone until it's dead, not to stop charging seconds after I activate it. The first one I bought worked fine, but this one is very unreliable.",0
"Super thin, paper plates are thicker. Tried to send them back and the postage was going to be $100.00. Company responded, saying that they are a visual screening product only. Don't recall that line in the product description... Found a far higher quality product at our local farm and feed store for about 10 - 15% more.",0

"This is a fragrant oil, NOT ESSENTIAL OIL. Wish I read all the label carefully. Don't buy if you're looking for essential oil.",0
"Do not buy these, spend a little more money and buy QD swivels from reputable companies like Magpul, BCM, Midwest Industries etc. One swivel works fine and the other one is full of problems. The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place. If you are looking for QD swivels for a duty rifle or any gun you'd depend on with your life then look elsewhere, these will fail when you least expect them to. Buy quality and don't waste your money on these.",0
Complete trash. scam. I returned for refund,0
Bought this version because the lid looked like an improvement on previous models. It‚Äôs not. The water leaks everywhere and the only place it can be used is in a bathtub or outside. I paid more money to get the new lid and I should ha e just gone with the original model. Really disappointed with the product.,0
This is the band I received.,0
WEAK . it broke . the worst,0
"What a surprise, picture shows complete unit on a hanger but guess what no hanger! Just a fabric material with 10 clips attached very disappointing then show it that way in the picture",0
They were sick I believed. I'm assuming from the travel. Anyway infected my whole entire aquarium. All my hermits I collected Died.,0

I hated it. It didn‚Äôt mix well with anything.,0
"These headphone are the worst!!! They are Bluetooth sure but they‚Äôre endless static!!!!! From the moment I plugged them in no matter what I‚Äôm listening to, just loud static over what I‚Äôm trying to hear. DO NOT BUY!",0
Was never close to 4500 mAh. Probably more like 1200 mAh. Gave one 80% charge at most. It worked for about ten days then wouldn't take a charge. Actually drained my iPhone battery twice while I thought it was charging overnight. When it did work I had to charge the phone and battery pack separately. MADE IN CHINA. I should have known better. Headphone jack very slim. None of my headphones could plug in. Waste of time. Waste of money.,0
Pretty sure the driver dropped it over my fence and broke it so I never got to use it.,0
The original package was opened and taped shut. When I went to return the item it said ‚Äúthis item can‚Äôt be returned.‚Äù,0
I've been an anime fan for decades. This style of CGI and anime combination make what should be shows with great potential into garbage.,0
Cheaply made. Fell apart easily. Feathers began to come off a few months after purchase. Doesnt look that good in person,0
i had them for less than a month and one by one they all just stopped working and my phone would say ‚Äúaccessory is not supported‚Äù,0
Completely overrated. Did not meet basic expectation. A large area of cover cracked and shattered in my hand while I was sitting in my doctors' office using it. moisture and debris quickly became trapped under the cover. I replaced it a week later with an $8.00 protector that works great! Customer service was great.,0
"Shipping was horrendous package didn‚Äôt arrive Friday as scheduled and paid for, I‚Äôm going to look like a complete jackass, I‚Äôm filing a complaint with everybody I can file a complaint with for the rest of my life I‚Äôm so mad",0
"Everything was sent well-packaged, but the product had no sweetness. I have bought the same brand in organic and only needed one spoon in my coffee. With this one I need 6!",0
These little led lights are very difficult to string together and most of them dont work. The lights are so inconsistent meaning some will come on some will not and at other times all of them might come on but not the right color. It's sort of chaotic have to check and recheck connections. I would not recommend these for any type of advanced led job.,0
My phone will not fast charge with these cables Razor Phone 2. junk 3 weeks and all 3 no longer charge,0
The handle is very short so it doesn't work well for taller people without always having to bend over,0
"Buyer beware!! Tampered packaging & then no return allowed. When these products arrived to me, they were in already opened packaging that had been taped closed again. And then the seller would not allow a return.",0
Did not received. Do i need to reorder?,0
this was not the twine that I received. I go some janky white yarn instead of twine.,0
"Don‚Äôt know why but the costume was very, very wrinkled (plastic). Wondering if it was returned and not properly repackaged. The fan was not powerful enough as to keep the head all up and stretch the wrinkles. It did not look good when I tested it... even less for the price. Sending it back. Runs large. I am 5‚Äô7‚Äù and I think it would be too hard for me to wear it ... maybe it works well for a taller person or a big guy. Also, the tutu is nothing like the picture.",0
they broke the same night we got them don't bother,0
Not what I expected at all,0
They aren‚Äôt what I need I won‚Äôt send them back it wouldn‚Äôt be fair . Sincerely Kristine Brown,0
Stinks like chemicals. I don't find that it is real leather.,0
"Ordered these for my baby shower. It‚Äôs pretty small but does the job of favors. I put epsom bath salts in them. I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily recommend these for my favors only because they‚Äôre on the smaller side. The amount of bath salt I could place in them isn‚Äôt enough for my guests to actually be able to use. I read multiple reviews about pieces being broken and corks being difficult and they‚Äôre all true. I originally ordered two packages. Two in each package were broken. I ordered another two, and again, about two pieces were broken in each package. The corks don‚Äôt stay in, you do have to push them in pretty far in order to stay, HOWEVER, doing so, you won‚Äôt be able to remove them anymore. I tried to remove one and the cork ended up breaking into pieces. The glasses are EXTREMELY fragile. I dropped one that was broken at the top, into the trash and it shattered into a million pieces. Definitely putting a sign in front of these for the baby shower that says fragile. Also, needed to buy little baggies to put them in, that way if they do break during the baby shower, it‚Äôs within each baggy. They‚Äôre very cute, and does the job, but it‚Äôs a safety concern, the corks either fall out or don‚Äôt come out at all, and they‚Äôre pretty small.",0
They didn't even do thier job right and the screw not all the way in and now I'm fighting with them to get one different cuz its only one but I need to send both back but can't my old ones where broke,0
Flower is not attached to the clip,0

One didn‚Äôt last 1 month and the other less and 6 months. Junk!!,0
"This Bluetooth was useless. I could not hear the person on the other line, there was always background noise & the person I talked to always had to ask me to repeat what I said. The ear piece was uncomfortable & kept falling out of my ear. Not a good product at all.",0
Horrible product!! My hair looked and felt so bad after using it that I had to wash it. Does absolutely nothing that it is supposed to do and I am a frequent dry shampoo user so I know what it is supposed to do. Either this product is counterfeit or just horrible.,0
"Broke after 2 uses, not worth the money.",0
Extremely inaccurate readings even after soil calibration. Takes 90 seconds between each reading and there is no way to manually poll the probe to make the process quicker. Very basic and ugly user interface that makes the entire experience painful.,0
product claimed to withstand upto 2000 degree radiant heat but melted on my motorcycle exhaust pipes within seconds.exhaust pipes only get to half that temp. waste of money and gave my a nice clean up job to take care of,0
Goes in garbage almost right away,0
Confusion regarding what is free and what costs,0
"They break to easily, my daughter has been through 2 .",0
"The price was very reasonable, and I don‚Äôt have to go to the vet‚Äôs office to get it. However, the product is past its expiration date. And they put a ‚Äúnew‚Äù sticker over the expiration date, I guess thinking I wouldn‚Äôt notice. I would send back for a refund, but the return shipping will be taken out of the refund amount. Not worth it. Plus, I feel that they would probably turn around and resell to another unsuspecting customer. I‚Äôm dealing with my pet‚Äôs health - I want something effective and safe.",0
Advertised for iPad 2 but DUD NOT FIT!,0
Although it came out fairly okay - had I not painted them they‚Äôd look really cheap. This is the same material as styrofoam plates the same ones that are bad for the environment and are way to pricey for what we as customers are being duped into purchasing. Once I purchased it I had to keep going to finish the cieling. Looks better than popcorn but dissatisfied with what the materials are and how they look. For the price it should have came primed or already painted.,0
"The face was messed up on and the 1st one the the lights didn‚Äôt even work. My boys love Scooby-Doo and they saw when I was looking at decorations online and wanted, what a huge disappointment this item is.",0

"Very disappointed with Under Armour. Thought I was ordering a Golf Visor but was sent a CAP, not a visor. May have been a great cap and worth the money. Maybe Headline Golf Visor means Cap,still very disappointed with Under Armour, I was looking for a visor. Needed the visor for Christmas! The photo of the visor is not what I received. Called Under Armour and told them about wrong item sent, pretty much told too bad. Live and learn.",0
"At first they all worked, but the 10 foot cord stopped working after 1 day. Still pretty cheap price but if more break, I'll be pretty disappointed.",0
I have had 2 of these and the clip keeps breaking! The case is bulky and hard to hold onto to.,0
"Very disappointed, I thought the panels were plastic, but it's soft material, and no good for kids bedroom they will destroy this in a day. Also the doors don't close properly the magnets sucks, the instructions are crap. Right after I build it it practically loosened up moving to another room. Waste of money. not worth it I don't recommend it.",0
It took alot to shine it it looked dull at first i did not like it,0
"returned it. poor quality, air filler was very cheap, did not work well at all",0
"These are the worst screen protectors I've ever used. I applied it following the instructions as well as I could considering some Mensa candidate put a label over the instructions which were printed on the outside of the cardboard and pulled of the top layer when I tried to remove it. Not the first glass screen protector I've ever had so I knew what to do. I tried to clean with the wet wipe first, but it was dried out. So I opened the second one and it was just barely wet enough. I applied the screen protector easily enough. Let it sit for about 30 min. then put in my belt holster. The first time I took my phone out the screen protector fell off. I tried to re-apply it but it falls off all the time. It also has dead spots where the touch screen doesn't work. Just through it in the trash. I will try a different brand.",0
"So we bought two of these things, one right out of the box never worked. The instructions are horrible don't expect any help from what is said in them. The second one has worked pretty well for the time we've had it. But the tube that the led rests on the end of easily pulls out of the body that houses the batteries. Overall these things are cheaply made and junky. Returned the 1st one... we'll see about the second one.",0
"I tried several if the heads it came with, but none of them seemed to work.",0
The vacuum and the charging base did not work together. The vacuum only lasted a few minutes. Tried to fix but no luck. Really was a waste of money. Could do better with a simple little broom.,0
I ordered this 2 pack a couple of months ago for my Black and Decker blower and trimmer. They will not charge. The black and decker charger flashes red indicating a bad battery (both). I unfortunately did not try these until after the return window closed. Out of luck!!!,0
I am returning this item. Although it was a used item. I did not expect it to be filthy. I also did not expect it to come without the 2 cords that were supposed to be with it. Also did not have any type of instructions with it.,0
Product is hard to move and the gate panels are impossible to unsnap. Don‚Äôt buy.,0
Please note if you put these covers on you cant close your charging case and the phone will not charge,0

Changed to Netgear and bounced up to over 100 Mbps in the same room and over 60 Mbps on the other end of the house with 4 walls blocking my laptop. Don't waste your money. Comcast even Stated that they no longer use them due to need for upgrades and problems according to Comcast technician, who came to house because we could not figure out why my computer was having so many problems down loading pages and streaming video. It took over a month to figure out so I have to eat the cost.",0
Does not work sadly bought in October and just tried now. So no return possible. I tried adding the power supply as suggested in one review and still did not work.,0
"I would not recommend this product. The mug was discolored (had a brown ring and spots) after one use and was handwashed like the directions stated to do. I bought this set as a birthday gift for my husband after reading all of the reviews carefully. He loves Moscow mules and he loves to entertain, so this was a perfect gift! My husband loved them as soon as he saw them...until he used one mug once. My husband has one Moscow mule mug that he has used and handwashed for years and there has never been an issue with it discoloring. I just thought these with their hammered look would be better. Being that I do not want to poison my husband or guests in the future, we will not be using them again. Unfortunately since I am just past the return date, I can not return them but I definitely would not buy these again! Very disappointed after the good reviews.",0
I returned these cards. Featured in the card was a website for encouragement. I couldn‚Äôt get the website,0
Chair was shipped damaged. Shipping box was fine. Will be returning and not ordering again from this seller.,0
I was so excited to receive these since they‚Äôve been discontinued and no longer in stores. I did not expect these to arrive unpackaged. They should have been in the original package that is sealed. I‚Äôm hesitant to use them not knowing if they‚Äôve been tampered with.,0
"when this thing came in the mail I was so upset about how flimsy it was and just not what it looked like the picture, it is made out of literal paper, it came with a little white stick and a little dab of glue to glue it on to the letters... and it fell apart. I wanted to return this crap a long time ago I've just been busy but damn I regret not doing so sooner because my money was wasted.",0

"To be honest this wallet is ideal for the simple man which I am, however I purchased this item for the concept of hold 30 bills. Upon receiving I was showing a cashier my wallet and he lets me try 25 one dollar bills in the clip and it doesn‚Äôt even have a chance at magnetism. To be honest this upset me the most as I purchased it for this reason, their approach at saying these are rare magnets thatll hold 30 bills is a complete lie and over sell. Again the wallet is amazing for the simple man, however unless you like being lied too this is not your wallet.",0

"This was the first time I purchased any Chemical Guys product. The problem I have encountered has never happened to me before. I have used all sorts of car care products from numerous companies and not once did the spray bottle malfunction or break on me. I was underneath my FJ and the spray bottle worked great for two sprays and then stopped. I never dropped it, I checked that it wasn't in 'off' position, I made sure the top was secured tightly. Still wont spray. I guess i can transfer to a new spray bottle but it has to be a new one because i dont want to chance getting another chemical mixed in.",0

There has to be a better product than this one.",0

"Worst drip coffee maker I ever had, and i used cheaper and less brand name ones. What's going on there during brewing that makes coffee grounds spray all over the machine? I have to wipe showerhead every time after use because its covered with coffee grinds. I NEVER had this happen in any type of coffee machine. And it's not too much coffee or water since water leaks thru and I get half a cup of coffee regardless of how much water I pour in. The WORST!!!",0

I used this perhaps 10 times and it always worked great. And then it just stopped working altogether.,0
The wrong product is what arrived. The box on the outside is labeled beer glasses but had a ‚Äúnew product‚Äù label with these carafes. Was very disappointed since I ordered them for an event soon after they arrived. Returned product and received refund. I wish I got them because they would have been perfect!,0
The wires burned with heat after first use. Thankfully we avoided fire.,0
I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He will get it in his Easter Basket on Sunday. I cannot rate this item until he uses it and we see how it works.,0
"Not only does the ring not close, there is no way that it is 18G like I ordered. I have always worn 18G in my nose and this would not go in my nose due to how thick it was.",0
The comforter was marked shipped and the tracking number j received was eventually delivered to somewhere in New York. Which didn‚Äôt help me confide ring I live in Philadelphia. I contacted the seller and they said that they‚Äôd correct this for me. I went to follow up about two weeks later as I never received a new tracking number or anything and got an email back saying that ‚Äúthis seller has left the amazon market place‚Äù. I eventually was able to get a refun from amazon customer service but this whole ordeal was a gigantic waste of time.,0
Is hard to write and doesn't read my fingerprint. And also has a wear circle on the screen that supost to read better you fingerprint. I heated this screen.,0
"Worst charger ever. I have had it barely one month and the metal part that goes in your phone broke off inside my phone when I went to un-charge, I had to use pliers to rip it out. Do not buy!",0
Fake product!!!!!! Smells terrible and dried out my hair. I've used the real thing and this is NOT it.,0
"This is hands down my worst amazon purchase. I am very unhappy wth it. They leak like crazy, when you squeeze the liquid comes out the sides of the bottle. I put an expensive cream in it, the bottle fell in tub for a second and it ruined the cream. Do not buy. Terrible quality",0
The strips I received all turned gray a few weeks after purchasing them. Too late to return. They don‚Äôt expire until 2021 and I kept the bottle closed and in a dark place. Not sure what happens. I guess they were pretty accurate at first. But after they all turned gray I‚Äôm left to wonder if they ever really worked.,0
"The picture quality is not too bad, though it's not that great. The sound sucks bad. Like unless you put your mouth on the camera and scream it's not gonna hear it. Battery is not too bad for this type of item. I think I just don't understand how picture quality is rated for a camcorder, it is consistently ok so it is probably the way it was designed to be, my major gripe is the sound which is non existent. I will try a major brand next because this did not do the job. Who wants silent videos.",0
"This cheap hamper might be okay for temporary use. ""Dorm use"" is a stretch and I definitely don't recommend it for a kids' room. The one we bought has been in use for exactly one year. You can see from the pictures that it is now falling apart. The fabric mesh has several small rips and is coming away from the seem in places. Two of the thin metal bands that hold the structure of this hamper have come loose. One of them is a loop and the other has a sharp terminal! The one that is a loop used to be very small. It stuck out just a little. Because the band is so thin in profile, it was invisible against the dark blue hamper full of dark clothes. It caught my toe as I walked by and ouch! It sawed between my toes as it pulled out from the fabric. I spilled my morning coffee all over the bathroom. We probably should have replaced this hamper months ago but I was being stubborn. Don't be like me. Spend a little more and buy a real hamper. If you need to get one of these for temporary use, throw it away when it starts to break up. A kid or pet could probably get hurt on this thing.",0
My son backpack started peaking within the first week.,0
attach the battery connector. This is so cheap.,0
Other than being totally dented on one side it seemed ok.,0
Never received package thankful that seller FINALLY refunded me. Never buying from a 3rd party again,0
It does not work for me!,0
Was easy to install but I didn‚Äôt like the quality,0
Sadly I trusted what I bought because of the name Ritz being involved. They made this look like a good sling for an SLR but my Canon T7i with battery grip is to large to go in the bag at all. Even with no padding it won't fit. They would allow a return but the shipping fee is so much I would only get $4 of my money back. So what's the point. Don't buy this bag if you have a real camera.,0
This item arrived damaged again!,0
"Tried to pair new Kenwood radio with iPhone, android and couldn't get it to work. Tried to use it with Mac Pro laptop and it would not work. I sent the first one back, no luck with the second. I had to return it also. Seller claims it was the fault of my ""car computer."" No help at all.",0
Priced twice as high as target for same item,0
"I loved these at first, but two of the 4 are already cracked after less than a month of use, they were not dropped or put in the dishwasher. Disappointed!!",0
Very cheap causes splinters,0
Keyboard has stopped working in less than 5 months.,0
"For the second time, this product came to me defective. The contents do not have enough pressure to spray out the nozzle, so the contents just drip out. Can't use on my hair. How can I receive a refund or a replacement?",0
The pair I bought in the store for my girlfriend seemed like they were better. These headphones ended losing their Bluetooth capabilities. And after a few hard workouts the speaker lost power and was quiet.,0
Tried to pair multiple times and never worked!!! Only pairs when 10 feet apart! THIS IS NOT WHAT I PAID FOR!,0
"As soon as we opened package and tried the first one, it broke. The other two seem to work ok, but I was pretty disappointed that we started with a broken one. Not sure how well these are going to last.....",0
Too small not at it shows on the photo,0
3 of the ornaments were broke or defective. üò©,0
"Stiff,short, hard to swat. Like slapping metal around",0
Horrible. Have bought for family member no one has liked them at all. Would never reccomend.,0
Bought this for my small dog to have water throughout the day in her crate. It leaked all the water into her crate and barely stayed fastened to the crate. Very cheap plastic.,0
Couldn't find a way to set the wallpaper...... Disappointed!,0
"these creamers were sent in a very damaged state. the box was very damaged, and the creamers were all leaking. had to throw them all away, ( what a mess ) don,t replace, just refund .",0
"The convenience of this pool cover is great, as it clamps conveniently to each leg of the frame. However, upon opening my pool this year, I noticed tears in various spots on the cover. It only went through one season! You would think the manufacturer understands that this Intex, 18' above ground pool is made for outdoor use, and the cover needs to have the same resistance to weather. I live in southern California, but the pool cover is tearing before being hit by the summer heat. It's only May! Color me very disappointed!",0
It would be nice to know what it was that I ordered!!,0
Followed all directions and glass did not stick very well. The only sticky part is the top and bottom of protective glass. I dropped phone on two separate occasions and protective glass popped right off. Guess I'll just stick to otter box.,0
"Received this mixer in July. Didn‚Äôt use it until now. Big mistake!! It is broken - the mixer makes a loud noise while mixing, and the beaters don‚Äôt spin smoothly. My return window is over, and now I have a broken mixer.",0
"Too small, too bad, keep looking",0
No return policy. Seems confusing to put together and there are no clear instructions or videos. I also would need to buy a luggage rack to make this work.,0
Never received item. Seller did not answer emails.,0
"Though it would help with acne scars, but did not do a thing. plus made my skin oily. useless !",0
Waste of money screen protector does not let me type like it should peels off instantly does give privacy but quality for the money its a no no,0
Worked for 4 months and then quit. It worked great until it quit working. I charged the unit and it would show green. The on botton quit working. It must have a short in it. Product made in China. Waste of $48. Very disappointed.,0
"Key did not work, just kept spinning in cuffs",0
It started leaking the day we got it!,0
"I have adhesive stains from two-sided tape holding rugs on flat carpet. Used first time today on two section following directions. The stains are still in place. Did not work for me, unfortunately. They were a year old not new stains if that would make a difference, For those two stains I used up a half can.",0
Just a hard piece of plastic that slips over the phone. Provides no screen protection since it does not have the rubbery insert. I should have paid more attention to the description I guess.,0
I purchased the frame in May 2017 for a teenage boy who weighs about 150 pounds. Welded pieces started falling off a few months ago. Last night the entire frame caved in due to the broken pieces. Disappointing and waste of money.,0
"Gave this as a Christmas gift. Package was damaged (probably previously ordered, opened, and returned) and was missing the base station.",0
Terrible. False claims. May as well have ordered a time machine.,0
"the sound and quality* is great, just make sure you dont somehow damage the usb-c port like i did. the quality of the sound, the mic pickup, all of it is great and i love the design but the huge flaw is that the usb-c port is just weak and when damaged renders the headset useless",0
"dont waste your money, at the first time that the kids used it there was one broken...",0
The zipper keeps getting stuck.,0
I guess I did not receive a new one since it wasn‚Äôt even packaged properly and came with a child‚Äôs ripped drawing inside...,0
It didn't even faze the dogs at all the just walked into it like it wasn't even there!!! Waste of my money,0
Very short and slide off the hands. Any material you‚Äôre working with will enter through.,0
It loses data and files become corrupt on a regular basis. Piece of junk.,0
Doesn‚Äôt help with anything. I bought as per my colleagues recommendation for sore throat and and cold symptoms- did absolutely nothing l had so many cups of this ...!!!,0
This product does not work as good as I thought! I placed these pads on the bottom of my soles and they within 24 hours fell off. I was in a meeting and one stuck to the ground and it was quite embarrassing.,0
"Very cute, but the great battery lasts 20 minutes. A regular alkaline battery lasted 5 hours on high.",0
very small and uncomfortable,0
"I bought 2, do they look like unicorns?",0
The mats are flimsy and already starting to crumple and fold. I‚Äôd like to return these.,0
"iF YOU ARE DIABETIC OR SENSITIVE TO SUGAR, LEAVE THIS ALONE. They have loaded this with so much sugar to hide the taste you will go into a coma with one gulp. LOL! But it is pretty bad.",0
Snapped in place in less than 30 seconds,0
"The customer services is great and very helpful. The battery on the other hand is garbage, the pins get pushed into the battery whenever it gets inserted into the psp which then causes it to not work or charge them. Had this issue with the first one and they immediately sent a replacement and same issue happened with the second.",0
"Feel like I wasted money. I followed the directions and the protein doesn‚Äôt even show a color that is on the sheet. It stays an orange color. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what. But also, the colors tend to bleed together a little which also makes it inaccurate.",0
"As soon as I plugged these in, they got very hot. I returned them.",0
"First of all, the product came dented. I used it anyway and hated it. I used half a can on a small night stand to get a half way decent paint job. But, I gave up on it. Every time I painted the piece streaks and blotches would come through. I tried to water it down, put it on thick, and even use a primer. But, nothing worked. It just got uglier and uglier. And, whenever I touched the dried paint a stain would appear. I would wipe it off. But, the wipe mark would cause a discoloration. This is so frustrating. I‚Äôm done with this paint. Oh, by the way, it was the gray paint.",0
"So Flimsy... Can't even survive the shipping process. When a box arrives in perfect condition but the hook is bent to such a degree it's practically unusable, it is definitely a quality issue. Don't waste your time and money on this.",0
"This product was way to small for me. I ordered a 4x hoping for it to fit, but it was nothing like the picture. The sleeves were more like 3/4 sleeves and the length barely went past my waist. I was not happy with this product at all!",0
"My package was empty. Thought it felt light, opened it up to find nothing but the inside of the package bag. Serious disappointment for this medical student. I‚Äôll change this review when I‚Äôm recieved what I paid for.",0
FREE - ITS FREE BECAUSE YOU NEVER RECEIVE FREE,0
I have not received any shoes. Please check into this matter and refund my money without delay Thank you,0
"NOT worth the money or complicated install. Would never fully turn off and would drip non stop. Bought in Sept and the inside pieces already broke. Contacted Enzo for warranty help, they're willing to send replacement parts but we opted to just replace the faucet...",0
"I ordered it ‚Äúnew,‚Äù and it definitely appears as though it sat in a book store window since 1989. The book itself came with water damage on the back cover and discoloration on the book jacket. Some of the pages were also folded on the corners.",0
"These are BLUETOOTH headphones that you plug into your phone for power. Which kinda defeats the purpose of Bluetooth all the while draining your battery even more. There is zero mention of this, so either these damn things are defective or inaccurately advertised. DO NOT BUY.",0
"The outdoor temperature quit working about 5 months ago. I have had less than a year. I cannot get assistance beyond them explaining to remove/replace batteries, and the sensor replacement is essentially as much as the item. My grandfather is so sad, he was truly enjoying it while it was functioning.",0
"It didn‚Äôt take long for the wheels to start snapping off. If you‚Äôre going to buy rollerblades, invest in a quality pair that will last you",0
I had this TV for five months I set it up right and it just fell over and broke it never worked right in the first place don't buy it,0
Got my own fast. No issue with seller. Nothing like a Magnum,0
"The lights flicker when you dim them, making this product useless. I used it on a floor lamp that has four 60-watt incandescent bulbs. I didn't keep the original packaging so I cannot return it. I just wasted $16.99, so beware, and do not do the same.",0
Didn't even buy the camera. Cancelled the order before I got it. Still never got my refund.,0
I would not buy this ever again. There was a static sound that came through the headphones all the time. It worked for about a month and now doesn‚Äôt work with any headphones. Definitely not worth it.,0
I tried this product 3 times and each time my hair was like straw. Apparently it does not do what it is supposed to. I would like to return it.,0
Not very good. Not worth the price. Awful quality! Awful quality. Don't buy. far from ok. I was very surprised at the poor quality of the product.,0
This is the most horrible shirt. Does not fit what so ever. Its extremely short. Don't buy it. It's a waste of money!!,0
Didn‚Äôt like this product. When I would wash my hands moisture easily got inside and then I couldn‚Äôt see anything on the watch. It was a pain taking it apart just to wipe the inside. I returned it for a refund.,0
Did not last I bought these in June of 2019 and now September 2019 they don't work. I have a red pair that I have had since 2016 when they used to be just noise hush and still work. The earbuds have gone down in quality. Even the packaging was better in 2016. I decided to try again with another pair but even on the highest volume I could still hear the outside noise.,0
My daughter was desperate for this toy. It is overpriced plastic junk that she played with for barely two weeks. Now it‚Äôs in the trash.,0
unless i have something set wrong. this is the worst camera i have ever owned. not happy . way over priced,0
"It's finally football season and I was so excited to use it to watch my favorite team play but when I set it up and went to sit down I heard a pop! The plastic support broke out of the chair! I'm a 6'0"" male and weigh 160lbs so it's disappointing that the chair didn't hold up to even one season.",0
I wish I could give 0 stars. We used baby dry when my son was a newborn and they worked great. Bought these and the first one I put on 2 mom later my son is screaming his head off. I finally make the connection and take the diaper off and he has BURNS all over his bottom. DONT BUY,0
"Doesn‚Äôt work! It quacks but that‚Äôs it, doesn‚Äôt even attempt to blow bubbles. Will return! Very disappointed as this was part of my son‚Äôs Easter basket!",0
Arrived damaged. Contact support with no response.,0
The lights a lot cleaner than the old ones I had but some of the housing was cracked so I had to rig it myself to not deal with shipping it back,0
Less than 2 months and the car adapter no longer works.,0
Not easy to have two speakers connect,0
The silk is beautiful! My baby loved it but my wooden ring broke after she had it for just a couple days.,0
"Definitely a one time use, material starts to stretch within a hour and just keeps stretching. material is pretty but would only buy for a small event or costume",0
"This watch case lasted 16 months before the case back flew off after dropping the watch onto the floor. I recommend this as a travel beater watch that you won't mind losing. However, the band didn't last longer than three months for me before it started to delaminate after repeated cycles of sweating and drying. Thus I would recommend that you purchase more resilient aftermarket band that is less vulnerable to exposure to sweat if still considering this watch. After 18 months, the hand froze and the date stopped adjusting--thus I will be replacing this with a different watch.",0
"They fit well in the ear, but don't stay attached to the headphones very well.",0
"The pictures are cute and all, but the books are not very engaging, They don't teach the ABCs in the corresponding book.",0
A little deceiving from Facebook add looked like a rubber mask not plastic. Suit seems fine .,0
The headset I got my grandson some time it works an other tome it doesn't would like to return it,0
"OK BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. NOT IMPRESSED WITH. SEEMS SMALL. AGOOD BANDAID WOULD DO SAME. CAN ONLY BE HONEST ,",0
"These markers looked perfect for what I wanted them for, AND they were a great price as an add-on (which was why I didn't give one star). But they really disappoint once the lid comes off. The colors are bright and vibrant, but they bleed together. While they may wash off of clothes (I haven't had a need to check) it does not wash off of the dry erase board. Even after a few minutes, the black stained my dry erase board. No matter how hard I scrubbed, it's still there. I will try what someone else suggested, and use a clorox wipe. But, I don't like to use those, and I definitely don't want my kids using them. If I wanted a permanent marker, that's what I would have bought. These totally negate the purpose of a temporary writing surface. I will NOT be purchasing these again OR recommending them to friends.",0
Notice NO difference between these and regular reading glasses,0
Would not work with my HDX. Seemed like pad would slide out of case.,0
Didn't work that well for me.,0
"Misleading cover, I had thought it would be a great book for a child to use to learn piano with help on colored or numbered keys, but it is not geared for a child regarding this. It teaches how to read sheet music and proceed with the piano lesson with basic children' s songs. I had seen other books start a child out with getting the child to learn the keys by numbering them or coloring them with stickers. Making it more fun for the child to participate in a piano lesson.",0
I only receive one even though the description stated I would receive a 3 pack.,0
The baby alive brunette came in good condition but not function correctly. When you feed her with noodle occasionally nothing happens and the you need to use your finger to take out the noodles. It‚Äôs so bad to my niece. I don‚Äôt return because it‚Äôs a Christmas gift and she threw the Box. I don‚Äôt recommend it. Don‚Äôt waste your money.,0
Didn't like at all but I am not going to pay to return so will just sit around till I throw it out.,0
"I had the same problem as the other reviewers, it keeps losing connection which is very annoying. We got this bulb for the nursery - you just leave the lamp turned ""on"" so you can control the bulb. Every time the power has gone out the bulb comes back on (because the lamp is in the on position) which is horrible for our nursery - this always seems to happen w/storms in the middle of the night. It has lost connection and needed to be re-added several times so we've given up on it. We have several smart outlets but this was our first smart bulb. We will just get another smart outlet instead. Sad, we wanted to be able to turn the light on/off w/voice when we have our hands full w/baby.",0
I dont think this is gonna be the go around we hoped for. Google asked for much more than a log in name to get into this app. I had to do the youtube.com/activate routine. Now they know what device I'm using. darn it.,0
"These are rated very high, and I love that they are made from whole foods. But they make me very nauseous (I am not pregnant, but taking prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy), and a serving size is 3 tablets at a time.",0
"I bought these because of the lower price compared with similar items but what a mistake I have made! The sheets are so thin and the cover fell off within the first few days of school. They are not the type of notebooks I usually buy and I usually buy them at a local store, but this time I was being lazy and did not want to make a trip to the store. But a lesson is learned. I will stick with my usual brand.",0
Material was not what expected,0
Don't think it really does anything,0
Little girls underwhelmed by the neutral colors; over time polish got thin and didn‚Äôt cover well,0
It wasn‚Äôt exactly like the picture and a a stone came off same day I received it but it was a beautiful case so I have already ordered 3 total all at once won‚Äôt purchase again though because of that low quality product,0
Hard to use don't open easily and then hard to put over goat leg,0
Needs a really smooth surface. Not easy to fine in most houses,0
TOOOO MUCH INFORMATION! AND...most of it is like previous materials I've bought from you. :( So didn't give away as intended.....and now the return date has past! Sigh......!!,0
"I am not sure if I received a legitimate product. The diameter of the tube is not the same as the diameter of the scope. It looks cheap when installed on the scope. As far as function, I am sure it would serve the purpose just fine. However on a $1000 scope I want something that both looks and performs well. I contacted Amazon and their service was great with helping me get a refund.",0
Not for a truck driver,0
It will work but it is so thin that I am afraid of breaking it with normal use.,0
This may not be a reflection of the actual product but these owls definitely didn't stop other birds or critters from nibbling at my plants :(,0
Causes blisters and still must wear band aids and sox if I want to wear them!,0
Jewels fall off alot. Had jewels off when arriving.,0
"I know previous reviews said it was smaller than the discription but I thought id try anyways. There really isn't any other options out there for the xl Power Air Fryer. This is VERY small!! I havent even used it yet bc I cant seem to find use for something so small. (Im referring to the pans.) Now its too late to return it. Unless you have a small Air Fryer... DO NOT ATTEMPT to buy this anyways! I should have followed my gut, with the other reviews. Shame on me! The cup cakes might be fine and the metal racks might be okay... but I mainly wanted the pans to work. Guess Ill be giving this away to someone who has NO FAMILY OF 5. :( I gave this 3 stars bc it doesnt seem HORRIBLE just FALSE dementions were described from the seller.",0
Broke easily. Fast refund.,0
I wasn't sure I would like the book. It was a short and I'm at best. I couldn't get the additional books. Otherwise just ok,0
Trigger warning. I‚Äôm sick and tired of TV shows using rape as plot. It‚Äôs disgusting.,0
"These unfortunately fell apart after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer. They‚Äôre very soft, and mostly wrinkle resistant, but not durable at all!",0
I suspect it is my fault but they all died.,0
I did not like them they are too heavy they are too noisy,0
I bought this and used it and had only 2 flushes. I don't know what happened. It lost it's potency.,0
Why change in cap design? Arrived damaged and spilled soap contents seeped from the sealed box and spread to other items in the box. The seal on the original bottle design worked great! This item is not eligible for return with subscribe and save. I am going to cancel my next order and purchase another brand that ships better.,0
Much smaller than expected and product box was damaged and looked like someone used Scotch tape to try to reseal it. Was embarrassed to give this as a gift due to condition received.,0
Craftsmanship is far worse than the listing picture alludes. It looks like a first attempt at welding by a 7 year old in a poorly lit garage. Sloppily painted with silver to cover what must be rust. I will most likely return the two I bought.,0
"I‚Äôve replaced all shoe laces on my toddler‚Äôs shoes with these. So far we‚Äôve lost 4 end clips, no matter what we do they keep coming off and getting lost. Worth buying only for the elastic laces; I‚Äôll stick to Lock Laces from now on.",0
This product takes forever to get the wrinkles out of your clothes and you have to keep filling it up with water. It's really annoying to have to keep running to the sink to refill it. It is a more ideal for removing wrinkles for maybe like one clothing item. I like to remove the wrinkles out of my clothes after doing laundry and I usually have a couple clothing items and I cannot efficiently get it done with this product.,0
Unfortunately this didn‚Äôt work my scalp acne.,0
Came all crumble up didn‚Äôt like the way they packaged it,0
I've noticed no energy boost in this latest bottle. I've learned from visiting the GNC site that people are complaining about a formula change and are experiencing the same sluggish feelings I'm having. The bottle I received have green pills. I remember the yellow ones were much better.,0
Have bought much more high quality antlers. This one didn‚Äôt last long at all.,0
I have not found a quick and easy way to successfully tie these so the beads don‚Äôt all fall off ; hard for my 8yr old,0
"I‚Äôm writing this review at 3:45 AM after taking 3 of these. I love my Natures Bounty Melatonin, they work.",0
Very poor quality. Thin and small.,0
Product was great but the box was smooshed and the bandaids were all over. It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt care when they sent them how they were gonna get to you.,0
"I bought this for my daughter and wish I could return it. I would not buy again nor recommend. Yes, it works but battery life is short and every time after charging it there is an issue, the time is wrong or it won't turn back on. Too frustrating for my daughter and for me. Sometimes it goes to military time and no idea why. By something better. Also its hard band to put on. My child cant do it on her own and she is 9. I would skip purchase.",0
This broke after a couple uses. Really disappointing.,0
"It‚Äôs a super weird material, it sticks to your body and is a pain to get off. It makes you sweat a lot but putting it on and taking it off is a pain",0
Cool looking tpu case with a sturdy ring but my wife's main complaint was that the ring doesn't rotate 360 so it's in a rather uncomfortable fixed position and therefore she never used it.,0
Mosquitoes were flying towards the sticks... lol didnt work for me,0
Disappointed. Back to carry both my phone and a wallet for me. If all you need is two credit cards then it should be fine for you (I needed 4). More than two are too tight to remove consistently and even worse if you are planning to use wireless charging like I do you will be out of luck if you want to carry more than 2 cards (iPhone and Samsung Wireless Charger combination) as wireless charging stops working the moment you insert the third card in.,0
I bought this July 27th and it's December 5th. I need to replace it because it is ripping apart at the seam.,0
The product says it is wall decal but it is a glass decal. cannot stick it on wall.,0
It was not as I had expected and very strange to be obsessed over a number.,0
This is a VERY cheaply made product. Not worth $70 dollars. The way this thing mounts to the wall is terrible at best. Again this thing is junk. If you are looking for a bathroom fixture keep looking.,0
This is not a prime product. Says it would be delivered in 2 days if I order by a certain time. Had plenty of time left. And now it‚Äôs a 3 day shipment.,0
"Movie was great, don't need to read the book, as there is so much detail it gets boring and I never finished it. But I highly recommend the movie, which I saw on a flight, about a subject I had never heard anything about.",0
Beautiful but clasp fell apart . I never got a chance to wear it,0
"Loved this as soon as I put it on, very slimming. Washed it on DELICATE in a mesh bag, hung to dry. Went to wear it for the first time and saw most of the stiching came undone in the bust and was falling apart. Returning for money back.",0
"So I ordered the part one of the twilight breaking dawn move and I open it, and the part 2 DVD was in the case",0
It is very sturdy and durable. Used it for 2 kittens.,0
Not what I had hoped for. Shortly after loading it jammed up and stopped cutting. I took a few out and proceeded but it jammed again. The few that did cut properly was okay. Went back to using my garlic press.,0
"I ordered this in the XL size thinking it‚Äôd fit my XL dog (English mastiff). I would compare to a small child‚Äôs blanket. It‚Äôs nice and soft but the size is completely throwing us off, the dog doesn‚Äôt even fit on it. We are giving it to the kids to use and buying a large Costco blanket for the dog..... perfect for little dogs but don‚Äôt let the size fool you....",0
My feet are very small and I couldn't get the correct size that I normally buy. Therefore I had to send them back. I was disappointed because I had another pair that fit great and lasted a very long time. I found another brand that is good.,0
did not receive instructions in english; I have no idea how to use this product,0
Thought the loops were be much larger. Could not even fit on my lobe. Gave it as a gift to my three year old niece.,0
"It lasted a week....the pleather already tore. Pretty bellows, not made for use, good for display.",0
"We use these in our headlamps and other camping flashlights, and our experience is that they don't last as long as other batteries.",0
"This set looks great. However the tutus & tiaras smell like rotten eggs. Our party was 2 days after we received these items. We tried to revive them with fabric freshener, a dryer cycle, and airing them out. Nothing killed the stench. Super disappointed for my party princesses.",0
"I have a 1998 Chrysler town and country. When I tried attaching it to the vents it cracked. Tried multiple times. Should be a warning not to use on older vehicles as vents may be brittle. Also utilizing Samsung s8 plus with magnetic strip, s8 plus and set on top charger causes my phone to get hot to the touch. If this warning was in place I would have got the CD holder. Now I charge with cord.",0
Loos and feels cheap,0
"Pricey, didn't notice any benifits after use after 3 months of use didn't seem worth it to continue",0
"My son needed a ukulele for music class, this ukulele is more of a play toy. The strings are plastic and one string immediately broke after opening it. We returned this and had to buy the more expensive one..",0
I carry a bunch of stuff some related to an injury and a rather extensive first aid stuff so I need a lot of pockets. Got tired of caring a big back pack or bag. My first pocket vest is about to give up the ghost so I needed new one. Only thing I did was add snaps to some of the pockets to make sure they didn't open up by mistake. I also add stuff to it when I go camping. Revision. It's not cotton. The design is great but the implementation stinks. Had to make repairs on it due to crappie sewn seems. Not enough fabric at the stitches and they used crappie thread. I'm on my 6th or 7th repair and have not used it that much so far. Stitching is coming lose way to often. Junk.,0
"I didn't try the stickers, but the tape didn't work as well as I wanted it to. I threw a party and told everyone we were going to be playing glow in the dark kickball. I put this glow in the dark tape on the bases, let them ""charge"" in the sunlight, but by the time it got dark, none of them worked. We couldn't play because no one could see the bases. Disappointed.",0
Did not spread well or blend in. Is totally not water resistant. Ran into my kids eyes when they got wet. Was not impressed. Sorry.,0
What is this and the cost?,0
Speaker sits nice but I can't run my speaker wire through the stand exit hole. It's to small so I made it bigger alas it still doesn't matter because where the pole joins together there something on the inside that doesn't allow it to pass through unless I cut the connector off and reinstall after I pull just the wire through,0
WAY TO SMALL! Item is not as described..,0
I ordered the extra large and they are very tight and I am not that big. I am under 6 ft and weight 155 lbs,0
It was not durable. Hard to fit stuff in.,0
"This thing works ok, and I like the idea of using plastic grocery sacks. The down side , and the reason for 2 stars, is that it arrived with a crack in the bucket. The box was not damaged in any way that it was shipped in. Possible quality control issue. I was able to fix it with duct tape, but for $28, I expected something better built.",0
"I got this for my 19 pound french bulldog (runt) and he did not fit in it. He is way too big overall. The biggest flaw with this item is the lining, which is a stiff taffeta like fabric that has no give and is VERY shallow. The outer fabric is a nice, soft knit which has a lot of stretch to it. This sling would be great for a very small, short dog.",0
"The product left my waist length, non-color treated hair feeling weighed down and oily even after thoroughly rinsing. It smelled great but I ended up returning it.",0
Too firm. The first couple of nights were OK but then I started to notice frequent headaches. The design is unique and ambitious but I guess I just need a softer pillow.,0
The wrap does not get cold enough or hot enough no matter how long I froze or microwaved it. It's super heavy and basically worthless.,0
The game is fine but they sent the one that was not ... Please if you do not have the order to indicate it before the purchase ... Be more serious ... That's why I had not taken the time to evaluate them ... Very bad. I wanted the fifa 2018 World not this game :(,0
Barely lasted two weeks and my road trip lasted 4 weeks. Disappointed. It's exactly what I needed but it didn't last. Don't know if it was a quality control issue or design. Need to find a good alternative.,0
"We thought this was the new one and it wasn't, was disappointed.",0
It didn't work as well as I expected.,0
"Love the look. Sheets arrived, I put them in the wash, and as I was putting the pillowcase on I noticed a large rip. Not sure if it was shipped that way or if they ripped in the wash. Was hoping for better quality.",0
kinks no matter what,0
Not keeping the food warm as expected. It is really just a storage container,0
You get what you pay for. Most were dried out and you couldn't see on skin or paper. Disappointed my daughter.,0
The fabric of these shirts was thin and threads hanging out everywhere. Seemed very cheaply made. I loved the colors but the fit and fabric was not as what I expected,0
This jacket is small and came unstitched after only several uses. Not a good example of American made.,0
"Super cute, but they don't stay sealed unfortunately. Could never put in the mail. And even with putting heavy duty packing tape on, that tape even rips up so I think it has something to do with the material of the bag (super heavy duty which is nice).",0
I used for my daughters car seat & totally not what i expected. It looks supper cushioned and thick for comfort & it looks nothing like that its supper thin and not cushioned at all.,0
These boots are CHEAP for leather boots. You get what you pay for. Mine started falling apart within 4 months of buying them. I will say they are fairly water proof surprisingly.,0
"Very thin material. Never try to iron the wrinkles out, it melts very quickly. Tears easily. Will stick to oversized bandana.",0
Not ‚Äúdance‚Äù tights. I would consider them regular pantyhose.,0
"Read full description. Noises were ""scary""and terrified both our kids.",0
"The case closes awkwardly due to the large nail clippers. Also, the picture shown is misleading since the two nail clippers shown in it are the smaller ones, and the product I received came with a large and small nail clipper.",0
"A few good ideas, but I find most of the recipes to be incomplete or lacking in proper instruction. Being new to the Insta pot game I kind a like to have a little more detail about what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing. Would not buy again, would not recommend.",0
"The photos of this product show the first edition version. When I received this book, it was the much later, differently-covered version. This made it impossible for me to use it to replace the first edition version that I accidentally destroyed at the beach. (Life lesson: do not read comics at the beach.) Fortunately, when I confessed to its original owner about what happened, he was forgiving, and accepted the lesser book.",0
Its for a person with a large head,0
Product does not look anything like the picture,0
The containers were barely half full. If they were the right amount I would have loved them cause they were perfect but most def not 1800 of them,0
I bought this labeler because a different brand that I had would not print labels that stuck to cables very well. This one seems to stick a little bit better but it wastes a lot of label material as others have pointed out. You can set the length of the label but it always prints out much much more than needed so you have to have scissors ready every time to cut off excess.,0
Bad colors. Waited almost a month for this? Half of them are good. The other half have colors that are just washed out and awful.,0
"They taste alright, but man the price is way too high. You might as well save your money for the vending machines at work...",0
Purchased as a gage gift. Nothing else needs to be said.,0
I did order fine point pens and I expected them to be fine but ink comes out way too light for purposes.,0
The dress is too short compared to the picture on display,0
This is ok... Unless it gets wet. The middle part is just a cardboard tube that if it gets wet it completely crumbles. Doesn't last long at all.,0
"the messages were fine, but the print is very light and sometimes difficult to see.",0
I didn't get all my screws,0
"Ahh! I hate to write this review... I've been a die-hard Schmidt's user for almost a year now. I've loved my natural deo, as I'm a sweaty person. It's always been easy to apply, and even the next day, no sense of body odor coming through! Help control smell, sweating, no more pit stains.. AMAZING! It seriously changed my life. Until, about a month ago, I got another round of sticks, and this time, I'm developing rashes within a couple days. I've gone off it, and it's cleared up, but within a day or two of coming back, these Very, Very, painful lumps and bumps pop up. I'm not sure if they've changed the baking soda balance or what, but I can no longer use this deodorant. It's too painful. I've started seeing more and more comments and reviews on the web about similar experiences. I'd love to come back to this product in the future. --note, nothing else about my hygiene or lifestyle has changed.",0
Placed it on my phone and was unsticking...plastic material.,0
"This thing could give hearing to the deaf, or at least be in the standard rotation at an old folks home (for use Without Hearing Aids!) My brother owns one, but I failed to notice that he kept it in the basement play area. We purchased one for our 4-year old, who LOVES IT, but I can hardly think while in the same room. The default setting is NASA SHUTTLE LIFTOFF, and you need to turn down the volume every single time that the button on the touch pen is accidentally/purposefully hit (which is all the time). In conclusion: this is a great product with only one flaw: the default setting is LOUD AS HELL. If Oregon Scientific would change that, then this would be a 5 star toy.",0
These labels look great and are very handy to label ammo boxes to stay organized. The ones I placed on top of ammo cases (on smooth surfaces) have stuck fairly well. The ones I placed on the sides of a semi textured surface (ammo crates) have not stuck well at all. I even prepped the surfaces with rubbing alcohol and let dry thoroughly.,0
"This is definitely not the original replacement part which hoover used to make. It does say that in the description, but it also makes you feel like you are getting a decent replacement for it, meaning the bristles should be the same direction as the original replacement part. This fits, but the Bristles on the roller all go in a circular pattern. The original roller had bristles at the one end that went in a ""v"" so the dirt would be pushed toward the opening of the suction hole. This roller the bristles are continuous, like wrapped around with a single ribbon, so dirt gets pushed all out to one side and sometimes spits out of the bottom side of the vacuum because there isn't the ""v"" formation of bristles on the one end to stop the motion and push it toward the suction hole.",0
"It doesn't dispense liquid soap out very well and have tryed to increase the amount, also the sensor doesn't work that well. I wont purchase this item again.",0
"I ordered this dress for an all white event but the dress was an off white type of color. Unfortunately I was not able to wear this particular dress, but will save for future needs.",0
"For as much as I paid, I expected the scent to be more potent but I can barely smell it. I smelled my cheaper one a lot more.",0
"I bought medium, and the waist band is tighter than necessary. Also, the lower part of the band tends to fold up onto the higher part of the band, leaving just half the width (and extra tension) touching my waist, which isn't comfortable and looks bad too. Not sure if this is because of the tightness, the thinness of the band, or both, but I won't be buying these again.",0
Not all of my bulbs work as they should like 2/3 work,0
"I wouldnt recommend this. I couldnt care less with rainbow patterns but when dust gets under, it defeats the purpose of a protective screen.",0
"The mice toys a are in good condition and arrived in a sealed bag. However, I ordered the mice with a regular tail and received all feather tailed mice. Unfortunately my cat doesn't play with the feather tailed ones.",0
but no so well on heavily stained glass....work as well as Clorox a ten times the price.,0
"I really like how it looks so sleek and conforms to the edges of my phone with the aluminum trim but it doesn‚Äôt adhere well at all, especially with the corners. With a case on, it presses on the corners lifting them more making a space/air almost an inch into the center, making the touch screen a inconvenience and a pain to easily press options on the screen. Looks great except the air in between the screen and protector, which ultimately makes it look like crap and hard to use....",0
"Arrived very dirty, i spent nearly 10 minutes trying to get all the grease off. I dont understand why there was even grease under the peel away sticker",0
It was okay.... I feel like the pages given on the inside is a bit disappointing. It isn‚Äôt very useful,0
"My John Deere belt and blade cut more evenly than this set (was a mulching kind). It's not cutting as evenly. Where the tires run this blade doesn't pull up the grass well enough to cut it at same height as where the tire doesn't run, whether the grass is wet or dry. Maybe blade doesn't have enough vacuuming effect. And, the belt may have some slippage due to it not having enough contact area with the pulleys.",0
"Quality is not bad at all, but is too tight. Pull out the credit cards is a nightmare.",0
I tried so hard to get into this book and storyline but I couldn't do it. The story jumped all over the place with too many side stories. The love story was so drawn out and just too hard for me to really enjoy. I wished for more but the book left me hanging all over the place.,0
"It works okay not too good, i would regret buying it",0
Fabric not great quality. Too small. Nice design.,0
"The video quality is terrible, the video freezes and does not detect motion in the moment when the sensor chimes, when it's daylight sometimes video comes through in black and white and finally any small wind will/can cause the sensor to go off.",0
"This is an attractive, substantial mug. For drinking cold beverages I think it is a very good choice. I drink hot tea from large glass mugs. This mug shattered the second time I poured hot water into it. By contrast, three of the four large glass mugs I purchased at WalMart 5+ years ago are still going strong (one of them broke for other reasons). Thus, I do not recommend it for hot beverages.",0
The game is shown on a portion of the screen only. The app setup was jerky and I couldn't select the favorite and rival teams for the different sports.,0
"Packaging states that its guaranteed jam and Smudgeproof... didn't jam, but the labels will not hold in from from my Canon Laser printer .. tried waiting to see if the ink would hold, let the labels set for a hour or so, still smudged . wish I tried it before the time to return it ... wasted $10.00 on these labels",0
"So the dress looks lovely right out of the bag. I‚Äôm sure if you have super toned I try bitty skinny arms it would be perfect. But I wasn‚Äôt expecting tony arm holes on a big girl size. Like biting into your armpit, someone chop my arms off or cut me out kind of small. Didn‚Äôt work for me even when I ordered another size.",0
"the holes to not line up properly at all, looks very cheap..would be afraid the lock would break if was actually able to insert it properly",0
Magnet is strong but it came with a chip in the side didnt really affect it but is a weak point,0
wrong carburetor was sent. Other accessories included were correct.,0
"The box was not inside a Amazon box, and was damaged. The waters were all scratched up.",0
Not sure what happened but I got regular lotion not shower lotion. It's okay.,0
Rough for bathing and facial use,0
This fit true to size. I was expecting a silky polyester slip. This feels more like a cotton blend material. It is not silky at all and not what I wanted.,0
Really poor quality compared to pictures,0
Not worth the money tastes no different than any other flour,0
"Product advertised to be compatible with larger TVs, that is not the case. The stand is too small for even the largest adjustment, should not be advertised to support larger TVs. And I apparently only had a small window to return the item and I‚Äôm stuck with something that did not work.",0
"Pros: - Strudy, solid handle, organizer compartment up top is nice, dust or water can't enter easily. - Design-wise, it looks nice and clean. I like that it's clear. Cons: - Mine came missing the buckle on the front. - The fatal design flaw is that that ""tracks"" on either side (where the hanging folder arms rest in) don't extend the entirety of the box sides. They just end mid-way. Thus, there is a full 1.25"" inch or so, in both the front of the back, where there is no track. Thus, you lose 2.5"" of folder space in the box. That ALSO means that every time I sort through folders and move them forward or backward, they easily pop out of the track. And that annoys the heck outta me. I would return it if it wasn't too late. It's ridiculous that the folders pop out every time I use the durn thing.",0
"Very fitted, stretchy material. Not true to size order 2 sizes up",0
"I am using this document holder at work, but it is very cheaply made. The clip in the center that holds the paper does not stay where it is placed so it slides down no matter whether you put 1 or 5 sheets to hold. Disappointed but kept it anyway as needed it right away.",0
"Decent comfort, sound, and volume, but after 3 months use they now hold only about one minute's worth of charge.",0
Putting it simple....it tasted like mild taco seasoning....every other Chicken Taco seasoning I've tried has a Southwest or Smoky taste creating a distinct flavor,0
I ordered these headphones on August 12th. It is now September 20th and the right side quit working. I also really hate how these ear buds fit into to ear. The sound wasn't bad before they quit working though.,0
Paint was coming off on drivers side bottom of the car but other than that it was great!,0
"The smell, as others have pointed out, is an odd mix that smells something like previously used cooking oil that's been sitting in the pan for a few days after you made french fries. Not good. Also, it's not very slick. It's not sticky, like water-based lubes, but it must absorb, increasing friction over time. Basically it was a waste of money, unfortunately. I'd recommend getting a free sample from their website before paying for this. Or just buy the same company's silicone-based lube, which is easily a 5-star product.",0
"I loved the taste, didn't like that if I had wanted to reorder it was on a two week wait, even as a prime member. I also didnt like the huge price increase! This price has almost doubled since we first purchased it! We wont be reordering, and we're disappointed because we love this stuff!",0
This would have been 5 stars except ours had clearly been opened and used! and we needed it for a present urgently :(,0
"By the time I got to this dress and tried it on, I was fed up with ordering on line.",0
Probably nothing wrong with the product. The issue is Apple from what I've read. Plugged it in and within 3 minutes the sound is off and message states that it's not supported by Apple. What's the point?,0
"I absolutely love how minimal this case is. I have tried three different cases for the Pixel 3xl and this one is my favorite. The only small changes I would like to see is an ever-so-slightly higher raised edge to help protect the front screen and a more beveled fingerprint circle to allow a more seamless scan of the fingers. Definitely the case for those that want their phone to look like it doesn't have a case (if the phone is black). Mine did crack while trying to take it off the phone once, but ESR quickly replaced it free of charge within a few days. Update: Got a replacement case from ESR and this one also cracked within a couple months (no drops). The crack appeared in the same place as the previous one. I'm giving up on this case and moving to a different one. Dropping review to 2-stars",0
"When I first unwrapped it, it smelled so bad I had to leave it on the porch. It‚Äôs a little too small for my ML350.",0
A few of the earbuds came broken. They ear piece fell off in transit. I bought them last year and had no issues.,0
The smell of this product lingers forever...and it does not smell that great. I have purchased better products.,0
I expected a sturdy one as shown in the picture. As advertised it seems that the material used in the product can be open and will remain upright but the actual product does not. It looks durable though but it has to be tested during my travel when I decide to use it. I was expecting the bra cups will not be squeezed but sadly it does. I want to return both the small and the large bags but I will be leaving already and don‚Äôt have time to do it.,0
They just stop working after 6 to 7 catches... i bought so many... my neighbors moved and its a must... so i keep replacing them... still buying them practically every month...costly,0
"Threw them away after 2 month of wearing , bad quality",0
made my face a little moisturize but still left little bumps on my face.. i have combination skin,0
This still doesn‚Äôt work well on my computer but I will continue to work on it.,0
"I have not used this. I went online to do some research an there is some mixed research about Garcinia, not about this product specifically, so I am still looking into it.",0
"The sf 666 microphone I ordered,was suppose to come with usb.It did not.I needed that.Now what?",0
The main sponge bob ballon was sealed shut so it could not be blow up with out tearing the ballon. The big Patrick has red dye stains all over it and did not stay inflated .,0
"But I couldn't. Perhaps my torso is too long, but the open cups were made waaaaay too large and the torso was not long enough. This caused a super weird gap between my breasts and beneath the open cups. I love the material, but it just did not fit right.",0
"I‚Äôve had this installed for about a week. Easy to install. Looks very good. Pump works well. However, the two stars are because it will leak about a dime-sized amount of soap into the sink. This seems to happen after it‚Äôs been used, like there‚Äôs some vacuum or pressure inside the dispensing tube. Every time I go in the kitchen there‚Äôs a spot of blue dish soap in the bottom of the sink.",0
I thought I purchased the open mouth one. The pictures were very deceiving.,0
It's cardboard and broke in the back.,0
I suggest not ordering these if you plan on using them as motorcycle gloves. This is not the intended use......,0
The dish is cute but has a blue stain on the bottom right corner that won‚Äôt rub off. Disappointing.,0
These all leak from underneath the cap when gently shaken or turned on side. Would not be suitable for carrying in a purse or bag.,0
"Initially this chlorine generator worked great for my above ground pool. However, as the summer wore on, it began to get very sensitive about the flow and shut off. I followed the directions contained in the manual and set it self-clean the electrodes while it worked. It didn't help much. By August it began telling me I had low-salt. I tested the salt several times and knew it was within the optimal range for the product. So I dissembled it and cleaned the electrodes. It worked for a day and returned to telling me I had flow problems. Within a week it told me I had low-salt again. I had to treat my pool with purchased chlorine for the rest of the season. I am disappointed the product that should have lasted two seasons, didn't even make it one.",0
I am disappointed. The heated part does not work and I just got my replacement today,0
This is a great product design and is perfect for storing your gas. The major flaw is the hand pump. It is made of cheap aluminum and is an absolute piece of garbage. The pump ate itself up on the inside to the point it completely seized up. Ended up finding aluminum shavings in fuel filters on my equipment. Replaced with a better hand pump.,0
Sugarfree and tastless. If you want a chocolatey taste these candies are not it!,0
Hard to use. A bit flimsy,0
All crackers were broken and tasted different from the ones I had in a restaurant in Florida.,0
I was not impressed at all. The applicator is big and bushy. So big that you can't see your bottom lashes to put it on. Usually when you remove the brush from the tub there is product hanging off the tip. It just isn't great for putting on mascara. And I didn't see anything special about what it did for my lashes.,0
The tabs that hold the game cards in place break off easily so beware and handle with care. I already returned one for this problem. The upside is that it's pretty cheap and stores more game cards than many other plastic 3DS game card holders.,0
Second one came broken,0
Need better quality control shitty sewing,0
I'm not sure that this additive works. My fuel mileage on my 2005 Prius and my 1994 Toyota Truck hardly changed!,0
The price is right but the quality is average. I have used the Solaray brand for years and I love it. Solaray capsules are smaller but has a stronger punch. Both are 500 mg. I won‚Äôt buy Nutricost again.,0
"I dont know how old these bags of flour are, but almost all our bags came unsealed. It looks like they had been glued shut originally, but the glue dried and poped off, and doesnt keep them sealed. There is no inner bag with a better seal either. If it wasnt for the outer plastic on these bags they would have been all over the box. I will not be buying again.",0
Kids bored with this,0
"When I got these, one of them was not working. The ready lasted about a month before giving out.",0
When I received it there was a power cord for the shaver but no cord for the cleaning system and the shaver cord dose not fit at all. The other problem is that there is no buttons on the cleaning system. The shaver work but that is it. Disappointed it the cleaner.,0
"I brought this so that I can use it‚Äôs Bluetooth for incoming calls. But voice quality was so bad that opposite party was having trouble understanding then I decided to put wire on but result was same, was very disappointing. I think this one is better when u just listen, definitely not for both way communication. Not sure how it got almost five star rating.",0
The toys were obviously cheaply made. The fidget cube barely works. Very small stress balls. The pea broke.,0
They are not great. Too dull & tried to sharpen. We were unsuccessful.,0
"Good so far but dont like the tacky cord that goes with it... Update, doesnt do well charging. Nice holster though....",0
It screws securely but it turns color rather quickly. Can‚Äôt use these,0
I followed the instructions exactly and it didn't fix the crack as advertised. It's fine for a quick fix but it didn't fix the crack they way they claim it will. The crack is still clearly visible.,0
The idea is very nice. The pieces don't stay they get unscrewed by themselves.,0
"I bought this product because I was looking for a more natural toner for my face and I know that rose water is great. Well the moment I opened the bottle, it smells like rubbing alcohol and it dried out my skin, and made me breakout more. I do not recommend.",0
"Very thin material, not very high-quality I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"I'll end up keeping it because it was under twenty on a warehouse deal but I would feel completely ripped off if I paid full price. The head is much smaller than it appears in the pictures and more important, the light is not very bright. It seems more like a desk lamp head on a floor lamp body. The controls are annoying and temperamental. I'm going to end up using it in the garage as an overhead adjustable work lamp, and I suppose it might have made a decent reading light, but otherwise I think people will be disappointed, especially at the current $55 price.",0
Came in ripped at the seems. Did not send back to avoid extra fees associated in the terms and conditions included in the package.,0
Part worked initially but required modification for installation; didn‚Äôt last long.,0
"There is an adjustment, but it's a very small hat. No option to order different sizing.",0
No setup needed however this remote is useless as you can‚Äôt return to the home screen or bring up the tool bar.,0
"Worked great for about a week, now won't work at all.",0
I am so disappointed. Protector broke as soon as soon as I tried to install it. I want my money back. üòë,0
"Not a huge fan. Never really saw a difference in anything related to my body that others claimed to receive. I didn‚Äôt like having to mix it in my drinks, it became more of a nuisance. I‚Äôm going to try pill form of myo-inositol and d-chiro inositol to see if it helps with PCOS.",0
"My husband purchased them for our employees for when they are working especially at night they had a pen with a light but the light is not at the end where you write its at the top and does not do the job we thought it would ,",0
BOLT PATTERN NOT CORRECT. USED MY HOUSING PLACING THE SENSOR FROM NEW ONE TO MY HOUSING. SEEMS LIKE ALL AFTERMARKET HOUSING ARE NOT THE CORRECT BOLT PATTERN. IF YOU NEED ONE I WOULD JUST ORDER THE SENSOR WITHOUT THE HOUSING.,0
Ordered a 6se and got a 7 to big,0
"HInky keyboard, a few keys didn't work, it's going back.",0
It just okay was expecting a better quality from reviews.,0
The rim of the glasses were very sharp and could lead to a cut on ones mouth. I have bought other brand plastic champagne glasses and they were much higher quality. I couldn't even use these and I had to even pay over $8 to return them.,0
"Mine did bloom about 90% but the green was only about 80% Fun, but I would not do it again.",0
Great for $10 Halloween wig hair. Not good for daily wear. Sheds A LOT!,0
"I bought this product for my wife and she ended up with a rash after a few days of use. She only used it for 3 to 5 hours a day. I did see there are other reviews stating this as well but there were some that said they saw results so we took a chance on it. Also, understand that if you want to return it, the shipping cost will be on you, so in the end I would of ended up losing more money. The shipping to return it would of been double the cost of the actual purchase. The good news is the seller is responsive, and did allow the return, hence the two star rating. But in the end it's cheaper for me to keep it and the wife said she will give it to her girlfriends to try if they are so interested.",0
"Yes, you get clean tasting water. But it does not last 300 fill-ups as the manufacturer claims. I fill up twice a day and I needed a new filter after a month! The longest a filter has ever lasted was 2 months. That's about 120 refills.",0
I've almost finished the bottle and haven't noticed any improvements.,0
"It's super thin fabric, and the elastic at the top rolls down. Does nothing at all to uplift. Does nothing at all for my figure.",0
Bought for friend. Too cheap looking,0
"Falls out all the time, every turn I make, it senses and causes it to open while I‚Äôm driving, my phone falls constantly. Great idea but the way that the ball auto rotates makes it hard to keep it in one position. It just rotates wherever it wants.",0
pretty but they didn‚Äôt last real long before they didn‚Äôt light up anymore,0
"These are small, fragile (my package arrived with two broken pieces), and amazingly lightweight, which is not what 'Triple Weighted' is supposed to mean. They did replace the broken pieces, but you definitely do NOT want these flimsy items for solid and enjoyable speed chess, for example.",0
"I purchased this for my son-in-law in January. First mistake! We should have known better to not purchase something that wouldn't be used for several months. He used it for the first time last week and said it was terrible. It was basically no help at all; it was better and faster to do the work manually. I would have loved to return the item but the time frame for a return understandably expired in February. Him and his dad clean a lot of fish, so admittedly they are probably really good at doing it manually. If you are very bad at it, this device could be an improvement for you.",0
the item is very soft. however the description is misleading. it's so small it's like a rag not a blanket which I was looking for. wish I could return.,0
This came as a good as new product but it ended up having broken pieces in it. It was promptly returned.,0
"It works, but I get a screeching noise whenever I use it and I'm trying to listen to music. I've tried to ignore it but it's pretty hard to get over. I only use it now if I really have to. I have also had problems where I plug everything in, then the audio still played out my phone's speakers. Now if I use it, I have to make sure my phone volume is off, and tinker with it until it's coming through the headphones.",0
"Nice, but not as pictured. Silver buckle, not gold!!",0
"Battery lasted just 4 days :( Weighing the exact same item has a 3-4 gram variance 2nd star because it is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for.",0
"I did not realize I paid double for only 12 cans, thought there was 24.",0
Didn‚Äôt pay attention to the size of the toy but i assumes for the price it would be bigger but it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs very small i could buy a bigger one for 9.99 at Walmart which i will do,0
"Quality is good. BUT, it stinks. Really! Washed the shirt three times and it still stinks like ammonia or something. It is going in trash. Money well wasted.",0
Cute but not sewn right. The lines were off and it was crazy tight around my calves and ankles and lose on my thighs,0
Just couldn‚Äôt get into it. Took a long time to take shape and feel like there was something to wait for.,0
"The idea is good, gives a softer sound than plastic pick which can be harsh on a ukulele... but I find the felt is difficult to grip and slides out of my fingers while playing.. still prefer my thumb best but oh the blisters after a rockin‚Äô out a few tunes!",0
"Couldn't get the lid off to turn the lights on, was afraid I would break the jar if I forced it, sent it back.",0
"It serves its purpose in my garage. It was super small. It came rolled tightly and due to the material it is made out of ,it took awhile for it to lay flat. Ultimately I went to Target and got another 1.",0
"Works great, light base, good seal, heavy cup. Its spinning mechanism is made of plastic though, it slipped one time and burned straight through it now it doesn't work anymore.",0
The belt shown in the picture is the color I was expecting. The belt arrived and is much darker. Disappointing as I was trying to match sandals that are exactly what the picture is.,0
"These may be dishwasher safe, but I don't recommend putting them in there: They rust. Also, they are the least user-friendly scissors I've ever owned. Operating them, even when cutting something as easy as wrapping paper, is a hand workout in itself. Just say ""no"" to these.",0
Not working it's on but sucks nothing outta the air I don't understand why it's so loud when running it's a nightlight now I guess,0
"great idea, if the suction would stay stuck to the mirror. i've twisted and tightened multiple times and it keeps falling off. i ended up just taking the bristle piece and hanging it from a robe hanger in my bathroom to use. i was going to return it due to the suction not working but the part that holds the hair to brush/dry works great -- if you can hang it from something.",0
Was not big enough for what I needed it for. Not bright enough.,0
"These are made of bamboo which at first is good, but then they tend to break off in between your teeth! Then you have to remove that by flossing, etc. They're a little different than a traditional wooden toothpick but will do in a pinch.",0
Shirt runs very big. I ordered a small and it made me look prego. Really didn‚Äôt like the feel of the fabric. Decided to return.,0
Beware that this is a 5lb bag. It‚Äôs nearly the same price as the much bigger bags and I accidentally ordered this.,0
I would imagine almost anyone buying something for a child is buying it as gift. I ordered two and each came separate in a plastic envelope rather than protecting them in a box. Amazon will likely delete this because they handled that part. Take your lumps Amazon instead of always deleting the problems that are your doing.,0
"Wasn‚Äôt what I needed , quality poor",0
"Horrible quality, come on and off randomly, maybe frequency splash over from other remotes. Some are too dim, burns thru batteries. Will not buy again.",0
Flakes off in a few hours. You're better off just using regular super glue.,0
it is not working now. Last less than two years.,0
Wasn't metallic gold like the picture. Wasn't very durable. Cracked in about 2 months. Outer shell totally fell off midway through the 3rd month.,0
"This seed arrived, after waiting over 3 weeks, in 2 unmarked white cloth envelopes. No identifying labels of any kind and no shipping bill. These seed could have been anything. I'm still waiting for the seed to germinate to see what I bought. Will never do business with this company again.",0
"to put one line on hold, you have to press 3 buttons. Not very smart.",0
"The building set might be fine but one of the reasons I bought it was that I liked the idea of a sturdy carrying case with a handle so that the set can be taken to Grandma's or to a friend's. With all the other toys and legos kids play with, there are so many small pieces, it's important to provide good storage for kids as they clean up and sort toys in their play areas. This is not good storage. The plastic box was smashed during shipping because it is made of thin material and I'm sure the handle wouldn't last long. I thought about just keeping the set and buying another sturdy tote but I believe the storage should have been better for the price, so I returned everything.",0
I like the feel and the costume but the zipper is bad going by see about a exchange,0
Does not work to well on plastic totes kind of disappointing,0
I have only had these pens for two weeks and they are already severely dry and low on ink. I believe I have received defective pens. I would purchased from another vendor for a better return policy.,0
"Jar it came in was all dented and damaged, unmarked and unlabeled, which made it look really cheap. If we were giving this as a gift, I would be embarrassed and would not give it. The seller needs to work in packaging so that it looks better and also does not get damaged in transit.",0
"Bought as an under belt for duty gun belt. It has one finished (or cut, trimmed) end. And one chopped off, unfinished , sharp cut and not rounded off end. The underside of my gun belt has the soft side of the Velcro, so I needed this belt to have an entire side of the hard side of the Velcro and it does not. The only full length side is the soft side of the Velcro. More than likely, I‚Äôm going to take this strap of leather, to a TAC store, and have hard side Velcro sewn onto it, and have it ‚Äúfinished‚Äù by them, or just return it and go buy a belt in person from the 5.11 Store. Very disappointed, since I have to qualify on the Range tomorrow, and don‚Äôt have any keepers to secure the belts together. Will use zip ties tomorrow, and fix it when I have time. Don‚Äôt waste your money on this p.o.c., take the time to buy a belt in person, like I should have done.",0
"i am not happy with this splitter at all, when i plug it in after about a min. it start buzzing. this continues until i unplug it.",0
"The mugs look nice. But don't expect to enjoy a hot cup of anything for long. The ceramic is so thin you can see light shining through the bottom portion of the mug. If looks are all you care about then these will do just fine. I prefer my mugs to keep my hot beverages hot though, so I would not buy again, nor would I suggest these to a friend.",0
Breaks at the lightning connector in less than a month,0
"Story was there with some character creation. Falls a little short in the end, reaching for a finale and conclusion.",0
Tired to drill out the broken bolt. The screw extractor broke off and now it's stuck in the car.,0
"I did a lot of research to find the perfect popcorn. This just did not taste right to me. Small, tasteless, and texture was off. I think popcorn may be like wine, and I need to find just the right one. In the meantime, I have ton of uneaten popcorn. Hmmmm, what to do!",0
It's a thick cover...seems like durable material. The reason why I don't like is that you couldn't cover the oven while it was attached to the 5# gas tank. The elastic cord would not expand enough. So with nothing attached to the oven it would probably be great but for my purposes I didn't like and couldn't use.,0
Incredibly tight fit. Almost pulled a muscle trying to fit them in. I don't know how effective they are yet. I want to give them a 3 month text.,0
Boxes are super small,0
"Did not realize this shipped from China, be prepared to wait forever to receive the item.",0
Upset because I have only had this for a few months and the wire is coming out. Can I get a replacement?,0
works good not for the kitty though she said it burned after a while,0
"I have no clue if they are working or not, but I still take them.",0
My fault for not doing better research. They were more like short shorts than what I was expecting. I'm too old to flash that much flesh.,0
I was very excited about getting these pens and I love about half of them. There are some that don‚Äôt write at all and a lot that will run dry while you‚Äôre using them. It makes it very difficult to color/draw with these. I‚Äôm strongly considering returning them :(,0
One of the USB ports doesn't function at all.,0
At first they were very nice but the almost the entire license plates have rusted out.,0
I like the color. It has a strange odor to it. It's a little rough.,0
Have not used it yet. However I did want to note that I received the product with the cap on wrong and it started leaking when I got it out of the box.,0
Poor reception for my truck. It does state that some vehicles will not get very good reception so I couldn‚Äôt really complain to much,0
Fortiflora had no odor to it when usually it has a pretty strong odor ? Have bought this product before and first time this has happened. Defective item? Not happy since I was out of the window period to return it.My cats won‚Äôt touch food with this FortiFlora on it when usually they love the FortiFlora.,0
"The skirt was terrible. It was a rumpled mess. Also, one of the flowers fell off the headband immediately.",0
"I have a big head - this barely fit me.....it was so tight that I won't be wearing it again. The bands need to be longer. I recommend getting an eye mask as opposed to this. Also when it's frozen it won't fit the contours of your face, it's like putting a peice of card board on your and trying to fit the contours of your face ... it just doesn't.",0
"I bought these to use on my flash set up, and even though is a small reciever and transmitter I end up changing these more often than I would like. Because of this I have to always carry back up batteries in my backpack which is not ideal. Would not recomend these batteries.",0
The back vents were cut uneven so they did not fit. I was only able to use the front ones.,0
The color was nothing like the photos,0
"I received this charger on October 25, 17. It did arrive in a timely manner which I was happy about because mine took a crap abruptly and I needed something quick. I did think it was well made looking and honestly look no different than the one I had received when I purchased my phone. It's now February and it's already broken. I was very disappointed that it lasted a mere months. I will say this time around I purchased one from my cellular service provider and it was four times more expensive but came with a year warranty. So if these are only lasting on average 3 months based off my experience then you might as well just go purchase the one for your phone from your cellular service company. It is a fast charger, and charge my phone as quickly as the original one. I was just bummed out at how it didn't last very long.",0
All I did was charge it. I seldom open that closet but it never came on. It was always dead.,0
This is a very fragile item. it doesnt come with a charger. It is slow to charge via USB. The official chargers are not more expensive. Why waste your money on this?,0
"Was sent without the straw lid so very disappointed with that. Otherwise, a great bottle.",0
"So, here I am thinking I will get a one pound bag of earl grey tea. I love Harney and Sons other teas. Their Earl Grey has to be good too, right? Wrong! The bergamot vanishes entirely when the tea is steeped. There is just a hint of the odor of it once you pour the tea. Disappointing, and I bought a one pound bag of it because I assumed it would be good, because the other teas from this brand are excellent. Also, my bag broke open in shipping because it was shipped in an envelope.",0
I thought that this would be bigger than it was and that the water would last longer. I was filling it at least every 3 hours which is a huge pain in the ass. Definitely diffuses well . feels kind of cheaply-made. Kind of disappointed in what I paid for it expected better for sure. Ended up buying two other ones because this one just didn't work like I thought I would would like to return it however it's past the return time,0
It's a very nice bag but much smaller than it looks in the picture. No returns on this item unfortunately,0
"Nothing fantastic. Curly, not very thick, freeze, long hair (Latin, our hair texture is different)",0
"very over priced for the size of the product, but my grandson loved it",0
"After getting lost, product arrived a week later than expected. When I opened the box and removed the Soak Off, both caps were loose. About a half inch from one bottle and 1/3 of the other bottle had spilled out during transit. I will be returning the product since I‚Äôm not getting all I paid for.",0
"Had the less than a month and now there flicking and one already quit working don‚Äôt buy them go for a more expensive brand that‚Äôs better, u get what u pay for lol",0
"I know I gave this product a 2-star rating, but trust me.....this is not based on function. The bottle does it's job flawlessly. However.....one of the main reasons I bought the bottle....is long gone. The wood grain finish immediately caught my attention....and within a few months of my purchase.....the bottle started peeling and flaking. At this stage....the bottle is almost peeled bare, and is quite embarrassing to travel with daily. So though it still ""works"", my love for it has been diminished.",0
"I dislike the product, because I used for one month and the product is not working good anymore. The resistances in the sides stopped to work and I could return, and need to send to a technical assistance to have a solution.",0
"These are so cool, but they are extremely fragile. It's impractical to actually use them, as they chipped immediately - I can't imagine them lasting beyond any meaningful curiosity or experimentation.",0
I was going to use these beautiful earrings for my cosplay of Elizabeth. Unfortunately These only lasted about 10 minutes...Drawn on with sharpie huh? Yeah don't think I didn't notice. The marks and patterns erased I was very disappointed because I did not even get to do this cosplay. I would never recommend this (PLEASE DONT BUY),0
Runs small (I wear a size 8 and the large that I ordered is tight) and is incredibly scratchy/itchy.,0
"Af first I loved these but about a month of a jacket hanging on a large hook, the adhesive gave out and the hook fell off the wallet",0
"This bin is way too large for my needs (storage of dry cat food on my countertop). I needed a smaller container for smaller quantities of dry food to have it handy to serve my cats' meals, which I have found and purchased.",0
Remote stopped working. Not as comfortable as other units.,0
I wasn't that happy with this flag I didn't like the material!,0
Unfortunately the smell of the product did not work for me. It gave both myself and husband migraines. To overwhelming for us. I am requesting refund back to my account. Messaged the seller.,0
I was pretty disappointed that each packet only makes 3oz of cocoa. It tastes good though so I just add it to my coffee,0
"We bought the desk(with the hatch) for our home office but was greatly disappointed. First, the product came one week later than was scheduled, one part came broken and after assembly, some parts such as the doors to came off since the screws wouldn't support the weight. I gave the desk 2 stars because of the good look of the desk. My suggestion, spend little more money and get a solid and durable desk. Don't waste your money or time on this.",0
Super cute but there isn‚Äôt enough slack to adjust for me to be able to get the harness on my cats. It looks like in other photos there is much more room to adjust the tightness of the harness but mine was much shorter and i could not see how they were supposed to get in.,0
"The boots are great to look at, but made less expensively than I would like.",0
"Does its job as toothpaste, but not provided good feeling as those a little more expensive.",0
Received broken. Pretty flimsy.,0
"I ordered this item twice. The first one that arrived was exactly as it appeared in the photo and in the description. It works well. In fact, I would give it four or five stars. Just so, after a couple of weeks using the first one, I ordered a second one for use when the other's in the wash. At ""Your Orders,"" I clicked on ""Buy it again"" but what arrived is different: the first one is turquoise, the second one is dark blue; the first one is made of a ""spandexy"" material, the second is more woolly; and most importantly (depending on the size of your head) the first one is, as described, 29"" long, the second one is 26"" long. Also, I noticed too late that the listing seller is a different name. Same description, same photo, same item number; two different seller names. And just now I noticed there is, on the same Amazon page, another item being offered like this one, same photo, same description, different price, different company.",0
I didn't like the recipes.,0
Did not have very clear directions and very difficult material to work with unsure if it was user error or perhaps the material truly is difficult.,0
"It does the job. But putting it into place, in the ground... it was very flimsy. 3 of the 4 broke on the stake no matter how we put it in.",0
"Arived broken, i fixed them then the audio went out in the right ear",0
Thought I would love these but the nose spring piece has already broken off. I am vey disappointed. Have not used them that much.,0
3 out of 4 failed within the first week. I think I still have one after a month or so.,0
It came to me with a low battery. Not even a month later it's completely dead.,0
"probably works with home stereo devices, but does NOT work with jvc car stereo head unit. plugged it into the USB connection and the bluetooth was choppy and cut in and out constantly. it may work with other head units, but not jvc.",0
"The left shoe is about correct. The right shoe is very tight, almost as if it was size smaller.",0
"I installed this battery pretty easily on a compatible MacBook Pro (Mid 2012) and it was great for the first week or so. After that, the MacBook was incredibly unstable and would not stay running (even connected to power) for more than an hour before crashing. I did a bunch of troubleshooting thinking my older Mac was starting to show it's age in other ways, but to no avail. As a last hail Mary effort, I ended up putting the battery I replaced back in to the machine and it has been stable since. I am unable to return this battery at this point, but I definitely would if I could. Pretty much a waste of time and money.",0
"Nice product, enough space to hold all of my essential accessories but the mesh tore away from the elastic after just 6 weeks of use leaving one pocket useless.",0
This cable is listed with a length of 1 foot. It is actually 10 inches which makes a difference if you want to use it to hook up a mini keyboard to a macBook Pro.,0
"While I really like the simplicity and concept of the La Luna white noise machine, I found the fan sound to be insufficient in volume. It simply doesn't get loud enough, even on the loudest setting. If the volume were louder, this would be a winner!",0
"Cannot pair both. Read the reviews about repair and followed the manual. Sent 2 emails to seller, but no response. Had high hopes seeing all the good reviews. I would like to like them, if they could work. Frustrating to not get a reply from the seller so guess I'll send them back and try another seller.",0
Ice cubes don't come out easily and the non-silicon part already broke.,0
"They look cool I guess, but they don't fit in earlobes properly. They stick out really far and look stupid. .",0
"After going thru all the prescribed cleaning procedures, it still did not stick! Expected more from such an expensive screen protector",0
"If you are looking for a moisturizer, this isn‚Äôt for you. It is too light.",0
"Sadly disappointed in this item. The locking lever does not hold the tray in place and I have to let the tray rest on my left leg to keep it from rattling with each keystroke. At first I thought maybe I didn't have the tray screwed on tight enough, but after double checking, everything I put together was good and tight. The mechanism that slides in and out and lets the tray tip is very loose. In this case the old adage holds true...you get what you pay for.",0
Very tight around ankles. Have ordered them before and they were fine...but this batch is hard for me to wear..,0
Don't dim enough... flicker at times but not always,0
Obvious sign aware the L key is not even visible has been marking with a pen already started return through customer service,0
It only kept my coffee warm for about 2 hours.,0
Two of the four cables were damaged upon arrival. I contacted the seller who informed me that they would send me a replacement. That was 6 weeks ago. I kept the two working cables because I didn't want to be bothered with the return process. I will not purchase from this seller again.,0
Disappointed that it does not keep my oatmeal warm for even two hours. I always use Thermos products. Have two for coffee and they keep my coffee piping hot from 7 am till noon. They keep iced coffee ice cold for more than 24 hours. I expected the same from this food container :(,0
nice colors but the stitching is terrible. I would not recommend this item. the stitching is at it's worst on the very top of the owl's head. very distracting.,0
"The overall alignment of this unit to not up to the mark . If you are ok with few misaligned drawers , the gaps between the drawers is not same",0
Pillow is very uncomfortable. Mine had a large lump of stuffing in the corner and the rest of the pillow was flat. I will not purchase this again.,0
"Seems to have good picture, but keeps glitching when playing blu-rays. Will need to exchange.",0
Very stiff doesn‚Äôt swim straight even when rigged straight has a tendency to spin. Tail action isn‚Äôt that great. Colors are ok,0
"I bought two of these. One fit great, the other one piece would not properly fit and lock into the watch. No good for use at all then.",0
This worked fine for 10 months and then wouldn't unlock with the proper code. The actual cable is very thin so it didn't take any time at all to use a hacksaw to cut it in half. Maybe that's why it's inexpensive?,0
"This was a great idea, but the magnet material is too thin. The magnets are always falling off the fridge and getting lost. I am very disappointed.",0
"Not smooth rolling. After sitting for awhile on a rolling desk chair, it makes indents in the mat that are difficult to roll out",0
"Unfortunately, these are only slightly better than nothing. They deflect some water but still allow cushions to get soaked with each rain. Probably will be ok for sun protection for non Sunbrella fabric cushions. We'll see.",0
Camera was shaky and made me dizzy. Extra star for the ending. Strange.,0
I'm disappointed I thought it would have actual glitter plus it doesn't look true to the pic mine came today and I gotta say I'm pretty disappointed but it will have to do because my daughter's birthday is next week.,0
This is not a remy human hair,0
"Love these earbuds so much I‚Äôve gone through several pairs over the last year or so. The fit is the best I‚Äôve had and that‚Äôs why I keep coming back to them. The sound is decent for the price, though I usually listen to podcasts rather than music. Batteries are not great but customer service is quite good. I‚Äôve had to replace several pairs but Anker has made it fairly painless to do so.",0
"It doesn‚Äôt actually freshen the air, but cute. I was really looking for a car freshener more than an ornament... thought these were adorable but they don‚Äôt freshen despite strong fragrance on pads. I‚Äôve had no broken parts like other reviewers and have had them for two months.",0
Not nearly enough light. My small standard size blacklight bulb was much better and from the Dollar store.,0
Colors and graphic are great but the size was way smaller than I expected. Wouldn't be big enough for a twin sized bed.,0
"This item was marketed as for the Mavic 2. The problem is the Mavic 2 and their batteries are larger than other Mavic models. Also, compared to other cases, this is thin plastic.",0
"Rail is bowed/bent ever slightly. Will not line up correctly. This is a high grade plastic/polymer, so not likely it occurred in shipping, but instead was a manufacturing defect. Not really usable unless it is put under high heat to attempt to straighten. That being said, quality of plastic/polymer is high grade and well finished. Just not straight...",0
Just okay. Fabric not comfy,0
"I purchased the three-pack, but only two of them work consistently. For one of them, I have to continually wiggle it to get it to deliver a charge. I know it's the cord because the charger device i attached it to for electricity has a light that indicates when it is receiving power. The braided cord must have come with a short in it.",0
The product spilled in package during shipment,0
"Well, I really like the product and I really want to be able to play it. The problem is, when I got it in the mail, it was missing the title deeds. I called the company that makes it and they exchanged it for me, but I just got the replacement in the mail and the same title deeds were missing. So frustrating.",0
"These feel cheap, like more like they should have been in the 20-30 dollar range. So yeah, these are a no go. The sound is uhh... That's okay. But if you have a big head, you're gonna suffer a great deal from how harsh of a clamp these have.",0
"Disappointed, I wasn't expecting high quality considering its a $25 no name brand bag. The leather exterior was as pictured and seems to be pretty durable, but the inside lining of this bag resembles something I would expect at the dollar store. It feels/sounds like paper, I won't be using it knowing it will tear within days. A set of keys could tear through easily if not placed in carefully. I'm also afraid to put my cell phone in it because of how rough the matieral is, and the sharp edges of zippers. So I've learned my lesson with online purse shopping. On the bright side, my 4 year old niece now has the nicest dress up bag the internet has to offer.",0
Lacked very much taste but worth the try,0
"I really liked this diaper bag because it has the long strap to use as a cross body as well as the book bag feature. However, it didn‚Äôt last. I used it maybe 3 times (and it wasn‚Äôt even full) and the book bag strap started to pull at the seam. I was unable to find a contact for a replacement so now I‚Äôm just stuck with a diaper bag that‚Äôs on the verge of falling a part. Pretty bummed.",0
"This just isn‚Äôt the same as what I‚Äôve bought at a salon. It doesn‚Äôt come out as a foam, more as a liquid. And it doesn‚Äôt smell right. It seems to work ok with my hair but I have to put it in my hands first and then rub it on my roots. Will not be purchasing again.",0
"missing one screw, it wasted my time, I have to return it",0
"Too dark,looks more maroon.",0
"Of the 12, I only have 5 left in less than a months use. The magnets are brittle and will easily snap and break. The finish also is wearing off. I would not recommend these magnets. They are magnetized and will hold papers so they got that going for them...",0
Looks very thin. I have very thick hair and the clip ins are not blending at all. It will work for thickening an updo and once my hair grows out a bit more I can use them to add some volume.,0
I wore the weight trainer twice and there were wiring that started to poke out and stab me in the side. It was fairly uncomfortable and it wasn't that easy to hide under clothes. I wore it to help with my homecoming dress this year and I had to take it off and throw it away in the bathroom because the wiring fell out and it kept rolling up and it was really itchy. I couldn't stand wearing it any longer.,0
"Someone said it works on the bottle from Costco, but mine's didn't work. It didn't fit completely and the water leaked. I will return it.",0
I bought this in January 2018 and it's just stopped working after less than 5 months. The warranty is only for 90 days. Wish I had bought a better quality product.,0
Timer works fine easy to use. It is only 2 prong when you plug into outlet and it doesnt seem secure enough.,0
"We love this lotion but one of them burst all over the others! It's super messy, not too mention wasted all that lotion! This item should have been packaged better! I'm so annoyed!",0
"My home has 8 foot ceilings and the clock was on a self maybe 4 feet from the floor. The focus adjustment hit the stop before the digits were clearly focused (the numbers were fuzzy), Setting the radio was frustrating, I never was able to do it. The light from the projector was bright. Too bright for us, the night it kept us awake and not bright enough in the daylight to see it. It has two settings of brightness but I could not really tell the difference in brightness between the two..If you wanted a night light too you might actually light this aspect. The projection did not show whether the alarm is on or not which my last projection alarm clock had. I found this a little annoying. There really wasn't enough description for me at least to ascertain these issues. The clock did work OK. I returned it and ordered a different one..",0
"I have a bunch of these and they're all really great. I would give them all 5 stars in terms of quality - comfort and look. However, the orange/grey has given me a rash on my wrist because instead of a smooth metal surface like all the others the reverse side of the little nub which is this round disc is made of cheap plastic that has given me a red sore spot on my inside wrist. so get the other colours but pass the orange/grey.",0
Sent first drill back for exchange. the second drill had the same problem clutch would not engage until set to 8 and then it would lock in with no slip. sent the second one back for refund Do not like leaving negative reviews but this is not what I expect from a dewalt tool. I use them every day for work and these are not the quality I'm used to,0
"Just took it out of the box today and noticed the carrying strap is ripped. Seems like a nice chair, but I‚Äôm not happy about the strap. It would be nice if the company could replace the strap without having to ship back the chair.",0
Sharp and poor cover design. Hard to get it back on and very apt to slip and cut you. Also has small rust spots. Nice looking but its gotta go back.,0
"The writing is not streamlined, but I didn't see any typos. At first, I thought it was a military space story. I was soon disappointed to find out it was a story about a game junkie. The character was not likable and his wife was even worse. In the end, he got more than he bargained for trying to keep his addiction alive. Honestly, I enjoyed the space battle at the beginning and the rest of it, not so much. It wasn't my cup of tea. Thanks, but no thanks for any future episodes/books in a series of this story for me.",0
"does not come with all dlc just 4, beside that its a good game",0
"Worked well for a few weeks, then started to be very sensitive. Went off when my pup was completely still and asleep. Shocks and vibrates from other dogs' noises and from the jingle of dog tags on their normal collar . Quite disappointing- was looking forward to having a humane bark collar!",0
it simply does not work. The Transmitter and the Receiver particularly have to be next to each other in order to work. But that just defeats the whole purpose. I wish I could just return this item,0
"While the presentation is very nice, these lashes are impossible to get on. The lashes are not curved enough to allow them to lay on your natural lash line so that the second/ under lash can connect with the attached magnets",0
"So, this wrench slips. I couldn't get it to grip anything unless I put a thin piece of cloth between it and what I was trying to wrench. Not sure if you are supposed to do that, but I really needed to wrench something on something. Left me cold though if I needed to wrench something ""off""!",0
"I think this fucks up some of the internal hardware. When I plug my external hard drives into this, there are always errors transferring footage, opening footage, etc. However, when I use an adapter that I bought from the apple store, it works just fine - no issues. I've had broken hard drives due to this thing - it just messes up something internal and won't read correctly. I still kept it for the HDMI plug in though.",0

The built in speakers are of bad quality and only some vinyls sound good. Extremely disappointed with the quality of the speakers.,0
"Feels flimsy, and the spinning feels a bit uncontrolled, considering you‚Äôre doing work that requires control. Also, the design on top of the turntable is grooved. Take note of the lines radiating out from the center, all the way out to the edge; if, with icing, your cake is basically the same width as your cake board (it‚Äôs what I had on hand), then the cake comb sits on the turntable itself and catches in the grooves every single time, making a smooth finish impossible, no matter what size cake you put on there.",0
I thought it was the large tube that I usually buy..the price sticker on the 2 pack had a $5 price sticker yet it cost alot more and not sure why. Otherwise it is a good product. It is a much better deal to buy it and Bath and Body Works!,0
"Nice belt at first, but unfortunately as you wear the belt the front gets scuffed up and starts coming apart where the leather slides into the buckle. This exposes the inner part of the leather and looks bad.",0

"I'm normally very easy to entertain. This movie I struggled with. Seemed very disjointed. It was like they had a much longer story they wanted to tell, but chopped a ton of it out leaving many scenes without context. Acting was pretty good. CGI sets were a bit poor in many places. If this was based on a book I'd want to read it. Like others have said it has a neat concept.",0
"This case does NOT work with the Samsung wireless fast charger. It will charge for about three seconds then stop. I'm using the actual Samsung charger - not some other brand or generic. The only reason I bought this case is because others said it worked in the reviews and answers. This is a waste of money for me because without wireless charging, I won't use it. On the plus side - the leather feels and looks nice.",0

Too big and bulky. Seriously who can fit this in their pocket?,0
Definitely NOT good for lining up your beard and stash. Doesn‚Äôt cut close enough to the skin.,0
"I got this as just a fun fidget toy to play with, and for the most part, it did its job. But then it broke. So, I got another one for Christmas. That one also broke. The first one lasted about 2 months, the other one lasted 1 month. I would recommend another trainer's balisong because this one is, obviously, cheap and doesn't last that long.",0
"I bought this set for my son for Christmas because he is a huge Dinotrux fan, unfortunately two of the trucks were broke by Christmas night. The metal parts are well made, but the plastic is just junk.",0
"No spoilers intended, but some ideas must be presented to explain my rating. I read the collected edition knowing full well the outcome of the series, and I just can‚Äôt help wondering if this was even a story that needed telling. Superheroes are supposed to be better than us. Does it help to see so many of them broken? Even worse, what good does it do to break a representation of hope? I‚Äôd would have rather had a story rebuilding the DCU rather than destroying it.",0
Flannel is a nice weight and for that I decided to keep it. I had to cut off the sleeves and remake because the armhole was way too small and the sleeves were attached backwards. I usually wear a size L or XL but bought a 3XL because reviews said product ran small.,0

"Update on this delonghi heater This past December 2017 The heater caught on fire. The plastic melted into my carpet and damaged the rug and it has to be replaced. The electrical mechanical smoke smell still lingers after several weeks of trying to clean walls, cabinets and furniture. I googled delonghi heaters catching on fire and found references to this problem along with recalls. I called delonghi several times and was put on long hold several times. Promises to return my phone call did not occur. Each time I call I am told it is being handled by a different person. Well it is sure safe but it takes several hours to heat up and starts to warm up my sewing studio. Actually I have to put it near me so I feel a little bit warm. I live in the sc.

"bad quality. The costumer service is so bad, I requested a replacement, and it take forever.",0
i mean it‚Äôs great and all but it smells really bad. like really really bad. if i would‚Äôve known what it smells like i would‚Äôve ordered it somewhere else,0
Doesn't stay cold long.,0
This case is great but there is plastic that goes over the buttons on the side of the iPhone and it is very hard to use them through the plastic. Would be so much better if it was a cutout so you could easily use the phone features. The case itself it nice but wouldn‚Äôt recommend as it makes the phone harder to use.,0
Never seen a butterfly feed from it. Have seen a hummingbird go to it but it doesn't hold much liquid to keep the hummers interested.,0
"Disappointed, it is cheap looking.",0
This is a super cute shirt and very good quaility but extremely way to big. I can nor even wear it and I bought 2 of them.,0
Didn't work well for my application on semi trucks,0
Good idea but doesn't clean because the wheels don't even touch the pads. They just ride up on the rails.,0
The top fits slightly loose and the bottoms are a bit to small. The top has no support or built in bra. The bottoms are pictured as boy shorts but in all actuality are more like panty bottoms. I gave it two stars because the design of the top was very nice.,0
Im a size small and that's what I ordered. Tried it on and it fit like a large.,0
Didn't do anything for my hair or nails. I really think the positive reviews are from people that just have naturally fast growing hair. Save your money.,0
If you put a bag the lid wont click and fall off. Cute but quality sucks.,0
This bubble wrap is very fragile. Sometimes the bubbles pop just from the pressure of handling it during wrapping items. I would not buy it again.,0

Nice umbrella while it worked. Now it won't stay open.,0
The lotions is too liquidy and does not apply nicely. It leaves me sticky. I would like to return but it looks like that‚Äôs not optional.,0
"These chargers look great and they worked well at first! All three stopped working on me within a month of purchase, and my typical phone charging cords last me around a year or more. Seriously disappointed in this product.",0
case is kinda hard to put on and off and even with the protective plastic case over my phones screen it still lets dust and dirt in. often i'm on my phone and there's a little spot i try to wipe away only to realize it's under the plastic coating. feels like i'm constantly pulling the case apart to clean the phone. the only reason its getting 2 stars is because so far i've dropped my phone like 10 times and it seems to hold and protect just fine.,0
It‚Äôs too big and takes up too much space.,0
The push buttons are so sharp they cut into the wrist. Very uncomfortable.,0
"I have curly hair, the lotion is a little to heavy for me like leaves a residue. And shampoo seems to feel dry after use the conditioner is okay but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again.",0
"Decent water bottle, terrible lid design. I used it no more than three times before I accidentally (and lightly) dropped it. The rigid plastic lid cracked instantly which rendered the whole thing essentially useless. I wish this brand offered replacement lids so I could keep using it. Either way there are better more rugged bottles out there. I would not recommend this product.",0
"Loved it at first but less than 4 months later, the coloring is chipped on the top around the lid and started to chip on the bottom. The lids to buy with it aren't consistent quality (I have a straw lid). I had to replace one already because the rubber part of the tip of the lid was torn up. The lids aren't that expensive so not a big deal. What I really hate is that after less 4 months of use, it is now holding the taste of water flavoring I used for 2 days. It's been scrubbed and the water not only has a lingering taste of the flavoring, but also a lingering smell of it. Stainless steel should never hold smells or tastes. I'm just glad I didn't spend that much money on it. I'll be buying a hydroflask to use.",0
"While this plug collection is great if you are traveling to multiple countries because of the selection, the adaptor themselves are terrible. When plugging in my phone charger, curling iron etc. the fit wasn‚Äôt snug so every plug kept falling out of the adapter. I wouldn‚Äôt waste your money.",0
Diapers are great for the ones that are not dysfunctional. Everyother diaper tag on the baby's right hip is made into the diaper so I can not use them!! That's 24 unusable diapers and wasted money!,0
"My leaf did not rust unlike most reviews and the suction cup worked on my regular fish bowl (not a tank). However, I believe all of the reviews that talked about the leaf not being safe for fish because our fish died a few weeks later after installing it. It‚Äôs hard to say if the leaf was the cause of the death but it could be a contributing factor. Plus, my fish never took interest in the leaf even when I tried putting food above it like recommended. Luckily this wasn‚Äôt too expensive otherwise I would have wasted my money. I don‚Äôt recommend buying it but if you do plan on buying it, I‚Äôd say consider the precautions",0
It‚Äôs a beautiful photo however the puzzle was missing many pieces and could Not be completed. It‚Äôs very frustrating to spend that much time to uncover not all the pieces are there.,0
Smudges by the afternoon. Looks like I have raccoon eyes. Very disappointed.,0
These smart plugs work great some of the time. The rest of the time they flicker don‚Äôt connect or simply don‚Äôt work. Buy other more reputable plugs.,0

"This was an Amazon prime order, received in a ziplock bag. Not impressed at all, and not sure I should be using it.",0
I didn't care for the loose fit of the boots on the legs and how the top falls down a bit. They aren't bad but I purchased a different & cheaper pair and was so much more satisfied and impressed by them.,0
Wallet it absolutly beautiful. Zipper on coin pouch on back never stayed closed all the way though.,0
"The wrong item was sent, the seller did refund me so good return customer service.",0
the stand is too flimsy. needs more support.,0
"I'm not so sure that the pee is suppose to get in the toilet but it does. My son uses it and whenever he pees, it hits the tongue part of the toilet seat basically where it hangs. I thought it was suppose to prevent it from getting it on the actual toilet but it still somehow drips onto the toilet seat and I would have to clean it every time I take it off which is really tedious. It would be nice if they made that tongue part longer so it doesn't splatter all over the toilet seat.",0
"I washed it a couple and the threading came loose. I don't know if it is just the one that I was sent, or if all of their towels were like that. Not impressed by the quality.",0

It didn‚Äôt rlly get my blackheads out it just made them stick out without it sucking the blackheads,0
Case snapped after less than a month. Really disappointed,0
Battery died about 3months after purchasing. Had to buy a replacement battery. Aside from that the phone seems to be working fine. This was bought for my daughter to be able to call me when she got in from school so it does the job. Wouldn't recommend if you're looking for a fast device or for gaming. And be aware you may have to buy a new battery.,0
The product was packaged poorly (thrown in a plastic bag-not boxed). Many pieces were broken.,0
"I didn't think I would need 2 but one was defective, very scratchy when it was moved. I replaced it with the othe cord and it works fine.",0
Light weight flexible sides and under sized latches. Might be good for your hobby or sewing kit but certainly not made for garage tools. Update: After using this tool box for several weeks I have discovered it is worse than I originally thought. With tools in the bottom the sides bow out so far the top tray falls inside the box.... it's junk. I'm going back to my old box with a cracked hinge... it is still stronger than this box. This one will be added to the dumpster.,0
"I had read that with these kinds of devices you have more success with males dogs which I have a male dog so thought i'd give it a go. The first two days he sniffed it real good but it did NOT trigger a urine response from him. Now, days later he pays it absolutely no attention. So it's a nice idea but I think these things are very dog gender, breed and personality dependent as to if they'll work for you or not. At least they're not very expensive so if it doesn't work you're not out a whole lot of money.",0
"I like that it leather and that it has a magnetic flap, I don't like that the bottom is closed completely, it would be nice to have the two finger holes on either side, the thing that I dislike about it the most is that putting a iPhone SE in it is like putting a cup of flour in a 5lb bag, it's so big and in the way, I am going to watch for something that will fit the (iPhone se/with a otterbox) better",0
These coins are very small so I returned it wasn't that cool,0
Nice but not worth the price. Very flimsy. Can come apart very easily. The thin burlap threads right away came off.,0
"Received this package - everything was in it except one package of cups, I only received 12 instead of 24. Not sure how to contact amazon to get this fixed...?",0
Nice concept but it ripped in half within the first two months of use.,0
These are NARROW. Will be returning.,0
Not as good as Wholefoods 365 brand. This product seems to be much more dilute so you have to use 2x as much.,0
I tried these but I found that they were difficult to swallow and harsh. My husband didn't have any issues but I didn't feel great taking these.,0
Product is very flimsy.. Side holders handles broke. Clasp to look other bags broke..,0
One didnt work at all and one broke after 2 weeks of use.,0
I like the compartments in the bag but I was really really disappointed that the zipper broke on the first day. I am able to fit all the things I need for both my 2 year old and 6 month old in the bag still debating on going through the trouble and returning it.,0
"The color is great, but the view screen is unclear.",0
I like the case but the screen protector was cracked upon arrival. Don‚Äôt want to risk having my phone without a case for a day so I will just end up ordering a new screen protector. Bummer.,0
"Doesn't go to edge. If you put a case on it, it will push protector off.",0
I found thickening my dreams and ordered from Amazon but this find I erred and ordered the wrong one. It's good but not my dream pen. I like the silver barrel 207 retractable more.,0
"I bought these for driving; they are ok for that. They don't change very dark in the sun and they stay gray inside, so they can't be depended on to transition. One of the nose pieces broke off, so I ordered a second pair. I have the same issue with the frame. The quality is poor. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for.",0
They were melted by the time they reached my house.,0
Like the look of the cup but so far 2 out of 4 habe leaked from the bottom....,0
The 1st cracked immediately after applying it to my phone. The second one was chipped on the bottom.,0
Didn't hold up more than 2 months as my 9 year olds lunch bag.,0
I thought it would be bigger in the inside but overall it does the trick.,0
Fits good ... weird material though,0
"While it does help fill in the gaps, it can leave your finger nails very dirty if you forget and touch you hair. Make sure to wash it out before going to bed. It leaves you hair and scalp very dirty.",0
"Gave to my wife for Christmas. Now that its been 6 months, we find the matts wear quickly.",0
Nice and warm... But no fly??? Men need a fly...,0
"This thing is just ok. I've had it barely over a week and only stamped about 5 letters and the ink is already looking kinda tired. There's a little plastic window piece on top of the stamp that shows what the stamp is (i.e. the window snaps shut and holds in a square piece of paper with ""RETURN TO SENDER NOT AT THIS ADDRESS"" written on it so you don't confuse it with other stamps) and that window has already broken off and won't snap back into place. So my verdict is that if you buy this plastic thing that is cheap, you're getting exactly what you should expect: a cheap piece of plastic.",0
"I have been finding it difficult to find some decent truck seat covers that don't cost an arm and a leg. I thought these would be just what I needed until I went to put them on and found out that our truck's head rests cannot be removed. Haven't decided yet whether I will be returning these or if I want to take the time to make some alterations to the seat cover so I can get it over the head rest. Seller should mention that the head rest needs to be removed to be able to install properly. I do like the purple color :) I have yet to find out if the seat cover actually fits the seats in our 2018 Chevy Silverado 1500. Amazon claims these fit, but I haven't been able to try them out yet.",0
Very cheap and the net is too low. It's fine for children,0
case doesn't stay closed. paint wears off.,0
2 stars only because they were very comfortable. They only lasted 3 weeks in the steel mill I work in before the soles were completely melted.,0
The rod looks and feels good.. however the rod tip was broken. Very disappointed.. hope my replacement comes soon.,0
"Labeling standards require that ingredients be listed by most prevalent (highest concentration) to lowest concentration. There is more salt, MSG, and sugar in this stuff than actual dehydrated chicken broth. In fact, chicken is all the way down in 7th place on the list",0
Be careful lifting these trays by the corners even if it‚Äôs empty. They will break apart. 3 of mine broke just holding them empty.,0
It is too heavy to keep it on.,0
This glass is all scratched and I will have to replace it. I have purchased this brand several times for other phone models. I have the same brand on my v30+ and it is excellent This glass for the Moto g7 is not good.,0
stopped working after 11 months. Light comes on but no motor.,0
"The ones that worked were great, but about half didn't work at all brand new out of the packaging.",0
"Lovely but upon inspection, the chin decal is missing from the yellow & black mug. Also, you can't see the forehead decal on the black mug b/c it is dark blue.",0
These are so thin they break very easy. Almost half of them broke using them in a party decoration. Found them elsewhere half the price and got double the amount.,0
These are very crappy markers. they dry out and not much variation in the colors. Disappointed.,0
"As the headline says, the knob is not rigidly attached to the tank-side threaded adapter. I guess this is in case someone wants to use a wrench instead of the plastic knob (why would you though?). Either way, I feel like the plastic knob should have at least snapped into position so it didn't easily slip off the end. I can't help but feel like I'm going to loose the knob within a year...",0
"The multiple piece design of the case does not stay together at all. While it looks great, it is constantly in pieces. I'll be shopping tonight for a one piece case with a similar look. However, I was very impressed by the fast, friendly customer services representatives who have offered to replace this with another model. Their desire to ""get it right"" is an excellent example of great customer service.",0
Leaking and bathroom flooded,0
Cheap feel. Frayed after Day 1. Highly disappointing.,0
I just bought 2 for my horse troughs. One of them has already quit working. It didn't even last 30 days and I got the higher wattage to help keep water from freezing. Very disappointed.,0
"Washed blankets in cold water and the black ink bled in certain places. Other than that, the blankets are as expected.",0
I got one thin branch,0
Too small and cheap.,0
These work great ONLY when I am home. When I leave they show ‚Äúoffline‚Äù and I can‚Äôt control them or see if they work.,0
"If you are supposed to squirt this in your toilet bowl and let it sit for ""however"" many minutes, it is a huge disappointment. It is so thick that it will run down but not spread, and you must use a brush to spread it. That incorporates water from the toilet bowl itself and undoes the idea of letting it sit on the surface. I much prefer sprays that actually will cover all the area in the toilet bowl, under the rim, etc. I will not buy this again.",0
The screen protector doesn't cover the entire screen. Very good packaging and presentation though,0
"Not as durable as more expensive brands. Handles are not 'cool' . I found the 12 fry pan to rise in the middle, pushing the food to the sides. I didn't know the lids came with vent holes for steam, not a feature I appreciate for every use. Steam build up is good for most of my cooking. I believe the page showed Brazil to be the manufacturing company, when in reality it was China. Im not at all thrilled with Chinese stainless. Too Cheap quality. And hence, the cheap price. Live and learn. Please change the page showing country of manufacture to reflect CHINA, NOT BRAZIL, Thank you.",0
Very uncomfortable.. couldn‚Äôt make it stay in place. Way too big for airplane seat ! Unfortunately couldn‚Äôt return it due to the fact that my overseas trip was more than 30 days long!,0
"these were a gift, and were too small. I had to go out and purchase locally",0
These are not very good back scratchers mostly because they have splinters on them that should have been filed down better. They are otherwise sturdy and they were appropriate in length.,0
"I have several issues with this endoscope that caused me to return it: 1) There are two laws of civil engineering: F=MA and ""You can't push on a rope."" This device violates rule #2. It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The ""magic claw"" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for ""flexible grabber"" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient. There are a few things I liked about this device: 1) It's fairly inexpensive 2) The camera is decent 3) The light is good unless it gets covered in gunk 4) I found it fairly easy to connect",0
The only real pockets are the back ones but they're tiny. And no belt loops,0

The book is great. Would have made a good present but it was delivered all bent out of shape. Tossed it and am now going to town to buy something else....,0
Looks and feels like there's no protector installed but these things chip very easily. The 3rd one broke the same day I installed it. Worthless! Hope I can find a vinyl alternative and not tempered glass.,0
"These wireless earbuds are ok, don't fit too well in my ears, and seem too easy to lose, I think im going to pass on wireless airbuds all together.",0
this is heavy. the tripod isn't that great and actually is the heaviest part.,0
I originally bought theses to workout in. The first two to three weeks were fine the battery lasted forever and I had no issues. One day the headphones died early during my run. I charged them the next day and they lasted a less amount of time. Since then they have been dead and I can‚Äôt seem to charge them. I have tried the cord that came with the head phones along with several other types of cords and no luck. I can‚Äôt charge the head phones and they‚Äôre worthless. Spend a little extra and get some good quality workout headphones.,0
Cheap sheet. Started pilling immediately and 5 months later it‚Äôs too pilled to sleep on because you can feel all the little bumps.,0
Like the strings but hear are not LED lights. Need to return.,0
At first it worked really well. About two weeks after my dog wearing it he went out and it was raining.when he came in the house it was beeping and vibrating. He couldn‚Äôt figure out what was going on and I felt really bad. It works well as long as it doesn‚Äôt get wet I guess.,0
Only had it a week and true to un clasp it and it broke,0
This mouse or its cord died just as the 1-year warranty expired.I would give it NO stars but do not have that option. Hate is a strong word (1 star) but I definitely don't recommend this product.,0
Product arrived with no documentation: shipping paper or instructions for use sheet. Bottle does have Dosage Guidelines in tiny print.,0
I was pretty happy with the device until i noticed that it wasnt completely cutting power entirely to devices when shut off (have a led light plugged into it and device is barely still on) Due to this i am giving it two stars. Very happy otherwise,0
The bars of the heart and the hanging design were two diffrent bar sizes.,0
I have bought this for last year from bodybuilding.com. Love the stuff usually. Amazon had it and wanted quick shipping so ordered from here. It tastes nothing like what I have repeatedly ordered from other provider!!! Generally love it but not this order!! Looks legit packaging but not even close for flavor and quality.,0
"Paired with the Phillips flood LEDs. These cause very minor flickering but pronounced flashing. They don't hold the brightness steady. There is also significant dead space in the lower range of adjustment. I think most people are not too picky. Also, dinner if there fluctuation is the electrical system itself. Ultimately these just work ok with LEDs.",0
This machine is nowhere near as good as my old Beehive Blender. This one struggles with smoothies and my old one didn't. This one overheats and I have to stop and stir the mixture so it will blend. Not good at all.,0

"This review is for the refurbished- lesson learn, buy a new one. The dial was working up to the 6 level and from there to 10 there was no increase in power. Rotor started to smell like a burnt engine after 3 times of use.",0
"So much smaller than I anticipated. Used it for ""parts"" to a different one I bought locally. Cute, will pay attention to size details",0
Basic headphones - noise cancelling virtually non-existent. Would not have bought if I had a chance to try first. Just a basic set of headphones - look elsewhere if you need noise cancellation.,0

"I ordered this recently and I thought I should give a balanced review. First, the product is cleverly designed and extends the practical life of older Bose headphones by making them Bluetooth enabled. Certainly they can be used in a wired mode, but that has become less and less convenient. The product fits well and is unobtrusive. It sounds fine. It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors. In the material, it says ""Built-in long lasting battery, charging 2 hours for enjoying up to 15 hrs music playtime or talk."" so I thought the battery would be fine. It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: ""Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that. And if the music is louder, the battery power will be lost more fast. Thank you "" So I was disappointed. If battery life is a priority for you, keep this in mind.",0
Not very good for 6 year olds small arms! Worked great for sprinkler but couldn‚Äôt use for pool or bath due to the arm opening was too large.,0
"Bought this product as a replacement to the factory screen protector. From the start there were issues, even though some were minor I might as well list all of them. 1. Box has the instructions but they had a giant product sticker covering all of it. I didn't need the insturctions, but this could be difficult for other people who might not know how to. 2. The edges are not smooth and beveled so mine already cracked with less than 2 weeks of use. I have normal items in my pocket such as keys my phone. 3. Case made a slight sticky noise when typing or using the phone, I just drowned out the sound eventually. 4. Glass seems to be a fingerprint magnet. Just after the application of the new screen I noticed how all the touches appeared on the screen. Overall. I will use the second one since I got two, don't want to waste money. Will most likely by a factory one and spend the extra $$. Only reason I replaced it was because the original screen protector cracked doing its job.",0
My toes are always cold in the winter. These do not fit in any of my shoes or boots. I do not recommend.,0
"I love the color red and the options this K-cup had. There were a few things I had problems with. One mine was delivered Nov. 24 By February 24 the light option showing that the cup was being filled with the lid down went completely out . So we can put a pod in the maker , shut the lid and its not going to show any options at all. Sometimes it will put out hot water , some times not. I just missed the return window. Wasted money. Another thing I was not crazy about was the water holder isn't easy to refill when the coffee maker is on a kitchen counter but under a cabinet. IN order to fill it up you have to pull it out. This will be my very first negative review as I am a very positive person and always give great feedback but I would not want anyone else to buy one and have it go out within three months.",0

It also dries up some wh, This stuff is very thick. Then you leave it on and it dries up and leaves a cake layer on the skin that you can clean off with a moist towel. It also dries up somewhat matte- like toothpaste- instead of dewy. I have used better hydrating and moisturizing products.",0
"When it works, I enjoy it. You cannot resume listening as advertised. Stops in the middle of a CD for no reason. Goes through batteries quickly.",0
Very pretty but very small. It won‚Äôt fit my wrist.,0
Doesn‚Äôt work. Used the base and dye multiple times and it barely colored anything. Takes two hours to dye multiple times just to get any color. I don‚Äôt have the time to sit around two hours every time I need to tidy up my goatee. Not worth the money,0
"Not great. I had a flexible screen cover that was too tacky to the touch, so wanted a hard cover. This cover is small by comparison, which leaves an edge that actually gathers a lot of dust. Not to mention that edge is where the adhesive is, so there's no getting rid if the dust. This all makes it blatantly obvious that there is a cover on the phone. The adhesive at the edge is the only adhesive, too. Which leaves the cover with gaps- now touch points are inaccurate. Typing on a touch screen is hard enough, now I have to ""push"" hard to record taps. All of the cutouts are in the edge as well, not surrounding the home button, camera, etc. And the fit isn't good around them either. Does it work? Yes, it protects the screen. But not blending into the phone is annoying. Maybe a hard cover is really hard for a curved screen phone, but I'd keep looking for better if I were you. I'm going to ...",0

"Even local FM stations are hard to receive, and there are a great many spurious noise peaks that are not real signals.",0
Great however small for the average size wrist. Not sure of we received an exceptionally small band. Great product but wish it came with additional links. Will have to return sadly.,0
"I purchased it for a small ""add-on"" gift for a christening. Disappointed because I thought it was embroidered and not a transfer. For that price it should have been",0
First day clip broke off. The case itself seems to be okay but they need to improve the clip aspect (there wasn't any way it could be fixed) busted right off it seems to be an inferior grade of plastic . Disappointed in that as I work in construction and have to leave my phone around and that defeats the initial reason I bought one.,0
"I've only had these flip flops for one month and I really liked them up until now. They fit well, look cute, and are reasonably comfortable. But after only one month of wear, they are falling apart. The top layer of the foot bed is peeling off like old paint. I'm really disappointed, because they were almost $30 and they lasted significantly less time than the cheap $7 flip flops I used to get at Payless that would last me one year. Not worth the money.",0
the key broke from the center disk. I was a winding my heavy spring mantle clock. I can still use the next size up so glad it had a work-around.,0
"I genuinely wanted to enjoy this book - but in the end I have to say I finished it because I started it not because I enjoyed it. Like another critic, I read the original Thrawn novels and loved them. I bought Zahn's previous Thrawn novel (kindle and audio CD) - I absolutely loved the story and loved the characters. I've reread the book and re-listened to he CD several times. I don't know whether anticipation for this book coupled with a high expectation, given the successes of the previous novels had an effect, but this one just seemed lacking. The sad part is the reading experience reminded me of how I feel when early into watching a film you realize the movie is poor. As I settled into reading the book, I felt similarly. Read it if you're a die-hard fan but don't expect much.",0
"It's cute, but i have a feeling it going to last a week. My almost 4 year old likes to play with things, even when told not too. Very flimsy, and not designed to be played with. Remote back fell apart before even used. If you have an older kid, that won't play with it, then would work.",0
"This wasnt at all worth the price!!! There are holes after its put together, the sides are permanently concaved in, the light strip falls off every time you move it and the tripod was broken when I received it. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the price was still pretty cheap.",0
Very disappointed. I thought that this coolers were going to stay cooler longer because of the gel but it really doesn‚Äôt make a difference with the ones that are filled with water. This ones melt within a few hours inside of an insulated lunch bag. Also the yellow one bursted with it first use. I did check if it was water and definitely is gel. The colors are not as bright as the picture shows. Honestly I do not recommend this coolers for the price!,0
The product was beyond its use by date.,0
"Not the waves I was expecting. Oh well, it was only $10.",0
The tail constantly comes off. Not bad but frustrating ..,0
"Can't belive this cost what it does. Used a few times last year, stored in heated storage, then one use this season and it's now flat. Poor quality.",0
It bends and it is definitely not sturdy. Would return it if I could.,0
The product looks very good...but sadly it came all broken,0
Not as good as I expected,0
my dogs wont even try it.,0
Hate the cheap packaging. Came exactly how it looks in the bag. For almost $8 very dissatisfied with the white fuzzies coming out the ends of the shoelaces.... Ughh,0

"Great for the switch , love that it's still easy to dock it. Great especially for the price. Only problem is, that the screen protector didn't stick well on one side no matter what I tried, watched the video and everything.",0

If the seller would get a 3/8"" comb sent to me that would certainly change my review.",0
"The box came as it is. Torn , taped, shabby. Needed it as gift... very disappointed!",0
This has problems connecting to my keyboard and mouse. It's like it won't let them recognize each other.,0
Like the multi pockets just didn't like the fit size to baggie,0

Actuator is loud when its running.,0
It was good while it lasted which wasn‚Äôt that long. Whenever I would open it - some of the water would splash. Which was very annoying.,0
wrong size didn't help,0
Very cute but the earpiece has broken already. Not very sturdy.,0
"Update: these have continued to have a considerable amount of pilling on the thighs and pockets where I put my pens. They are comfortable but the fabric is very poor quality. I have only washed and worn them once and the pants are already pilling between the legs. One of the pockets on the legs was also ripped when I received them. They are comfortable and have a decent amount of stretch to the fabric. The pants seem to fit more true to size than the top, the top seems a little big, but I do feel like they did shrink up a little after I washed and dried them.",0
The wig is very thin and sheds a bunch. I will be sending it back ASAP.,0
Definitely not waterproof! The bulb filled up with water when it rained. Now it doesnt work. It looks pretty and if you plan on keeping it somewhere dry it's worth the purchase. However I needed something that was weather resistant and it didnt last a week.,0

"I have been using this machine for over an year and have issues with varying speed. I usually put my walking speed at 3 and can clearly see the speed varying a lot. I dont use any complicated menus, just set the speed and walk but wonder why it goes faster and slower at times. Clearly a defective product. I didnt realize this until the return period has expired.",0
Really thin and cheap material. Not worth the money.,0
"Sent this back. Super annoying to put together. But the last straw is that you can't user the drawers as storage. The bottom is not load bearing. Appropriate only for hanging files. For this price, that doesn't work for me",0
"It does not tick, but I dropped it off my nightstand and the hands fell off. I took off the face plate to reposition--as the instructions say--but the alarm hand could never be set again.

"UPDATE: After trying different pillows from the same company, it is my opinion that I would stay with this option over any of their other pillows. The other pillows were supposed to adjust to the size as they came vacuumed sealed but instead inflated a little bit. After using it for several weeks the pillow is quite flat and does not provide the comfort level hoped for. I‚Äôll just stick with my bunched one until I find a brand that provides the accurate firmness I desire. Thank you. UPDATE: Customer relations has been in touch and offered a different pillow. I‚Äôll let you know how it is. ORIGINAL: These are great but tend to bunch up. For the price they are better than the cheap ones you can get at retail stores but not spectacular if you are looking for a soft pillow. It is soft but like I said does bunch up and constantly have to readjust size to make it more soft as it seems to flatten out at night.",0
I love lashes but these ones were a bit too big and too plastic like feel. Not buying again,0
The Slippers are cute the size just runs a bit small.,0
"Considering the reviews, one would think that this is a good quality pop filter. Don't get me wrong, the pop filter does its job, but the quality is very cheap. The thing will spin and dangle.",0
I had it for a few months and it broke in two places. I have moved on to a different phone but just wanted to leave a warning about this case. The only good thing has going for it is that the back has a good grip and the blue color is nice.,0
Runs small and thin material.,0
Good price and decent sound. Not reliable when it comes to pairing. Often times they disconnect and only one or neither works. My only other complaint is that the rubber seals fall off and stick in your ears.,0
These were way too small. I had to return them.,0
The only place this top fit me was at the bottom around the hips. The top was way too baggy and the neckline hung down on my chest.,0
"Like the title says, this thing is loud as hell, even louder than my fan i have behind me while under load. Other than that works perfectly fine, so long as you can deal with the noise.",0

"I was very excited to try these only to be let down. They did not stay warm for very long. I will say the little time it is warm it does feel nice and that is why I gave it 2 stars. They are supposed to smell like lavender but they don't. They smell good, but I was really looking forward to the relaxing scent of lavender. Overall just a total waste of money. Not worth the price. Will not purchase again.",0
We LOVE Crazy Aaron‚Äôs but this is SOOO LITTLE for $38. Like comically small.,0
This is not what it said it was,0
But maybe that's just me. I had hoped for a grand summation of the trilogy. I read somewhat silly dialogues especially when the Russians were involved. Very juvenile sounding.

I was pretty disappointed in this shirt! Looking at reviews people said how soft it was but when I got it I felt the exact opposite! The shirt is not only super rough (honestly feels like sand paper) BUT it is see through when i hold it in the air. It isn‚Äôt soft and the quality is not good which disappointed me as we were supposed to wear to Halloween party,0
I ordered white and received an ugly gold,0
I‚Äôve had this on my phone for maybe a month and the hinge had already loss its integrity. The colour started running off pretty quick too.,0
This headset make my ears sooooo hot. I searched online for replacement ear pads but I couldn't find anything. The power button also broke. I can still power it on and off but its a pain to do so. I definitely would not recommend these to anyone to buy.,0
Worked for 1.5 years and burned out... Would've expected a few more years out of a simple resistor.,0
too big to look nice,0

Now I have nowhere to plug my internet phone in. I actually needed two ports. Ridiculous.",0
"Not good. The tip on one of them didn't work. Also, the ink of the rest of them ran out extremely quick. Not satisfied, won't buy again.",0
None of the seats grew,0
"Not sure why this gets such high reviews. You really get what you pay for. This is a $22 cage. The wire panels poorly connect with each other, we had to fold them and tighten them down so the panels would stay together. I've owned a C &C cage before and I would just pay the extra $30 to $40 and get one of those. That is probably what I'll end up doing. Very disappointed.",0
"This is not a heavy cream, it's more just a cream. Doesn't do much for my feet, one of the worst products I purchased for feet & I wear socks when I put this on to see if it works better, no.

There was no edge or rim protection. I was looking for something similar to my old IPad cover,0
My only disappointment is in the color. The Color online makes the pink seem vivid pink which is what I was looking for in the wristband. In reality the color appears more rose gold so don‚Äôt feel the product was true to color.,0
Had better results with older pair. Cat has gone on a killing spree lately.,0
I used this product for two weeks and it started bugging out.. after spending 60$ I was not impressed with how fast it broke,0
"I don‚Äôt like this screen protector. Although it does add grip to the screen, it also makes the screen loom fuzzier/pixelated when you look up close.

"Doesn't fit snugly when you attach it to the watch. You can see it is not flush like the real Apple band that came with the product. I guess what else can you expect from a knockoff. But yeah, if you're anal about that kind of stuff, don't get it. It bugs me. Sometimes looks like it is going to fall out completely.",0
"I received the product on time but it was a reconditioned one. I ordered a new one. The cord was just wrapped around the unit, it was missing the back to the remote and the corner was chipped.",0
Bought the battery in May 2018 and it worked fine for a few months. I use it to run the stereo system in my golf cart. As of a few months ago the battery lasts about 10 minutes and dies. I would suggest spending more money on a better product with a real warranty.,0

"The price was reasonable except that these sculpting tools were not ready to be used without sanding. They were barley in the shapes showed on Amazon. They are NOT ready to be used for smoothing or even medium fine details. These tools would cause more harm in sculpting than they would aid in artistic creating. I've seen better quality in the simplest children's/beginner tools sets. I may take sandpaper to them some day, but right now they will live in the back of a drawer somewhere in my studio.",0
"I thought this would help me, keep my phone in my pocket and I can use my phone but not so fast, they advertise like it is an Apple Watch but not even close. Just get an Apple Watch if you use your phone like me all the time",0
Smells astringent. One bottle arrive cracked and leaking.,0
Does hold as many wipes as I would like.,0
"I was so excited about this popcorn, but it turned out to be a disappointment. You are better off buying truffle oil on your own and just adding it to the sunflower oil in the sea salt variety, that 's what I normally do. There just isn't much flavor to it and though I absolutely know less is more with truffle oil, they took that a bit too far with this one.",0

Cute style but...Sizing was completely off. Had to return. They were huge & baggy.,0
For me it was a very disconnected story. Didn‚Äôt pull me In. And not a lot of takeaways that will linger in my mind long after that last page. Not a fan.,0
Well so far it works but I had to unplug it and plug it back in to get it to start back working since I've done that it seems to be fine but it charge slow,0
Very artificial tasting,0
Way bigger than expected,0

I really wanted to love this carrier.... I do love all the pockets and it is very soft. I didn‚Äôt like that the front waist band would fold while wearing it. I didn‚Äôt like that the belt would get all twisted up every time I went to put the carrier on. Also the waist would also become looser and I felt I had to keep adjusting. Also we have only used this carrier a handful of time and there is already stitching that as come undone in 2 places... We love our Lillebaby luxe. Unfortunately I think I‚Äôll be trying to return this carrier.,0
The lens was a bit bent and I‚Äôm able to see glare behind me all the time.,0
"I bought these for my husband, a true orange biscuit lover of another brand, and he didn't get through one box - much less all 6.",0
"It was nice for the first time we used it when camping. The next time we used it, the lid leak a lot.",0
"Old stories, retold.",0
the product is fine. it's the shipping delays on what's supposed to be 2-day shipping that has me upset.,0
These pads are too small. Sometimes a pad will get bunched up while I‚Äôm using it and get stuck in my dog‚Äôs mouth.,0
Expected a box of chips for a large dog. Instead a medium size bag with chips cut into strips. For the price very disappointing. You can do better.,0
"The lid has broken after having it for exactly two weeks. Water leaks everywhere now. They do not offer a replacement lid, only full refunds after all bottles are returned ( I‚Äôd have to pay for all the packaging supplies so the glass doesn‚Äôt break) not worth the hassle or cost. I was pleased until this happened.",0
The strap that goes between you toes is hard and rough and it created blisters between my toes. The sole of the sandal is comfortable.,0
"Got the package on time. But the seeds look nothing like American Paw Paws, so I think I got shafted for a few bucks. Won't be doing this again. Better to buy Paw Paws in the USA.",0
Lasted less than 3 weeks with my pit mix. Would have been less but he barely played with it. I‚Äôve had other toys from this mfg that my dog loved and lasted but this is not one of them.,0
they tare at the bands easy.,0
Its a good idea. The lid is a little difficult to remove. And can make a mess if you fill it up with spit. You'd be better off using an old soup can with a paper towel. It'd be easier to clean and its dishwasher safe too.,0
"I didn't like that this screen shipped in a small box all folded up and not rolled in a long tube, because when I took it out it had squared creases throughout the entire screen that did not go away after a week of having it on my wall.",0
We like the dimmer and usb plug option. The snooze button is not good. If I had the box i would return it.,0
I didn‚Äôt like the fact that there wasn‚Äôt enough detail about the marriages.,0
"Smell is nice, but did nothing for my pesky plantar warts on the bottom of my feet. However, people respond to essential oils differently, so it could work for someone else.",0
I had this tea in a cafe and thought is was so good do I decided too buy it on line and try it. I opened the package and brewed a cup and to my surprise it was so potent with almond and it smelled like parfume.,0
I did not receive the cat eye magnet either. Pictures are deceiving. Did not receive any kind of base or top coat and the colors are not labeled in any way.,0
Decent compression sock but the sizing is not quite as advertised. Try ordering a size down.,0
Didn't hold phone at all,0
"The picture on the box shows a cake full of custard filling. Make no mistake, that isn't what you get. You get a soft cake with a squirt of filling. Pretty disappointing actually. I will not be purchasing this again.",0
I am disappointed that the delivery is so SLOW! I ordered these on MAY 1st and the expected delivery date is LATE JUNE or possibly not until JULY! I DO NOT Recommend this company and would Not order from them again!!!,0
"I buy Blu-ray‚Äôs because of the language options. First movie has basically every language except Spanish? Not able to watch the movies with the folks now...quality was good, movie is funny, but the Blu-ray product was a let down.....",0
"I ordered 2 packs knowing that there should be 24 treats/lollipops in each package. I did received the 2 package, but to my big disappointment, there were just 12 lollipops in each pack. Where were the other halves of my order? Sorry, but I‚Äôm returning them.",0
A lot of them didn't work in my machine And the ones that did work had a bad after taste,0
"Shipping took WAY to long even after I selected prime shipping, the case doesn‚Äôt look Like the picture it resembles it but it‚Äôs pretty cheap looking in person. 2 stars because it does have a nice bumper that‚Äôll protect the screen if dropped",0
Beware. This scope does NOT fit Bug A Salt guns. No instructions provided and the box is closed with a rubber band. Tired of misleading advertising.,0
I have IC and this didn't work for me. I tried it with alcohol and coffee.,0
Return after did not work,0
"Did not last over a year. My dog was able to take all the coating off exposing bare metal and having this crate rust. He was also able to bend and remove multiple bars over time and now has rendered this crate useless. If your dog has anxiety or likes to escape, get a better crate! Now I'll go spend $700 on a proper one as I should have in the first place.",0
Never got to try the band on the watch because when I opened the package I could tell the color of the RED band was very dull. Not the vibrant red shown in the picture.,0
"I didn't notice any significant glare reduction for night driving. On top of that, once the visor is attached, it sits a bit too high (even with my seat raised up as much as possible). I am not short, so this was disappointing.",0
Got a completely different item.,0
"The shoes are super comfortable, but the bottom of the shoe came off since the beginning and I tried to put some glue but still came off later. Really disapointed",0
"Design is nice, but it broke already the day after I put it up.",0
"The original website has cost of $99, why are some pieces more expensive here!?",0
Too complicated to set up and use! Request return instructions. Thanks.,0
"Very disappointing audio quality! Sound is slightly muffled, lacking highs, and slightly distorted. Also, the bluetooth pairing is unreliable as it shifts from one device to another by itself if both signals are present. I would not buy again!",0
Doesn‚Äôt stay stuck to shower wall,0
"Its a bit larger than I was expecting. My cat cannot figure it out and is starving himself instead of taking the time to dig into every crevice of the maze to get his food! And this cat of mine is obsessed with eating, so the fact that he wont take the time to figure out how to eat out of this is quite shocking. Is my cat just that dumb? Or Lazy? Or spoiled?",0
"So this product is pretty useless when it arrives and the pin isn‚Äôt sharp at all. It‚Äôs a flat end, when shown as a sharpened end.",0
"I like the fact that it's glass but do not like the fact that this doesn't adhere to the glass surface. There is a gap (air space) between the glass and the phone screen glass. Not ideal. Yes I can turn up the sensitivity but i often find my typing way off. Very annoying. Would NOT buy this again. Then again, I'm no fan of the edge design either, it sucks too.",0
The 9v batteries don‚Äôt even fit correctly...... the slightest of movement will make the lights very dim or completely turn off...... fix your battery pack and you have yourself something really nice but until then i do not recommend,0
"This product is much smaller than anticipated. It ships directly from China, so it take quite some time to get here.",0
They are very cute. The ones that didn‚Äôt leak write well. I stopped using them.,0
"We loved the look and for a couple of days it worked, but was it.",0
Definitely spend a little more money and get better quality. These are not smooth and require a lot of sanding to even get them semi smooth. I‚Äôve been painting peg dolls for a few years and these have been worse than 2nds that I have ordered from craft sites. The photo I also put on here is after much sanding and still very rough.,0
"Some swear by it, but it's not near as good as what I've had in the past. It either needs to be tapered below the knee, or longer so it doesn't bunch behind the knee. I would prefer the entire thing to be longer. It's smaller than I expected.",0
Doesnt fit on the noodle well. Made too big.,0
Bought Two Tried to return both but sight would only except one return I guess I'll just eat one Not happy,0
I bought this as a gift. It came in a clear plastic bag. The case itself is a soft case and doesn't seem to be very durable. I also ordered the Smatree case. It came in a nice box and is a better quality case. I would recommend the Smatree,0
"They broke after my 3rd use. I don't play hard, at least I don't think so. Even so, my kit is mic'ed. I have no need to play hard.",0
Very poor quality of material. I am 165lb and 5.5 tall so I ordered a larg. The dress is too tight in the breast area. So I am not happy,0
"It keeps falling apart on locking mechanism, you need keep an eye on the seperate parts otherwise you will lose them dont recommend for camping",0
"bought 3 sets (6 individual) and after a few days the first one didn‚Äôt go on anymore, 10 days later the second one failed and about 3 weeks later the 3rd one failed. looks good but I‚Äôm Very disappointed. Too expensive to buy again",0
"Good on symptoms and diagnostics, treatment not so much",0
Been using twice a week since July (2 mths) and nothing. By all means my face got worse.,0
Had to return due to the awful smell on these pants,0
"This product has problems; when you try to assemble it you quickly realize some of the drill holes (especially on the top shelf) are too close together by approximately 1/8 inch. The only way you can assemble this product is to forcibly bend the heavy duty wire retaining pieces until they slide into the drill holes. Even then, ""slide"" is not the correct word because you have to beat them into place with a rubber mallet: Assuming you are strong enough to do this, once beaten into place the bent- wire retainer pieces will try to spring open; this runs the permanent risk of splitting the wooden shelf into two or more pieces. If that happens this under sink shelf unit will not be a pretty sight!",0
It does look cool but the reception is horrible! Can't even get my local radio stations in that are right around the corner in the same town :(,0
"While the syringes work fine, there is an awful lot of play in the connection with the syringe tip. There is play in the tip connection itself and also there is play in the locking collar to the body of the syringe. While it doesn't leak or lose the syringe tip it is somewhat disconcerting that when you use it it feels like it's coming apart.",0
The chokers themselves were pretty and really shined. But my neck turned green. First time that's ever happened to me. You could even see where the necklace moved around during the day. All green.,0
Quality is not any different than frames from the dollar store.,0
Received today. 2 bulbs come in one package. One of the two is defective. I searched my order and Amazon to find a way to contact the seller to let them know that one of the 2 bulbs was defective but my only options are to give a review and leave feedback for the seller. I would prefer a replacement. $9.99 for one bulb that works. Buyer beware!,0
Want latest news. They just clips. Need whole news. Was searching for 10 o‚Äôclock new of Dallas. Tx all recorded.,0
"The book in itself is of course amazing, who doesnt love Agatha Christie. But this version is lacking, it doesnt have any of the images (maps and layouts crucial to the plot). I had to look these up online. I guess thats the cost of reading a free book.",0
"Most of these are fine, but the tubes are too long for the bottles. AND the roller balls don‚Äôt work.",0
The last time I ordered them I fell in love with them. I loved the color of the black! I ordered them again and these ones are in the same bag but the color is different and matched my pearlized blacks that I had and not the pretty black from the last package I had purchased from this site,0
Unreliable setting mechanism. Goes off too easily.,0
Its too small Hence too tiring and impractical..The hexagon size should be very big.,0
"This pencil worked great for about 2 weeks then it went into a slow incline of the work once in a while mode. Now, it's hit and miss if it works. Very disappointed but then again, that's what happens when you try to save money and not get the real deal.",0
"I've purchased these magnets on two different occasions. The first time they are colorful and terrific! This time however, the magnets keep coming unglued from the clips. The clips are great for chips, or holding a bunch of papers on to the refrigerator. I guess I'll get out my super glue. Update: All but one of the magnets won't stick to the clip. So frustrating.",0
"Came used. Litteraly had a piece of food packaged with the knife. Emailed the seller and they said it was not in their hands, blaming it on the dealer and not doing much to make up for the situation or make their customer satisfied. 2 out of five, buy from some other guys. Quality wise, the plastic split when trying to shove the knife in to the black card. Everything came with scratches, fingerprints, smudges, indicating its ‚Äúused‚Äù-ness when I bought it new.",0
One of the clips was delivered already broken off from a lid. Seems flimsy already!,0
"I‚Äôve had these earphones for a little over a month. I was able to pair easily when they first arrived. The earphones would connect to my device without a problem. This last time I charged them however it will not pair to my phone. I‚Äôve followed the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. Turned off the Bluetooth, restarted the phone and the earphones still don‚Äôt connect.",0
"My family was excited about Olaf's Frozen adventure, but disappointed. Not as entertaining and quite short. The additional ""Disney Tales"" are available in many other locations and totally not what children these days are used to seeing for quality.",0
"I like this bag has a long shoulder strap to carry - which many do not. It has a thin felt lining and a small pocket on the outside, a bit tight to fit gloves, but cannot fit anything else in there. Overall too small, want to put some other additional things in bag and cannot - also the shoulder strap is quite flimsy cheap. There is no real 'padding' in this bag. Looking for a truly padded larger bag for helmet - this is not it.",0
I thought this book was totally unrealistic. Sorry I bought it. Will avoid this author in the future. Oh well.,0
"The popcorn was fine, but the packaging was horrible. They put 6 bottles in a box with hardly no packaging material. Maybe two strips of the air bubble packaging. that's almost 50 lbs in one box! the plastic containers moved around too much in transit and several of them broke open. we had popcorn kernals all over our receiving department and lost 1.5 containers of kernels.",0
These are a poor fit for me as they always feel like they will fall off,0
My dell wouldn't recognize the cable on my new laptop. Cable is made well though and will likely work if not using it for charging.,0
To hard to put together!,0
I returned this product because I didn't like how it looked on. The dress was a little big for what I thought a large would be. I would've kept if it was just a little bit smaller.,0
Didn‚Äôt work. Dog still itches.,0
"So I wasn‚Äôt looking for anything amazing when I bought this fan. Just a small tower fan that had basic settings. What I got was a high powered random wind generating machine. Normally you‚Äôd think setting the fan on low med or high would produce a constant breeze and sound, but this fan surges at random intervals. It‚Äôs incredibly annoying and makes it harder to sleep than no fan at all. I wish I had taken it out of the box right away vs saving it for a hot day. Uggg don‚Äôt buy.",0
"I really liked this water bottle for the first month or so. I was able to get over the fact that you cannot close the straw and leave the bottle in the car or it will drench you. It's been five months and the straw has completely stopped working and if I want to use the bottle I have to unscrew the top and drink from the bottle itself. After about a month, I noticed it slowly starting to break but was able to use anyways but now I must buy another and it will NOT be this one again!",0
"Could not hook up to my Coax cable on my dish system. This item attaches with a push on cable end, mine is a screw on cable end. returned",0
Box came unwrapped. Only 4 pads total. 2 small and 2 large. Pretty disappointed how this product arrived.,0
"Hand washing, handle snapped on me in two spots.",0
This product came quickly and set up easily but somehow the main door is slightly bent where the second latch is. Needed the pen so not returning it just a little disappointed in the quality. Especially because it was in the box and sealed when I got it.,0
"Let me start by saying that I really liked the look of these, however as others have stated, these are much narrower than the standard croc. I don't have especially wide feet, but I could not wear these. I could tell blisters were starting to form just from wearing these around the house for a little while. Others heated them up and re-molded them, but I wasn't about to try that so I had to return them.",0
"I have a Huawei Mate 10 Pro, I ordered and received the Mate 10 Pro Supershieldz. At the bottom there is a cutout for the Huawei brand name, it's to small. At the top the left hole in the shield doesn't line up w the indicator on the phone. Will not order from Supershieldz again",0
Bought this for SI joint pain in pregnancy. It was a great belt for about a week. Wearing it everyday it started to stretch. The picture shows how it stretched out (from less than two months of wearing it everyday). It works stretched out but it‚Äôs not comfortable under my clothes because the Velcro parts are now bigger than the stretched out parts.,0
I cannot give a review as of yet because its a christmas gift. But the shipping was super quick,0
On the picture the at amazon market place the leather look shiny and more vibrant but see it when it came after waiting month and the half to see my leather car seats cover. I was disappointed at the material because the leather look like a PU leathers not genuine as it said.i will appreciate a little compensation.,0
nice inserts but didn't help me,0
only works on games it just junk to me,0
The Kleenex were shipped with dog food and treats with no packing so the 3 Kleenex boxes were smashed. It looked like the way Walmart ships things which is why I use Amazon.,0
Very disappointing as they aren't near as substantial as they appear in the picture. I will return them.,0
"Bought on December 20, 2017 and as of today, August 20, 2019 one lamp is burnt out. Seems they should last longer.",0
"The picture shows the 3rd edition, which is what I was looking for as a gift. I was sent the 5th edition. I look to return the item, and it shows I can‚Äôt. Great.",0
It squeaks.... loud and a lot! From the first time I used it! I‚Äôm new to dermarolling and I figured this would be a good one to start with after seeing many blogs and reviews talking about how great it is. Ive used it 3 times and now it‚Äôs trashed because I‚Äôve found better quality roller elsewhere.,0
This did not come with the support bar that connects the legs so it is not wobbly - the picture shows it with the support bars - I couldn't return it because my son was coming home from foot surgery and needed it that day. It is very wobbly for a 6 foot 180 lb man,0
"I tested the site. I installed parallel to my driveway per the instructions created a complete enclosure to keep it water tight. It works part of the time, when the vehicle is leaving. The alarm is loud enough to be heard at least faintly even in the basement. It is not reliable. It transmits, it's placed properly it just isn't reliable. It's past the return date so I'll shop for a more liable one and resell this one.",0
It had great drying power until it stopped working 9 months later. I would not buy from this company again. As other reviews stated the plug falls out of the outlet,0
"The sound quality is not the greatest. My Bose are much better, but for the price, they will work.",0
very expensive for towels that were never great and deteriorated over time,0
Well 3 of the five stop working with no reason,0
I guess some dogs just don't care,0
"My 5 year old granddaughter wears a size 10 shoe and these are too large on her feet. They are so stiff and uncomfortable that she won't even try to wear them. She does like how they light up, but since she won't put them on her feet, that feature is useless.",0
I paid for 40 feet of chain and received 33 feet.,0
"In the product description they call this thing a mat - by definition, a mat is a piece of fabric material. This is nothing but an overpriced piece of plastic that arrives rolled up and never lays flat. Don't waste your time with this product.",0
"I bought this 3 months ago for my 7 year old diabetic son. It‚Äôs a perfect size for a kid and also fits me. He‚Äôs found it comfortable and hasn‚Äôt complained. He wears it everyday to school and all weekend. There‚Äôs an intentional hole in the back for pump tubing, which is great. However, the fabric has started tearing where the hole is located. My son doesn‚Äôt have a pump, so we haven‚Äôt even been putting tubing through the hole. I now need to purchase him a new fanny pack since this one is tearing, and I will not be purchasing this brand again. It‚Äôs just too cheaply made.",0
"Came quick, was packaged inside one of those silver plastic bags inside a cardboard box. No other packing. Installed it into a nvr I purchased and it didn't turn on. Replacement is to be shipped to me and I'll edit this posting after installation of that hd.",0
I bought 2 of these sets we love them but unfortunately 2 of the lights are not able to turn on because they are defective,0
There is almost no padding between the speakers and your ear. It also doesnt completely enclose my eyes and a little light gets through the bottom. Has fallen off in my sleep every night I've tried to wear it.,0
Parts were too little,0
The case is flimsy and feels cheap.,0
"This product would be great except that the product was in a damaged condition before it was shipped. It appeared to be shipped that way. We received the boxes in good condition holding the items and opened the boxes on one end assuming all was well but in actuality, the racks were scratched and dented. The boxes holding the items were not damaged at all. We did not fully take out the product of its box in order to keep them clean until their application. At the time we needed to use the racks, and upon further inspection, the items were scratched and one of the corners was dented. By this time, the ""return window"" had expired.",0
"The lid does not stay open, have to hold it open to remove drone and controller, makes it annoying",0
Not what I expected. Picture is very deceiving.,0
Does not cook the stuff uniformly and tends to burn the bread.,0
It‚Äôs ok and not that great,0
It fit my screen just fine. It does have a popping sound on the edges and you have to press hard to text/type on the edges.,0
"Most of the research information I was already aware of but it was well presented. However, I found the diet suggestions to be unreasonable not in purpose but in cost. Fish although worth eating and organics important in addition the suggested supplements, I found the cost prohibitive to most family units. There are good, reliable sources on the internet for information on keto and meal suggestions you just have to do your research.",0
"Super pretty and I wanted this to work so badly for me. But... I apparently have a long torso, coupled with a bit of a belly, so even the largest size gave me a crotch wedgie. If I adjusted the straps to lower it though, my boobs were just completely hanging out... Bummer. If they had a longer version, I'd get it in every color. But unfortunately it had to be returned.",0
I thought they‚Äôd be much softer. They‚Äôre not terrible but not worth the $$,0
I used this machine 3 full times with normal use and it burned out. I had to return it twice. I finally gave up and got a refund.,0
Every time I plug my controllers in it's a hassle just to get them to charge,0
I didn‚Äôt dare to open this item since it came already open with tape. It looks like it was a previous return. I am returning this item. I never open it.,0
"Previous batch received in September 2019 of the same flavor (toasted onion & garlic) was very delicious. This batch received in October does not taste good and I keep getting acid when I try it. The date on it is for November 2020, the bag looked fine (sealed, no issues) and I've tried it a few times on different days. It's definitely the pumpkin seeds, not me. This brand is the first I've found with whole roasted pumpkin seeds that are not made mostly of salt, and I've been pleased to discover them. Not so pleased if this is a sample of their quality control.",0
"The cup look and feels is sexy and slick. Only problem is the bad sipping design. If you're storing really hot tea/coffee, sipping through it can cause your lips to burn easily. I ended up having to open the lid each time I have need a drink.",0
The brush head doesn‚Äôt stay on! It falls off so easily so you have to be super careful which takes away the convenience of doing it in the shower.,0
Just not necessary. I know. I know. Everybody's doing it. I resold mine after temporarily losing my mind and buying into the hype. I realized my pots & pans work just fine. I'm not so important I need to free up even more of my time. I can accomplish many things while browning then slow-cooking a roast. And it tastes better from the oven anyhow.,0
"Be very careful when ordering this. It will give you the option to order black, but I was still sent the blue.",0
"Mat was folded in half in the box, upon unpacking it is now curved and I am unsure if it will return to a completely flat state, will update review if it does or they each out to me",0
"Very bright screen and poor audio, neither can be changed.",0
Wheels are great..... this time customer service was poor reason for 2 stars.,0
I‚Äôve purchased these for 2 years. Prices keep increasing but the quality gets worse. 12 inch pieces are now spliced together and come apart within minutes.,0
Did not work well with me. Has surprisingly made my hair more greasy. I usually wash my hair every two to three days but with this shampoo I‚Äôve had to wash it every other day. Should be noted that I have a dry scalp and oily roots. **Reviewed after 2 weeks of use,0
"Only had it a year and a half, slightly used and already broken",0
"In addition to not helping me curb my appetite and not keeping me in ketosis, I can't stand the texture of this! It doesn't mix well at all. I already have a favorite keto base, but I was looking to try something different. I spent a few hours researching different types of keto bases and reading reviews before making my purchase. This product seemed to have great reviews, however I was incredibly disappointed with the results. I have been using this 2-3 times per day and somehow my ketone levels have dropped. With my other keto base I was able to drink it in the morning and fast until the afternoon. When I drink this in the morning, I'm hungry by 10am.",0
when i received the item already broken and open,0
"Charges OK, but didn't recognize my external HDs, not what I needed, returned.",0
"In the Q&A section it states ""glass"" but it is plastic. Works fine, but I do not like getting misled, so I returned it.",0
"I ordered the thong style slippers. I have a large space between my big toe and other toes, and always wear thongs and flip flop styles with no problem: however these slippers hurt my toes so badly that I am unable to wear them. The part that is supposed to go between my toes is set too far toward the inside of the shoe, thus making the toe bar pull toward my second toe so much that it hurts when I walk. They would be nice and comfy without that problem, but that is a HUGE problem. Wasted money, because I removed the tag before trying on and would cost too much to return. Sad!",0
Nice backpack but the zipper broke and it is completely unusable and the return window was closed already.,0
I bought this item to cushion my lip and move my lip/cheek away from the chewing surface of my teeth. Halfway through the box I found the quality dropped off and the poorly produced rolls were too thin and did no cushioning. This resulted in no small amount of pain.,0
My vizio sound bar sounds much better. This has No bass to it or sound improvements. Just sounded like my tv was up super loud.,0
We purchased this as a gift and after a few uses the plastic lid cracked. We contacted the company but were sent the wrong lid twice and now they are not responding to my emails. Poor customers service.,0
"Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this is a case where you get what you pay for. Blades dulled too quickly.",0
Waste of money. Once you wet them they get sticky all Over your hands. And I had to scrub. Might as well use a washcloth,0
Kind of a let down...only had one category of 24 puzzles and that was it...boring,0
This is entirely useless. It fits too low so that your head doesn't reach it and you're right back where you started.,0
"I did truly enjoy this game, I was having fun and then the puzzles got too challenging and I kept losing. I want a game that is fun with some challenge; not a game that is so challenging that I keep losing - too much of that in real life!",0
This is what it looked like when I opened it... Yuck.,0
"Although in theory these are a great idea, I had 2 major issues with them. First, the seams of some of these came apart in the first wash. Second, and more importantly, I have a reaction to the rubber on the inside of the socks. They make my skin break out in an itchy rash. Sensitive skin beware.",0
"It isn't gross, but it also isn't very good either. This is the lemonade and compared to the Crystal Light Pure Lemonade it is downright strange and not as good. It isn't tart like lemonade should be, it's just very bitter.",0
Not even close as ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù,0
The picture looks bigger then what it is actually is very thin,0
"I installed the screen as directed, but the lower half only connects back to itself occasionally. There is plenty of slack in the screen, in fact there are waves in the screen when it is connected. My last one was taught when the magnets grabbed, and they landed every time.",0
The colours in real life are very different than what is pictured. I know with computers imaging can be wrong but this was very off. Unfortunate because I was very excited when I ordered it.,0
"Cheaply made. The bottoms fit way better than the top. If your big busted, go for a more expensive quality made swimsuit with ample support. If you are a A, B, maybe a C Cup woman you can pull this look off easy.",0
"This wasn't terrible, but it was terribly slow. Reading the other reviews, I'm guessing it's a more enjoyable watch for runners. I was hoping this would be motivational, but I just got bored watching it. Great job for all the accomplishments for the people who were involved in the documentary. They were great--the documentary itself, not so much.",0
"If you want less stopping power, then buy these. At first, these pads seemed the closest thing to an original pad, but with less dust. Then I drove when it was cold and wet and I lost all brakes. I have tried 4 different brake pads on the XC90 and these Bosch pads are good when warm and dry, but the worst of them all when cold and wet. Imagine you need to make an emergency stop when it is raining or snowing, good luck. I had to remember to keep on tapping on the brakes before stopping to be safe. If you live in Arizona, this would probably work. If you live where you get wet or snow seasons, I would not recommend these pads.",0
I do not know how to use this thing,0
Red was more of an orange. Inside is cheap. Zipper is good though.,0
"I purchased this controller last year. The buttons on the back align with your pinky and ring finger. This took some getting use to but was able to adjust after a month or two. So you will have an advantage over other controller players, until the controller breaks... Just one year in, the analog sticks are chafing. The residue falls into the controller causing a delay in reaction time. You'll have to blow it out to resolve this issue. My left analog stick also cracked and is constantly falling off (note: I do not throw my controller EVER and do not press hard on the sticks) On top of these issues, the controller wigs out sometimes, turns a deep pink color and the extra buttons don't work at all. There is no fix, you just have to wait for them to start working again. The bottom left button on the back of the controller now only works half the time which is really annoying. Overall, fun while it lasts but for almost $200 I was really hoping for better quality.",0
"This is a very nice book for the content, and I would recommend it as a resource for education. My complaint is that I purchased the book based on the ‚Äúlike new‚Äù description. Clearly, as you can see from the photos, this Book was NOWHERE near ‚Äúlike new‚Äù condition and unfortunately I bought based on this description. It was also packaged as ‚Äúinspected‚Äù however the cover was clearly ripped from the binding. Anyway, just a warning for those purchasing from used listings, that the description of used may not be accurate/deceptive.",0
"It works fine, but over time the connection became increasingly sketchy with the power cord.",0
"Purchased because we trust the maker, but this particular product did not live up to that standard. Weird texture and poor fit. Use at your own risk.",0
This powder was not for me. I did not like the protein after taste. I will not order this brand of protein powder due to the taste.,0
A stone feel off the second day of use.,0
cheap made and doesn't work well at all,0
"cheaply made but it works would not buy again, no good in low light",0
"Fantastic small tuner with adjustable frequency option. Only a two star rating because it displays a flashing ""A"" In the sharp position for the b-string, that problem began two weeks after the delivery.",0
Item arrived later than expected and missing two bolts. This was only discovered after reaching last step of assembly. Trying to figure out a solution because I don't want to take this thing apart and ship it back. Otherwise it seems like a good grill.,0
Doesn‚Äôt look like the photo. Neck is much smaller and doesn‚Äôt hang off the shoulder.,0
"I would have given this 5 stars but the photos are misleading. It shows a little hand held drill, but that was missing from my set. I bought this specific set because I thought it came with the tiny drill. Everything else was there and works well.",0
"The case was cute. But after almost 2weeks, the rhinestones were falling off and that made the case get caught on things and pull.",0
Was not pleased with this shirt at all. The material was SUPER thin and extremely small. I ordered a 2XL thinking it would fit being i sized up. It was more like a size large fit. Super bummed about this purchase.,0
Leaves ugly white film that‚Äôs hard to even out,0
Never got it. They kept pushing back the delivery date. After a month my order was cancelled.,0
"Beautiful color, looks exactly like picture. They stuck together during transportation. (We blew up 12 hrs in advance) Used electric balloon pump and once the pump got a little warm, the hot air popped balloons. Lost about 20 balloons total. Will not buy again. Advise you buy more than needed.",0
The sole inside the shoe does not stay in place which makes it difficult and bothersome to put the shoe on and off.,0
The individual packets inside damaged box appear intact but feel I now have to inspect each packet for tampering prior to using.,0
"Bought this for a friend that likes League of Legends, and while they might appreciate the gift for how it looks, this plush is made terribly. The fur is matted, and clumps of the fur are falling out. It sheds everywhere, and there is something that feels like metal wiring inside of it that makes it very unpleasant to the touch.",0
"I'm new to fishing, I saw these bobbers on a video about trout fishing. I thought I'd give them a try. I couldn't figure out how to put them on my line and they came with no instructions.i really thought they would be sliced up the side or something. I must have to take my line apart to thread it on. It's probably relatively simple but now I'm going to have to whatch another video to find out.",0
The straps are far too long and can only be adjust a bit.,0
"We are missing 3 red darts. Now I get to spend more money buying replacement darts! Thanks for ripping us off. Kids were happy till they saw missing dart, hope Karma finds you.",0
More like a sports bra,0
Your guy do good job,0
"I'm a little disappointed. Very cute, however, not sure if there is something wrong with the pump, but it's not working like a normal pump would. Its very hard to push the soap out and although i filled the jar up with soap, it'll squirt the soap out like it was empty. 2 stars for the look. Other than that it was a waste of $10. Also i thought i was getting 2 for that price, but only 1.",0
Does not work good. Not sharp and doesn‚Äôt pull out any hairs. Very dull and not worth the money.,0
Works fine if within 6 feet of the router. Both switches had the same limited range problem.,0
"I was excited to get these, but surprised to find them so small. They were so lightweight I could not get them to throw very far. Quality-wise they seem to be just fine. I just wish there were a little bigger. Probably my fault for not reading the specs better.",0
This heater worked great for a few months. I was very pleased with it at first. But within 6 months it stopped working. Will not be wasting my money on this thing again.,0
These Look Great and Seem Awesome . but they Don't Hold up too Much better than Any other Cord .. Cheap ones even . I've Already had to Chuck 3 of them ...... Oh well .. I'll Get a Diff brand/Make Next time !,0
Don't waste your money! I get more energy from my morning cup of espresso then these. They are over priced and don't really do anything except make your wallet empty.,0
This book dragged for me. I couldn't get into the characters. The thing bugging me most was the utter lack of believability for some of the actions taken as well as plot points. More research was needed.,0
Not what I expected. I was hoping for more definition.,0
I didn't like this water bowl because the bottom is very shallow and the water goes everywhere when an animal drinks. I have to keep a towel under it.,0
I like the top but the bottom was not sized correctly. I had to return it,0
This was a 6/6s case. Not 7/8 at all. Had a headphone jack. I returned.,0
Some came with half paint not sure if it‚Äôs because of the heat while it was being shipped but the color wasn‚Äôt fully on the beads.,0
It was an ok eyeliner brush. Cute box.,0
The sequins on this dress were so sharp. I wore the dress for less than 30 minutes and had the worst scratches on my thighs. It was so uncomfortable and painful. I couldn‚Äôt stand it. Thank goodness I brought a secondary outfit for our event.,0
I liked the shoe after I finally got the right foot to fit. The left shoe was easy to get on. The right foot was a struggle. It was s very poor fit it seemed like two different sizes,0
"We bought these a few months ago. None of them are working anymore. They are brittle. If the cord bends while you charge with these cords, they will wear very fast.",0
I only received 5 pairs,0
Came with a broken light bulb,0
"If you are looking for a good slight wedge pillow with back supporting incline this is not the pillow for you. I purchased this pillow because I am a back sleeper and I wanted a slight incline and cervical support. I opened package let it completely expand. I then laid down for 15 minutes to see if it would work for me. Short answer is NOPE. It claims to be a very supportive memory foam wedge with support for your neck. They do not say that you need to have a specific length of neck for this pillow to be comfortable. I do not have a long neck, however it isn't that short. This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly. Also the supportive part ends at almost a standard pillow size and then there is a soft floppy pad of light weight and very soft 1"" memory foam. That accounts for half the pillows length. After 5-10 minutes my lower back started to spasm. I will give benefit of the doubt here and add a disclaimer that maybe I happened to get a defective pillow. Maybe it was not up to the company's typical standards. I am returning it with no plans on exchanging it for another of the same pillow.",0
Beautiful earrings! My 7-year-old loves them! But very disappointed to see that 3 of the colored stones have fallen out after she‚Äôs worn them only a very short time.,0
While the nail polish was cute it just didn‚Äôt stay on my daughters nails and wasn‚Äôt very dark in color. It was like paining a clear coat with glitter.,0
"Very thin rug, best used as a couch cover or dog blanket. Wanted to return it but postage to Japan would have been almost as much as i paid for the ""rug"" no more foreign purchases for me",0
"Half the box was crushed, the other half packed poorly.",0
"As a cane, it's just OK. Joints are wabbly. The flash light is useless. I thought the batteries were dead so I bough new batteries and it's just as dim. You have about 3 inches of light visibility.",0
Sent me pink and purple. They are nice bibs but it is not what I ordered.,0
Nozzle clogs and sprays in any direction after one use.,0
"This is my second one the first one last me a couple month‚Äôs and this one last me couple week‚Äôs . My problem is right now my cannot stay hot for 20 minutes. When I was using it my stay for hours , Can you please send me a replacement.thank you",0
Looks and feels like a dollar store Halloween costume,0
"when plugged in, it needed support at the bottom or doesn't make complete contact with outlet. I placed my luggage and a shoe underneath for support.",0
No tracks- means it will be hard to make a straight cut. No blade adjustment -means you cant adjust the deepness of your cut.,0
"Liars. This does not work with any other smart devices without their respective hubs. I had to buy the Hue Hub in order to get the Harmony hub to work with my Hue lights. Works acceptably as a remote. Does do its prime function of setting the 7 devices I have in my entertainment system for each type of media. It does set the TV sleep timer though when viewing via Apple TV so I have to turn the TV back on an hour into streaming. Stilling working on trying to find the software setting to fix this. I use my iPhone as the remote for the Harmony so I have to look at the display in order to get the correct ‚Äúbutton‚Äù so I have gone back to using the cable remote to control the cable as I can do so by feel instead of by sight. Occasionally, the app loses volume control via the iPhone physical volume controls, but leaving and returning to the app corrects the issue.",0
This tool fails in that the handle is as thick as the business end of a baseball bat..virtually no taper and almost impossible to get a good grip. The handle should have a gripping area more like the gripping end of a baseball bat. The entire tool is just plain clumsy and cheap; I am sure it would not hold to rough use and of course the whole point of this kind of took is rough use. Just another cheap made in China tool that will do in a pinch but is severely lacking. Do yourself a favor and buy one from a reputable tool maker or forestry product maker like Stihl . I should have known better but was in a hurry.,0
You get what you pay for,0
Slow moving. Kept watching and waiting for it to get better. Just not my thing.,0
Some of the colors I needed did not work.,0
They didn‚Äôt fit in the tree I had,0
"... the necklace will not lay flat. I still wear it occasionally, but that really bugs me",0
"For the first few months this was a solid backpack. After 6 months of use, the handle strap has separated from the backpack. It appears to be under Jansport warranty, but we won't know if it can be repaired or replaced for the same product until we pay to ship it in and wait for two weeks. This backpack should have held up longer than 6 months with daily school use.",0
"I'm on the quest for durable, colorful socks. These socks tend to slide off my ankles when I walk compared to the C9 socks from Target. They are also thinner than the Target ones. I wouldn't recommend these.",0
Works good for a while and then the image gets faded and it looks awful. At this point is just a night light as the image on the ceiling is not even recognizable.,0
"Beautiful, but after a couple weeks wear it cracked all along the band and I wound up having to buy another.",0
"The eyelets have failed after a months use - love the material and the design, but it's a bit of a bummer that it's falling apart so quick.",0
"The set I received a few days ago is not the same set I received last year. Disclaimer: the original is branded ""Truly Bamboo"" (super soft bristles) while the new brushes are branded ""Truly Eco-Friendly"" (noticeably harder bristles and larger head). Disappointed in the inconsistency and will be looking elsewhere, as the new bristles are too harsh on my sensitive gums.",0
This successfully makes your food purple but has no taste. It also gives me the worst diarrhea.,0
"Not very bright, but works with my iphone. Won‚Äôt buy again.",0
Mine was cracked when I got it,0
"This plate holder looks just like the OEM version but is missing the electrical connector. I wasn't able to remove the piece from the old holder, and there's nothing in the instructions to address this issue. Notice the bare wires in the picture where the connector should be. I'll spend a few days looking for the piece, then I'm returning it if I don't find it.",0
"I purchased these back in July to have on hand to replace my old ones which l did in October, I have made maybe 30 copies and it‚Äôs already saying the ink is low. Not sure if it‚Äôs because l had the cartridges for 3 months before I used them or not very good quality cartridges. Giving it a two because l may have waited too long to use them.",0
Sadly the print is beautiful but the shape is not that attractive. I had to return it.,0
Does not seem to last long,0
"I was so excited about this cup. As soon as it arrived I filled it with a few ice cubes and some cold water. Well, This water bottle sweats terribly & then when I had to tilt it up a little bit to get a sip, it leaked all over my lap. I am very disappointed,",0
"I‚Äôve had this thing for several days and I just can‚Äôt get it to accurately assess distance. Heart rate, or calories. What‚Äôs the point then?? Even the heart rate monitor reads ‚Äò_ _‚Äô most of the time. If that doesn‚Äôt work, the calorie count won‚Äôt be any better than a free online calorie calculator. So why bother spending money to wear this thing on your wrist. Unless you really like cheap watches. At least it seems to be water resistant.",0
Very bright but doesn't turn off when exposed to natural or artificial light. Wouldn't buy again,0
The parakeets won't use the coconut. They hut it with their beaks sometimes but that is it. I am disappointed that it is so small. It looked bigger in the pictures. Seems to be sturdy and the birds wint get hurt.,0
"Well, certainly not for natural, full breasted women. Zero support. Loved the deep red color. Too bad my girls looked worse in this than au natural. Sent it back.",0
"The cups are okay, although a little flimsy. They come in an unsealed plastic bag. Unfortunately Amazon shipped it with 2 bottles of shampoo, which leaked a little bit and gave out a strong scent. They should really be more careful because people may actually use these for their medicine.",0
The color is not as described. It's much a much lighter blue then the picture. I think the shadowing in the picture may be a bit deceiving.,0
"Sound is good and pairs easily with computer. The ""user manual"" is not very clear (broken English) especially regarding the light controls. Appears to be working okay, although we are still trying to figure it out. Clear instructions on how to navigate the light modes would be very helpful.",1
"If you want a stylish quartz watch for cheap, this is a decent one. I have had the dark leather and black one for 3 years wearing it on and off. It has some scratches, but looks ok still. The chronograph stopped working properly some time ago, but not a big deal to me. The crown is fragile, so be careful when you pull it out and adjusting the time.. This one has not fallen out like my other timex before it. Overall, i like it for the money.",1
"Difficult to open/close, but good for freezer stuff like fruit.",1
This was a great way to merge the different stories together with the overlapping time line. Loved seeing Lucy and Harris work through everything and my goodness that ending. I also love just how strong Lucy's relationship is with both Jesse and Drake.,1
The leg part comes off too quickly,1
Worked great til it didn't. But customer service is awesome and replaced it right away.,1
"This book had me smiling almost the entire time. Bodie... well... He is certainly up there with the best book boys ever. I loved almost everything about Penny and the way Bodie handled her baggage just made him all that much better. <3 The entire Tonic crew makes brief appearances, and I can only hope Veronica's story is next... and something leads me to believe hers intertwines with someone we already know. :) This was a fun read, and I know going into a Staci Hart book it will be a funny and yet steamy ride the entire way. She certainly didn't disappoint!",1
Really fine detail. Bought for my nurse wife. She loved it!,1
"Super bright. The light color is excellent. Very smooth on the dimming, NO flickering. Very slight delay on startup, but not nearly as bad as some CFL bulbs. Only complaint is that they seem to only dim to about 50%, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.",1
Fitbit band is comfortable and secures easily... nice color selections as well,1
A couple of kinky chemists take up a fantasy relationship with their Secretary. The fantasy soon becomes reality and the hotness explodes.,1
"Fantastic for cold - decent for hot. Well-designed and works pretty much as advertised. Coffee does not stay hot that long, but cold drinks are great. Ice stays frozen long after drink is gone.",1
Great product especially if you live in an apartment or dorm. Only con is sometimes there is lint on the clothes after they are washed and dried. Dryer works well but you usually have to wait a day for the clothes to be dry enough to wear.,1
"Rebecca Zanetti delivers another heart pounding thriller with Taken. It‚Äôs also a second chance romance. Faye and Hunter are former foster kids and sweethearts, but they‚Äôve been apart for more than 5 years. Add in other old foster friends and an unexpected half-sibling and there‚Äôs a lot of great action and dialogue. I love all her sorrows, and this one is no exception.",1
Love the suction . Gives you the right sensation you want with adjustment . Nipples enlarge and very sensitive when used .I use them regularly and my nipples are longer and very sensitive constantly.,1
Kids like it but I'm noticing that they push too hard and the surface rubs off leaving the underneath picture showing through in streaks.....not ideal but the kids so far don't care!,1
"Well... to lower your pH more quickly, use muriatic acid... but be careful. This product is much safer, but not as potent in bringing levels down, and takes longer. I have both on hand.",1
Great kitty litter box. It took our kitten a day to get use to it. The appearance of the litter box is attractive as far a litter boxes go. And the lid on top does help with not having litter tracked all over the house. Love it!,1
Work as needed. Make sure the straps are very tight! They tend to roll on the side and get your shoes in what you are trying not to get them in.,1
I have lost about 35lbs in the last 6 months.using meal prep. I use about eight of these containers a week. They are durable they clean well and they don't leave a weird taste in food even after 5 or 6 days. I would caution you to be careful about the lids. I have lost two and broken one in the course of regular daily use. These are a good investment; but in a year or two when I need to buy more I'm sure it will be because if a list shortage.,1
Pros: looks and feels great. Stones are small enough that everyone thinks they are real. Cons: scratches easily,1
durable and great price could use better feet to help protect floors beneath.,1
"Works good. And doesn't contain anti-freeze, plastics or any other of the dozen or so chemicals found in most off-the-shelf hair goo. Would rather have it fragrance free.",1
Looks great. Easy to install. Will probably buy again for additional storage needs.,1
Nice hawk. Throws very well if you know how to throw it. First time throwing stuck 5 out of six. Very sharp. Only thing I dislike is sheath. Hard to configure it to get hawk in and out rapidly. Still good for storing though.,1
This was great quality. Worth the buy for my husband.,1
It is slightly smaller that advertised. Only an issue because I printed a large collage an some of the images on the outer edge were small. Single images will likely print great as long as there is not anything on the edge of the photo. Best bet is to be very cognizant of the cropping.,1
"I‚Äôm one of those bakers that can make something taste great but really struggle making it look pretty. I was sick of wonky pies that didn‚Äôt look as good as I wanted them to, and spending way too much trying to braid a pie crust only to have it turn out uneven and sloppy looking. For that reason, I LOVE THIS. It is so incredibly easy to use and really helps take your crust to the next level in a matter of seconds. I personally still struggle getting the decorations to stick onto the crust and not just fall off after baking, but that‚Äôs user error all the way. Buy this, it‚Äôs worth it and saves so much time.",1
Nice sound. It didn‚Äôt hurt the budget. Small enough to take anywhere,1
"Looks, works great, but could use a heavier backing.",1
This is New Weight Watchers Instant Pot Freestyle Cookbook.This is latest 2019 addition.Selected & Delicious recipes in this book.,1
These are so cute and easy to apply but they haven‚Äôt been holding up that well over time (about 2 months now) Would still but again but be gentle with them.,1
I liked how easy it was to apply and made a difference right away.,1
"Great chair, just wish the wire for the massage pad was longer other than that good product",1
Not as large as I thought.,1
"This Air Fryer Cookbook Will Instantly Revolutionize Your Kitchen Become an Air Fryer Master and Impress Your Family, Friends and Guests! It cooks brisk, tasty and sound suppers and what better to combine with your air fryer than an extraordinary cookbook with heaps of great formulas. The formulas are easy to take after and numerous I can make with fixings I as of now have in the house. The Air Fryer book is committed to both meat eaters and veggie lovers, and it's ideal for learners, and additionally experienced cooks.",1
"The massager is pretty simple to use. I like the length, it wraps the body well. I mostly use it in the stomach area for a few minutes, and interestingly after a few days it felt like the ab muscles had worked out, because it felt a bit tight. The massager says to not use it for more than 15 minutes in an area. The cord is pretty long, which is nice. And the remote for it is so simple, it's just a knob to change the intensity of the vibration. I like that you can take the massager out of the velcro wrap/pouch thing. I think the only annoying thing for me is the zipper, when I have the massager ON, due to the vibrations, the zipper starts tapping on the zipper teeth. Overall, I think the massager is pretty useful.",1
"Seems very difficult to find a full coverage powder that looks and feels smooth and not chalky, but this is an excellent example of both! The color is slightly darker than usual; I am very pale and always use the lightest color of any cosmetic line. Apart from being slightly darker than others, I am very satisfied!",1
Great looking item! Too cute but waist runs very small!!!!,1
"I‚Äôm coming down from 17 years of anti seizure meds and the number one side effect is brain fog. These seem to help my brain to connect, when I remember to take them. I‚Äôll probably buy another bottle.",1
Nice quality- heavier than I expected.,1
"My male Shih Tzu loves his collar & matching leash. We were using a shabby-looking set which he felt was beneath his dignity. When I saw the custom collar & leash, it looked great. It's made of leather -- which looks rich -- & customized with his name & my phone number made the sale for us. I would have rated it 5-stars except the printing on the name plate is ink or an equally non-permanent substance. Wish it had been engraved.",1
will use them on hard seat church pews,1
"I like the crisp matte look of the case. However, the top piece seems significantly lighter than the bottom piece otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed. Possibly because the top is supposed to have the matte finish and the bottom is just a solid color I assume.",1
"This backpack has two large compartments of which the front one is rather narrow thus not allowing much bulky packing. The front compartment has several dividers for organizing pens, phone etc and the back one has a laptop sleeve and can fit a little more bulkier items (such as your lunch). This is a great backpack for commuting to work or carrying around the city on a regular day. It's not really designed for travel or hiking. The front ""leather"" material looks great. I initially had some trouble with the front zipper (due to the way the backpack was bent when shipping) but it quickly resolved itself. I highly recommend this item if you are in need of a smaller back pack that looks as good as a briefcase.",1
"Kind of wish this had a larger hole in it where the phone camera looked through so that both cameras on an iPhone could be used but that‚Äôs my fault for not paying attention, other than that I‚Äôve only used this once right when I got it and it did what it is supposed to do! Can‚Äôt wait to use it out in the mountains!",1
I truly enjoyed reading this book. I didn‚Äôt see it ending as it did and it definitely kept my attention.,1
"Easy to set the combo, feel cheap in your hand.",1
"Those compatible toner cartridges are always a bit of a gamble and I already made bad experience with some. But this one worked like a charm. Installation was super easy, the printer recognized it immediately, and the print outs look great. What else can you ask for? Hopefully it will print as many pages as advertised.",1
Great quality! Fast shipping.,1
A few fell off the wall. Not real sticky. But some worked well. Go figure.,1
good replacement good price,1
"Not as rigid or enveloping as I thought, but I suppose it does its job. Sometimes comes off a bit in my pocket.",1
They are very cute but cheaply made.,1
"I am very pleased with this phone case. It‚Äôs really pretty too. The only small complaint I have is that pushing the volume and power buttons is a little tricky but can be done, I also think that once the case softens up in those areas it will become easier. I would definitely buy another case like this one.",1
Great value. I use these to work on engines. They will tear if you catch them on something but otherwise provide good protection.,1
These little lights were just not quite as bright as I needed but they are easy to use and would be good for a small space.,1
"The picture shown is of an assembled finished piece. The item is well made and beautifully painted, but comes unassembled; I assume since there are 24 small toys, this is so the toys can be put in the compartments and one taken out each day to complete the display at the end of advent, which is why it comes unassembled. However, the toys are very small and fall over easily, especially when you wind the base to play the music. I also feel they could easily be lost, so I glued the pieces down to make them permanent and will put fun treats; i.e., Hershey kisses, miniature peanut butter cups, etc. in the compartments. The compartments are small, each holding about 2 Hershey kisses, so if you want to put gift cards or larger candies in them, it will not work. Not all fun size candy bars will fit.",1
Just what I needed works great.,1
"This was the go-to stuff for our ancestors. . Studies show it to be very nearly as effective as antibiotic ointments still. Lubricates, protects, weather resists, etc. all sorts of stuff. Do a web search and you'll go back to it and save money too.",1
Very pretty and perfect rose gold color but the latex balloons didn't hold up well. They lasted less than 24 hours.,1
Super cute and great material. 36ddd bit tight but workable and great for sucking in the tummy,1
They are nothing special but they get the job done. Just a little annoying to get the bottom bolt and screw to line up because the screw isnt that long.,1
"We no longer have any landline phones but do have a landline for another purpose which requires occasional troubleshooting. This somewhat barebones device allows for us to test for a dial tone and make and receive a test call, exactly what we needed it for.",1
Soft and comfortable.,1
"This glue gun is a beast! It will go through some glue sticks fast, but it will glue just about anything! It gets REALLY hot. *Update* After some light use I noticed the nozzle leaks a little and it will mess up whatever surface you leave it on, so I have to be mindful to always keep something under it while in use.",1
The nylon material feels sturdier than other shades. I purchased the XL size. For a Honda Fit the top to bottom measurement is good however the side length is a bit long and it doesn't fit into the windshield frame like the photo. But it still does the job.,1
"Great material and fit. Very durable. They hug your body and feel great. Very stretchy, and material doesn't show moisture.",1
Excellent for eliminating splatter in the microwave.,1
it fits well with the exception it is a bit snug across the shoulders and bust area,1
"I assumed these were all the same type of product, usable on both hardwood and carpet floor. There are actually 2 types, half for carpet and half for hardwood. I used the hard sided ones (for carpet?) under my dryer and extremely heavy washer, on our garage which is concrete covered in epoxy. They work great for this purpose! I couldn't even move the washer 1 inch before. Not sure how the felt ones will work. 1 star taken away only for the lack of clarity regarding the product.",1
Not as sticky as I would Have liked.,1
My best friend wanted to try this. She thought it was going to be amazing. I‚Äôm not impressed. I‚Äôd rather use wax. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It pulled my skin if it wasn‚Äôt super hot. And if it was hot enough to come off easily it burned my skin.,1
"Nice theme for my autumn bathroom. The image is not as vibrant as I imagined, but I'm content.",1
"Nice handbag. Just right size. Only problem was when I unpacked it, it smelled like cigarettes.",1
"I like the feel of the bed, but it is very flat, more of a mat and my dog won‚Äôt sleep on it at night. He does love it during the day. Go figure.",1
"Works well, does slide down a little without tension but overall good two point sling.",1
Perfect for those occasions you don't need a super long cord! Highly recommend.,1
"Great product, but still missing the standard cover with lyrics.",1
Nice wallet but it sets off the metal detectors at the airport. I have to put the wallet in my bag.,1
"I like everything about the wig except the color, and that‚Äôs my fault for not looking carefully enough. It would look better on a woman of color or an olive complexion or even a younger person. The base color is black rather than brown, which is what I need. Still, the style is cute, very spiky and ther is a lot of hair so that it could be trimmed or thinned if you wanted.",1
Not super happy w color. But I still love this brand.,1
Absolutely looooove this case!!! Fits iPhone XS Max perfectly!!! It is a bit heavy due to the backside being all glass. I‚Äôm also extremely careful to not drop or bang the case as I‚Äôm assuming it would shatter because of the glass backing. Brought this case solely for looks & it truly is very very gorgeous! I get compliments daily & I‚Äôve had this case for a month or so now. I would not recommend this case if you‚Äôre looking for solid protection from dropping or banging your phone.,1
The brush is small yet solid and does a bang-up job on removing embedded hair on brushes. Will purchase for others as gifts - thank you!,1
I used this product before the winter rains and I think it helped the overall appearance of my grass in the front yard.,1
"Is it as effective as a gas trimmer? No. Is it more effective than other battery powered trimmers? Yes. Conclusion: It has it's place, but wish it had a little more power.",1
Decently constructed for a cheap China product. I didn't see any major sewing flaws. Washed in cold water and air dried before first use. Totally useable.,1
Beautifully written. Missing deeper understanding of motivations and objectives. Characters suffer from existential floating. But that may be common to terrorist acts.,1
"Some adjustment is needed in order to get this hanging basket to look like the picture. Actually, a lot of adjustment. Fortunately the stems, which are overly long, do bend if patiently worked with and in time I'll be happier with the ""look"" of this basket than I presently am. A few more blossoms would have been nice, too, but overall this faux-plant definitely looks like a geranium. The colors and the leaf/blossom sizes are excellent. So while it's still a work-in-progress, I'm reasonably pleased with this purchase and actually am enjoying remodeling it.",1
Rated to 220 lbs and looks very sturdy. Not as small as I hoped as it just folds. Harder to backpack due to size (reason for 4-star rating.,1
I've been pretty happy with this cushion after using it for several months now. The only issue I have with it is that is tends to slip around a bit.,1
"Quick read, good for busy moms who don't have a lot of time. Inspirational. To the point. Looking forward to reading more of her books!",1
not enough of a challenge,1
"This mini amp is super cute looks just like the picture but it's plastic guys (you know what, whatever it's cute anyway)",1
"This has to be one of the nicest mandolin's I have owned. Not only does it have every attachment, but it's easy to use and the blades stay fairly sharp for a while. It is easy to clean and stows away nicely.",1
I liked this product. On the top of container there is a 20% off second order. I scanned but did not receive code so I paid full price for second container. Disappointed!,1
"This shampoo has a nice lather and it is good and concentrated, so a little goes a long way. The smell is slightly medicinal, but not overpowering or bothersome for you or the dog. I wash the dog twice, first time to get past the oil/dirt layer, the second to get to the skin so it can work its anti-itch magic. I'm sure this helps alleviate some itchiness, but there are many things that can make a dog itch. If it does not improve seek advice from a veterinary professional.",1
"I don‚Äôt know why they use the word plush in their description, that is misleading. But for the money these do what they are supposed to do. They cushion the sharp edge of the seatbelt. They are very well constructed & I recommend them as long as you are not looking for something that is very soft & cushy. I feel that I definitely got my money‚Äôs worth & I‚Äôm happy with my purchase!",1
Work pretty well. Quite bright and compatible with most transformers. They are quite small so can be hidden if you wanted.,1
good little cart for short people,1
More bleed through than I'd like. Will look for a different journal when I'm done with this one.,1
"so far they have been what I have ordered, only had for a week now but was what I wanted.",1
"I can only give it 4 stars at the moment, but the product is very well priced, and the product I just started taking",1
Rings are small need a 12 not an 10 on both rings returning them for a bigger size,1
"I tried it on when it arrived and it appears it will fit. I'm hoping it will block the sun, but since it's winter, I can't say for sure. Seems like a nice product though and I'm excited to have it.",1
I was hoping for something a little more sturdy. When I sit on this my butt eventually sinks all the way down. Its only a temporary cushion.,1
"The feather of the necklace was way bigger than I had expected so i couldn't use it for it's original purpose. It's so big it just looks tacky, in a way? The earrings are cute. Overall, they're not bad, I just don't think I will personally wear them much.",1
Good information about the servants in the White House. The president home has an intriguing history.,1
"I've been getting nonstop compliments about these shoes! I got the light peachy pink ones. They fit very well with and without socks. However buyers should definitely know these are NOT for extended walking, hikes, etc. They are just not built for that, and your feet will ache.",1
These are actually lighter and slightly smaller (ear cups) than the previous generation. These also feel a little flimsy but they sound fantastic. The microphone is crystal clear. I can't comment on the battery life yet.,1
This is a nice set. Everything you need to get started. Lots of seeds so if some don‚Äôt start you have more to try. I planed my seeds 4 weeks ago and some of them still haven‚Äôt come up I‚Äôm going to give them another week then add more seeds see if they will Come up. But all in all it‚Äôs a great starter set.,1
"Still not sure why people are so scared of Pennywise, but I did enjoy the movie. I haven't seen the new one, but I watched this intentionally beforehand so that I could review both. It was entertaining, but SUPER long lol",1
Fit to size. Like them a lot,1
Works great. Really helps stop my allergies,1
"I like them. They just don't have a great range of distance. And sometimes tilting my head or just moving around, when reaching for stuff the sound goes in and out. I like how they sit around my neck without falling. Actually pretty comfortable. Be careful if you wear a pull over hoodie. I have thought I lost them just to find them inside the hoodie. For the price they are good.",1
"Worked right out of the box. I have an 18v Dewalt drill. Would give 5stars, but I haven‚Äôt tried to charge them yet.",1
"I installed the lighting on the back of my 70"" TV. I quickly found that the USB port is always hot (powered) on this TV, so I need to use the included remote to manually turn the light strips on and off. I found the remote to be non-functional. I tried a new battery which did not work. After trying everything I could think of, I contacted the seller. I was told they would gladly send me a replacement unit, which they did. I got a replacement unit and everything works. I am very happy with the lighting and how it enhances our movie-watching experience.",1
I just received the watch and I am very impressed. Too bad the Radio Controlled Timekeeping does not seems to work in my country.,1
Love this case! Only gave 4 stars because black was the only color option.,1
Good product and have reordered several times. My vet recommended this for my dog as we were having to get her glands expressed every 1 1/2 weeks. When I first started using this that time frame expanded to 1 1/2 months. I was so excited to find something to help. After using for nearly a year that time frame has shorted to about once every month. Still much better than every 10 days. I will continue to order this product. Much better option over risky surgery.,1
It‚Äôs a mazing as i need. It will be perfect if there is 2 sizes because it will useful for the kids also.,1
"I really liked the product, the smell was amazing and it felt so nice in my hair. It worked through my hair really easily and smoothly. Usually when I dry my hair I'll have to put coconut oil in it to keep it from frizzing up, but just using this seemed to do just fine. It also didn't leave my hair heavy or greasy like a lot of other masks have.",1
Not too complicated of plot...entertaining afternoon reading...charaters well developed...some interesting twists. Would recommend to friends if interested in this genre,1
"I really loved using this, when ever I travel outside the country without forgetting I carry this item.",1
Product seems to be working.,1
"This was what i needed, my only issue is in the instructions for putting together. Very unclear on pictures and no words to help explain. We redid twice and not sure its how its supposed to be but it works, lol",1
This is so adorable. Don't be put off by the thin material yes it's very thin material but you got to consider the price you're paying for it. But honestly it's so cute. When you get it definitely put it on because it looks actually much better on then you'd think. Runs small but I figured that and ordered a size larger for myself.,1
"bag. I was not dissapointed , big enough for my cloth for a week. I had it for carry on in the plane. The zippers were good, almost going to easy. I also think the bag looks nice.",1
"This book book took me some times to read, as it detailed history and the behavior of the Democratic Party. Some of the book I agree with and some I don't. It obviously is one sided, but not without being an education to read.",1
"The badge clasp seemed a little loose when arrived but I just put a dab of glue on it and it holds well now! Very cute, I get compliments on it all the time!",1
"I was looking for a pair of workout type shorts to walk the dogs and lounge around the house. I bought these and even though they are technically sleep shorts, they work just fine. I am 22 weeks and I can wear these throughout the whole pregnancy and even post- baby. They are a thin cotton material but not see through. Would recommend if you are looking for a comfy pair of shorts to wear during and even post pregnancy!",1
Great for a studio that is in its beginner stages!,1
"Comfortable,light.good for running,walking and off trail. Great price. Not too expensive because I like to change my shoes every 6-8 months",1
"These are very nice and well made, for the price they are an excellent value!",1
"Surprisingly good dress for the price. I bought it to use for a costume and it fit pretty well. Armpits are a bit tight, I ended up cutting off the cap sleeves for comfort.",1
The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing. I yanked out the spring with a small screwdriver... just get under there and yank it till it breaks free. I also replaced the blade with harder carbide steel. I use it quite often and it's part of my EDC.,1
They work great! sound great.. I should've paid attention to the sizes.. the tiny one is TINY!!!!!,1
Very sturdy and soft to hold.,1
"The paint on these blocks makes them a bit slick. We‚Äôre having trouble keeping our tower together because there‚Äôs not quite enough friction to prevent sliding. We like the colors very much though, and it works great for a homeschool game we play.",1
"This is exactly what I'm looking for. However, when I put these on, there is a lot of space and extra fabric (way too big). My left hand measures at 18 cm and right hand at 19.5 cm so I ordered a size Small according to the table, but they're still too big. Would be great if these were also available in XS.",1
Bought this for my son's switch when he stays at grandma's. High quality second dock at much cheaper price than Nintendo. Hope it lasts!,1
Great mask..could improve the strap connections but still recommend,1
I'm not noticing any benefits to taking this. Might not be what I need.,1
"My battery was dying and the capacity was reduced to 60% after 3.5 years of usage, battery life was reduced to 3-4 hours with moderate use. After installing the battery(which is pretty easy if you have the screwdrivers) the capacity is back to 100% again. The battery life is back to ~7 hours. I have lenovo yoga 900 and you can watch the iFixit video for step by step guidance to replace the battery",1
These are pretty good and the price is right. But an inch of that four inches is not ridged so the biggest thing you can zip it around is about 7/8ths of an inch.,1
I bought this for my new Fire tablet. It fits well.. as advertised. I bought this rotating/stand up style because I want to be able to read a book while seated eating or relaxing. It does not stand at a great enough angle. I would like it to be a bit more upright at the highest standing level (there are 2).,1
My little dog loves these. We use them as special treats.,1
I bought my husband one of these for Christmas last year & he loves it!! My 13 year old son played with his so much that I decided to get him one for his birthday. He plays with the magnetic cube more than he does his video games!! I love it & it‚Äôs a quiet toy that he can take to church which helps so much with his ADD!!,1
"I wasn't sure what this was when I bought it. It has a fan underneath which lifts it off the flop slightly. The toy itself is very light and not very big. In my picture, you can see my hand covers it. Anyway, it is easy to move along the floor and has foam around the sides the make it bounce off of anything it hits.",1
Fan on light is loud but great quality light overall for the price I would recommend it,1
"purchased this because all of the tempered glass protectors kept cracking all the time even without dropping my phone. this screen protector feels like vinyl and even though I didn't watch the installation video, iI was able to install without a problem. Due to the liquid application, I found you can respray and start over if you made a mistake. The only thing I had to get used to is my finger didn't slide easily when swiping or playing games but it seems to have gotten better.",1
Really like these products and will buy more!!,1
"Slight electrical smell when turned on. Very light, reasonable suction and good overall quality and value.",1
Works great for the older xbox,1
"The item is nice, did the work, fits nice and looks nice. Good price.",1
"Came safely bubble wrapped. Haha. The only bad-ish thing was that there were large pink marks underneath bulbasaur's feet. Not a big deal since you wouldn't see it when it's standing, but it was a gift so I hope it didn't look too cheap. My friend seems to really like it though.",1
Sensitive but NOT syrupy dealing with great loss and the journey back to God. Faith and healing can seem such an insurmountable task and this book deals with the process beautifully. I especially like the awareness that all of creation knows God. I loved this book.,1
I have had these pads on for about a month. Works as expected.,1
Exceeded expectations for the price.,1
Mine had a small shipping error and arrive with a tiny hole. This tiny hole ruined some of my bathroom products with dark purple dye. It washes off of plastic easily but not out of clothing. With that said it works really great as a dye. I was using it as a purple tint for my hair and I'm sure I didn't use it right as results were blotchy and uneven. The product I have no problem I just don't have a lot of experience.,1
This phone mount is pretty great. Feels solid. Easy to insert my iPhone. This has actually helped me to not be on my phone as much while driving. That's a win on its own.,1
"I really like the personalization, but I feel the wreath could have used a tab bit of color. The gold on the ribbon wasn't as noticeable as it looked in the photo.",1
Big girls get love too. They say they need it. No they get it !!! A great read with a twist,1
"It's nice to have the remote control, but it doesn't work if you're more then ten or so feet away. The lights are cute, but start much brighter and dim down along the line (as seen in the photo - the beginning and end of the lights are shown). The color is a warm white/yellow, but it doesn't send out much light. Would be happier if the lights were consistently bright.",1
"I read the reviews and other than folks who were putting the thing on backwards (the holes won't line up!!), the most common complaints are the screws are too soft and that the screws are too long and bind up the bolt. I did not run into either of these problems. I screwed the base down, mounted some rings, and away I went. Works great and was an inexpensive solution. Is it super high end?? No. Is it adequate for what's likely 99% of the users out there? In my opinion, yes.",1
The actual toy is great but it doesnt Stop until you switch it off Very annoying!,1
"works and fits perfect as described, I didn't like the sticky tape they used for wrapping, it won't go off even after washing or scrubbing.",1
"I have been using this shaver for several months and I do like it. It's light weight and the battery has excellent lift. The only thing a bit disappointed is sometimes it hurts me when I didn't shave for several days, other than that, everything is good!",1
"I tend to drop my phone a few times more then I should. I have ordered this item twice and both times it happen to break in the same spot and even though I was annoyed, the case did its job and protected my phone. . So great job.",1
Good quality. It served its purpose for a costume.,1
"Its a wallet. I ordered a wallet. It holds my driver's license, other Id.and a few ones. That's what I ordered and it arrived when you said it would.",1
"This soundbar works great for movies, TV, etc. If you're looking for a deep-bass, it isn't here.",1
Looks the same as pictured. Good quality.,1
"Very compactable and light weight. The stakes are durable and tie out points are well made. Wish it had a few more tie outs on the sides. Mine only came with one on each corner, one in the middle of each side and a center tie out. Used this as a lean-to shelter over my tent. The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch.",1
"Has worked on 7mm thick hunting waders with 1200 gram winter boots. Kind of expensive for a plastic hanger that could break, but so far so good. Hanger should have been made thicker.",1
Interesting details about making wine in France. Sometimes the story and characters sounded a bit tired.,1
Would definitely recommend. I am super pleased.,1
I really like it and it works very well. My only complaint is that this is the second one I've purchase and the 2nd time the plastic black comb has broken. Is there anyway to get that piece replaced?,1
"These wireless, bluetooth headphones mostly deliver as advertised. They are very lightweight, the sound quality is on par for what I'd expect, the battery life gets close to 3 hours, and I really like the idea of carrying case, although it would be even better if the top of it stayed attached when you open them. The hardest part for me was understanding how to get both of them to play music simultaneously. Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears! I'll add that one other nice feature is having a separate charging cord that goes straight into the earbuds. With certain competition, the earbuds need their charging case or they can't charge, so kudos on the design here.",1
"I bought this for my 8year old for Christmas. He reviewed it: I really like this set. I like that their are different colors, but I really wanted a red set, but it's ok because there were lots of colors at least. I like to set them up and shoot them with my Tie Fighter guns and dart guns.",1
The car seat is perfect. The stroller has a lesser quality to it but overall it suits the needs. The backing has no stiffness to it.,1
"Although it works as described, the flow is not as effective as a powered irrigator since it works by gravity. Otherwise it's fine for use on the go. The seller was prompt and honest.",1
These lights are OK for a small area to highlight. They are a bit delicate and maybe not as bright as one would expect.,1
"After a third request to write a review of your product, I give up! So here goes, it's paper and you put it into the printer and it prints. I don't know what more I can say.",1
"I like the fact that I received this merchandize as promise but when I open the box I was dissappointed to see how small the coffee mug was. I was expecting to see a bigger size for the price of $13.99 that I pay, that‚Äôs why I gave 4 star.",1
Defective parts in the box. But the company replaced them with no issues.,1
"I started breaking out randomly for no reason at all, so I did some research and found out that Milk Thistle helps detox. So I was search on Amazon for a Milk Thistle supplement and stumbled across this supplement. Needless to say, I no longer have the blemishes that were appearing on my chest and arm and I feel like I have more energy. So I am very satisfied with this product .",1
"these are okay, hard for my weak fingers to get placed properly. I have to have help, then they are very nice.",1
"Product is great, especially for the price. The only negative is that it is a sticker and I wish it were engraved. We have had this license plate for almost 2 years now and it is holding up perfectly, I do not notice any signs of wear. I would purchase this again.",1
"I received a gift of a himalayan salt lamp last year and have been enjoying its benefits so I decided to buy more to put around the house. I initially bought 2 from this seller due to high ratings and rave reviews. The first 2 arrived and they were beautiful, just the perfect brightness and glow, they were both very different shapes and glow and I loved the fact that it is dimmable, perfect when you want it to be not too bright when sleeping. I ordered another 2 the next day but this time one of them came a bit short of the quality I was expecting. I am aware no 2 lamps are alike and there will be irregularities in the form but this one had gray dark streaks that looked like mold around it and the light was concentrated only on the base of the lamp and the top third half just looked like a pink salt block, I am returning one of them. I guess 3 out of 4 is not bad, hence the 4 stars. Update: As soon as my review posted on Amazon Levoit contacted me directly, refunded my money and told me I didn‚Äôt need to go through the hassle of sending the defective salt lamp, truly impressive customer service. Due to this, I have bought 4 more lamps to give as gifts and all of those arrived in perfect condition and are all excellent lamps.",1
"So hard to put air into this hammock! It is fun, but then the chances of actually getting air into this hammock is pretty low. There's just something about it that makes it so hard to put air into. There was only ONE time out of the 3 that I was actually able to put air into it and it was awesome!!! Other than that, it was not. It was too much work to put air into that I had to make it some kind of a game. I mean, there's just too big of a hole to close off when air is being put into the hammock. I can't say it can hold 440 pounds either. I think it was more like 200 pounds at the most. Any more than that, it will start to flatten. When it was inflated perfectly, many of us were able to hang on the sides and float around. Two of us were able to lay on it without drowning. The mesh actually stayed in one piece too. No rip whatsoever. The fastening of the buckle doesn't make sense to me, but if it works then that is all that matters. I just need to get used to the buckling, I guess. I gave this hammock 4 stars because the idea of a hammock that requires swinging around in a circle to put air into it is cool to me. When it is inflated, it is fun. When it is deflated, it is space saving. And when it is being used, it becomes a fun water activity. Just be careful with it though. The nylon and mesh feels thin, but it can still last a while if taken care of correctly and carefully. Thank you!",1
"I consider this filter very user friendly. Came with everything you need and the instructions were easy to follow-- my favorite part , I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this filter was.",1
Somewhat large but reordering in a smaller size. The material wasn't what I thought but still nice. Hopefully the smaller size will fit perfectly.,1
"Mr. Smith puts his heart out there for everyone to see -- and by so doing, shows that we all share a common bond with our children, whether they're ours by blood or simply by association and choice. This is a sad, amazingly honest, courageous and ultimately empowering book for anyone who has experienced the loss of a loved one (including, most especially, a child.)",1
Exactly as ordered but the lid came cracked. We tried to glue unsuccessfully.,1
Nice set. Set is smaller than I thought. Tongs are really small.,1
"This USB 3.0 compatible DVD drive was very easy to install and worked well right out of the box. The optical reader can be a little noisy but that's a minor inconvenience. Does exactly what it's supposed to do, in a very thin form factor.",1
That was sufficiently weird for a 'I recommend at least starting to watch the film' recommendation. You won't get answers; it's a hot mess ... but it's an unusual hot mess which you _might_ like.,1
"fast, friendly and item as described!",1
"Nice, durable gloves, but I should have gotten medium instead of large. I like to wear them inside mittens in very cold weather and they don't fit in the mittens I bought to go with them.",1
"Had this wallet for a few weeks now. It‚Äôs decent if your carrying only a few bills, no area for change. Keeps your wallet simplistic and quality is decent.",1
sometimes cliche but overall really fun to read. made me laugh a lot. if ur looking for a fun book and dont mind cliche romance its pretty great! then again im not really a big fan of romance in general so im probably biased,1
"I like the high waisted leggings I purchased. They fit well, as advertised and are comfortable. Would have liked a little bit heavier material, but very satisfied and would order again.",1
Relatively good price for what you get. Simple to use.,1
"Work well and cap keeps them clean! I like that the plunger functions in a way that nothing is wasted. Be careful of putting the caps on too far though, I did and cracked quite a few of them. The plunger stick is a bit flimsy but doesn‚Äôt impact use. I would recommend being careful when dispensing though as the plunger will suddenly jar down when pressure is applied.",1
Haven't had it long enough to answer,1
Its OK for beginners.,1
We keep this out in the living room and just keep a few diapers in it instead of having a whole box laying around. I like how it has 3 individual dividers in it where we keep diapers in one wipes in another and keep the diaper rash cream in the final smaller spot. The handle makes it easy to carry around to other rooms as well just depends where my daughter decides to lay down and have her diaper changed. It's very well made and the stitching seems to be phenomenal. It's definitely worth having,1
I like the way it makes the phone looks now. Great privacy from the side view. Very easy to install get product overall.,1
"A great find a a great read! üòç If you really want to learn everything about Python and its system, read this book and you'll definitely go from a begginer to a pro! It's clearly and well written, my favorite is the tips and tricks books, you'll definitely have fun reading that one üòâ Nice book.",1
Looking forward to the next volume in this series.,1
"Good desk. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. Didn't like how the keyboard tray slides out, but I didn't need that anyway.",1
Perfect for the mending job.,1
Works well. But takes time,1
"Beginners version of escape room. There is a small attempt of a plot to explain why birds are in cages which you solve puzzles to get a key to free them. Graphics is great. Hints are free once you buy the game, price of a large latte coffee. But game can be solved in several hours.",1
"I enjoyed the twists in this well-written novel but some of it was pretty predictable. The characters were believable and interesting, and the plot suspenseful. I liked the time shifts from one chapter to the next.",1
I wish the shirt was a little more form fitting.,1
I liked the knitting shop setting in England.,1
They're decent little cutters. I used it for a model I was building and needed a cheap replacement till I could find my sturdier ones. Held up surprisingly well and did a decent job leaving smooth cuts. Isn't as flush as I'd like it so it's had to get perfect cuts. Not sure how good these would be at cutting wire but I imagine they'd do alright.,1
"Shirt runs small. I ordered the XL and I am newly a comfortable XL. It does not fit like the picture, order a size up if that is what you'd like. It is also pretty sheer, and too small at the chest to button. I plan to lose at least 10 more lbs so I will not return as I got it on a deal of the day and don't want to pay more for it.",1
A game that makes you use your brain.,1
Easy to set up and use. Good range. Better than AT&T phones we had before we bought these.,1
"The product provides more information than a normal scale, granted, I can't verify the accuracy of those numbers. However, if you use this for progress tracking rather than absolute number measurement, this would serve the purpose",1
Most comfortable boots I‚Äôve ever worn. Easy on and off. Very flexible,1
Product seems to ease inflammation or at least make it less of a problem. Have occassional reflux that may be caused by this product but its benefits outweigh the problem.,1
Great recipes for salt block cooking. Love that the pics are there to help guide you.,1
Product works as described. More comfortable than most standard dust masks and the added function of having the organic vapor filter layer is a big plus.,1
"optical zoom is great, but the algorithm used to provide focus correction actually fuzzes up the picture. This is written about in the reviews and is annoying at 40x optical zoom.",1
Thinner than most which is what I wanted!,1
"I like these socks for the most part. They are very thick and tall, perfect for winter. I was specifically looking for non-slip socks and they work well. The third picture is comparing the seam inside the sock with one from gerber. The one on the right is the one from Wiggle Toes. It does feel smooth for the most part, but there are bumps at the ends. My baby doesn‚Äôt seem to mind it but you might do a trial run if your child is sensitive to seams. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that they slip off easily and think it‚Äôs because they are too big. I purchased the size 1-3 which is supposed to be 6-12 months. My baby is 9 months old and they are still a bit big. I will try to update this review when she grows into them and if they still slip off.",1
Love this item! Purchased it for my aquatic therapy at the beach..,1
Worked well on one door but not the other.,1
Good all around. Not high end but for the price I expected less than what I got,1
"If some of these reviewers are looking for great literature: Learn Greek. I read this novel when it first came out in paperback in the early sixties. It has held up to the test of time as far as a novel goes. The sex and violence is not as new nor shocking as it was in those days. I think we have all become a bit jaded. Characters are well written, a novel to enjoy reading just for the sake of reading. A book that keeps your attention and moves right along.",1
"Great for long/big back yards, slightly annoying to set up, I take it down and set it up each day so my grass doesn‚Äôt burn.",1
didn't realize it had melatonin in it. it has a reverse affect on me and keeps me wired at night. does everything else it's supposed to do though.,1
Husband was dissatisfied with this wallet/phone cover. Eco-fused was great in responding to my concerns and gave me Another item free as a replacement. Their customer service is outstanding!,1
Edges wear off easily. Center graphic is slightly fuzzy in appearance. Otherwise great.,1
"This case is a good case. It protects my camera from accidental impacts and drops. It fits my point and shoot Canon snug and it has a pretty good padding surrounding the case. The spring loaded Enclosed hook seems sturdy enough to hold your camera secure to a belt loop, or carrying bag. Inside has a webbed compartment to hold flat objects such as an extra battery, SD card, lanyard or credit cards and cash. The compartment is really tight once you insert your camera and won't hold a lot, maybe one to the items I mentioned above. Overall it's a great secure case and will keep your camera safe just don't expect to hold to many accessories in it.",1
Actually works really great. I also put it on my eye brows and works great there too! ;-),1
"Cleans up the ends of the bars nicely. Stay in place better than the stock friction-fit rubber plugs. Weigh a few grams more though, so not for weight watchers...",1
It really works! I have rheumatoid arthritis and put it on my aching areas - it doesn't take the pain fully away but it helps a lot. I've found it doesn't work on my hands or feet but everyplace else it helps.,1
Has a great taste and not too oily,1
"While the dogs liked them, would've like to see a standard size",1
I gifted this to my BF. She used her 1st one and said it was great. She said they smell better after you remove them from the shrink wrap. Birthday gift success!,1
"I have to admit when I first got this and tried it, it seemed like it totally didn't work. I even had a hard time getting it into the device. I tried to instantly crimp the portion of the blind that was damaged and it didn't change it. It still looked damaged and bent. I was beginning to think 'what a waste of money.' I went away for a few minutes about to call Home Depot to see if they simply had new blinds in stock. Then I stopped myself and thought I'd better give it at least one last try. This time I held the damaged part in the device at a curve and held it for about 30-40 seconds. When I released it it had made it significantly better this time. Then I did kind of the same thing in three little areas on the same damaged part again to try and clean it up a bit more. I would say that made it better by another 20%. I think the key here is you have to hold the damaged part curved in the device for at least 40 seconds, maybe even pushing your thumb along it, and then kind of focus more on the nuanced parts of the same damage portion to try and clean it up after the first attempt. I would say if you are a patient person and are willing to treat the process as a kind of microscopic surgery to an extent as opposed to a job you can complete instantly then I think you'll appreciate this device. If the blinds are still hanging it's basically a situation of pulling up a chair for a good half hour and getting to work like a craftsman on them. Maybe you can speed up the process as you get good at it but just prepare yourself to treat it as if you were about to carve a small wood sculpture. It is rewarding though once you see them sort of come back to life. To add, this really works best on blinds that have been bent simply at a 90 degree angle rather than those that are actually mangled and bumpy. Like I said with the bumps it really takes a bit of work and nuanced focus to get those looking decent again.",1
Inflates easily and feels quite comfortable. Light and compact and the price is great! I will add to this review as I do more field testing.,1
I like them but they are for a pot of tea not just a single cup. My biggest complaint would be that the holes let little bits of tea out into the water.,1
"Cheap, you get what you pay for, but fun for play",1
"Machine was easy to assemble, and is small enough for easy storage. Moving the machine around is easy due to the lightness of it and the attached wheels. My only complaints are that the seat is a little hard, the accessory holder is not really big enough to hold a lot of remotes or anything else, and the iOS app that is included does not accurately track distance. When I get off the machine I will note the distance, time and calories burned but when I check on the app or website the distance is about 60% of what the machine/app reported during the workout itself.",1
"There is no doubt that it will protect the tablet, but it's a little bit thick and heavy!",1
Good quality batteries at a fraction of retail prices. Came in small envelope packaging. Did not have any expiration dates shown.,1
This game is fun and fun,1
"I haven't had a good rain since receiving my doormat but I washed (no soap) and dried (low heat) as directed and it looks and feels great. There was some shedding in the wash/lint in the drier, so I would definitely wash and dry by itself. It has not shed at all on my floor. Looking forward to testing it out in the rain later today and will update.",1
Nice but a couple of multiples out of 6 doesn't give very much variety. They are cute and small.,1
Nice little cake not a big one like I thought when I bought it just a baby cake,1
"I gave this book a four star rating because it lacked an epilogue, however I would recommend this book to all romantic readers because it had most of the important elements of a good read.",1
I thought it was a good value for the price,1
Worked for our hose support and storage for animal corral.,1
"No issues in terms of working ""straight out of the box"". It was duller than expected in comparison to others that we got that were considered warm white. So we wished it was a bit brighter.",1
"If you enjoyed sky high, or simply love recognizing D-list canadian actors, I would give this one a go. It's an inoffensive way to spend an hour or so with a satisfying resolution. I thought they put a fair amount of thought into the powers they gave the kids, which were pretty original, and the cgi could have been worse. Fairly average saving the world deal with kids that bond and shit. If there was a gun to my head over this movie I would say lay off the trigger, champ.",1
Love these shoes! So comfortable and great quality.,1
Super soft hair and flat iron lovely. If you like your hair full get 4 bundles. I will be ordering again v,1
"Nice suit, except that the bra pads fold up every time you wash the suit. Otherwise, would have gotten five stars.",1
Interesting but it seems more about him than Bess,1
"I love the quality of the syringe, it's just a little to think for what it's being used.",1
"My son loves this mat! The only issue I had was that it's not a doodle mat, there is no space for them to draw, it is just hidden dinosaurs, which for my son was amazing.",1
"These are a little expensive, but they will be well worth it if I don't have to continually replace the plastic washer. So far they are working great!",1
I‚Äôve read all of the Peridale mysteries in the last few months and have enjoyed everyone of them. Now I‚Äôm impatiently waiting for the next one to come out.,1
Love the look but the strap broke within 2 weeks,1
Like the jacket because it has so many pockets! The jacket is very comfortable and warm!,1
"Works as expected. Well made, and seems sturdy. I would recommend this.",1
I love the fact my car no longer is a mess!,1
"Helped me a lot with my neck pain, the battery lasts forever and it is ok to hold, as heavy as all the other models.",1
"I like this IWB Kydex holster very much. It fits comfortably. The only issue is the belt clip is a little to far from the holster and doesn't secure around the belt that well, which can cause the holster to sometimes come up a little out of the waist band area at times, but overall it works well.",1
"I love this brand. The similarity to Fir Coat is a little bit disappointing, and both of those are very close to Salem (although Salem lacks the holographic glitter and has a black base rather than a deep blue, the colors are very close by merit of being dark blue/greens). I've TRIED to provide photos of all three for comparison, but for some reason I'm unable. I like them all and don't regret the purchase at all, it's quite cute and even if it's very close to Fir Coat...well, it's very close to one of my favorites so that isn't exactly a bad thing. As for the brand and the polish quality itself, I love this brand and find it has a lot of staying power even with the considerable abuse that I put it through. It removes well when I want it to, but holds up very well.",1
Great for flat nipples. Helps to transition to breastfeeding.,1
So far the first impression is very slim and sleek. I haven‚Äôt tried it out yet,1
"I live on the edge of the rainforest in a Latin American country. A common pest here sre Geckos. After installing the gadgets, my wife and I noticed we had no more Geckos in the house within 3 days. As for other pests. It is still in the test area.",1
I use these for soup they work well,1
Work great. I make 5 lbs of butter a week. Wish they were a little longer,1
Like that is was simple and straightforward and the strategies can be implemented right away with ease.,1
"This has a snug and comfortable fitting and secures on my ear. I can listen to music secretly while working. Pairing is easy. There is no indicator light after pairing, totally invisible. With one earbud, it leaves one ear open to keep aware of my surroundings.",1
"This book, while sort of science fiction, has credible people and places. The pace is like a Dan Brown book",1
"It's a great fit. It makes the purse fuller . Maybe a little bulky ,but I love it",1
"Our work changed its dress code to more casual and I was looking for more jeans to fill out my wardrobe. As it's in the summer and I live in the South, these were the perfect boyfriend fit. The fit perfect. The wash is dark, but not too blue. They are comfortable and show off just enough of your ankle. I've worn them with flats and with heels.",1
Product was as described and delivered on time. Had one caliper with bad threads at brake connection port. They replaced item with no hassle. Would definitely use again. Great price.,1
"An odor still lingers from shipping...kinda musty odor.... hopefully will fade. Otherwise product is sturdy and suits my needs for extra seating, foot prop and eventually Afghan storage",1
"It is a nice looking chair. It was easy to assemble and arrived on time. I am not crazy about the wheels, they get stuck a lot.",1
i can't get picture from my phone to my pc. Has an excelent picture.,1
"This is a very warm boot. It is simple, yet stylish and comfortable. The first few times you wear them, your socks will get stained. The inside of the boot is dyed red just like the outside! The boots run big, so go down a size as the boots will stretch out over time and your feet will eventually slip out of them! My only complaint is that the boots get dirty easily, but you can clean them!",1
Delivery was fast all 8 seem to well made,1
The bag came torn. I‚Äôve had it for 20 mins. That‚Äôs how long it took to put together. And of course the last bag I hang is torn.,1
Not sure about the weights it can handle and its stability. Folds up nicely.,1
Basic replacement. Construction seems well built and is easy to use. Works almost better then OEM part.,1
product as advertised but the item could be cheaper.,1
So far so good! Still seeing how they will work over a period of time,1
Have some Star Trek gnomes that I purchased locally and they're made of concrete so great for enduring weather. These are very lightweight though so we'll see how it goes. 4 stars cuz they're Star Trek,1
I love this watch band. Bought it for the colors but love the comfort and adjustability. Pleasantly surprised but this. would absolutely purchase again!,1
Love it and it is very expensive. Great gift for a father or grandfather.,1
"cleaned screen on fone then applied new shield with perfect alignment, only had 2 bubbles on right center side.took a while to work them out. then all ok.",1
"It took a little help for my 6 year old to get started, but he was able to complete it on his own. I don't know about replay value, but I 30 minutes to put together another 30 to show everyone his accomplishment. It was worth it.",1
"It came triple wrapped in bubble wrap, outside and inside the box. There was one broken one, but a few drops of alcohol fixed that. Shipping was on time. I'll update once I've worn them.",1
"I had a set like this before until I broke one , so I ordered an extra one . They are exactly as advertised , not to small and not to big and easy to use",1
"Very cute, nice quality",1
Wish there was more pressure. But that may be on my end.,1
It was cute while it lasted!!! My issue was the cap size.,1
"Love, suspense, sacrifice, this book has it all!",1
Two straps fasten the product securely. Very comfortable.,1
This vest is pretty cool. It's made in China so it has really crazy tags with weird English that makes no sense. But it's pretty cool and made out of stretchy Jean material. So it feels very movable. I got the biggest size because I'm a bigger person and usually wear extra large t-shirts. The vest fits tight I think you could be maybe a tiny bit bigger but it really doesn't matter and it looks great. I like the American flags inside even though it was made in China LOL,1
Disappointed in size. We have some other of these type of ashtrays and they are taller.,1
So much going on and so many things you need to know! This series just sucks you in.,1
"Vengeance Be Mine by Louisa Lo is book one in the author‚Äôs Vengeance Demons series. I enjoy a good paranormal romance; however, this book would more accurately fall into the urban fantasy genre. Though this story is light on romance, it was a fun and interesting read. Megan‚Äôs hybrid personality, due to being half demon and half trickster, makes for an entertaining story, with a few twists and turns. If you are a fan of witty NA urban fantasy, check out the first in this series. Dee Words that Sparkle",1
The design and workmanship are very good. It is my gift for my granddaughter.,1
"Very durable. Key and transponder fit perfectly. Has a nice dent near the top where your thumb comfortably fits when you turn the key. Only thing that prevents a 5-star review is the area around the panic button. On the factory key shell, the panic button sits in the plastic so you don't accidentally press it. On this shell, the panic button sits out further than any other button. I've twice pressed the panic button while the keys were in my pocket. Not the end of the world, but something to be aware of.",1
It can be used on your bike or it makes a good phone holder when you are recording.,1
Very pretty and well made. It was just a little larger around than I wanted. I kept it anyway because it did serve the purpose.,1
"The markers themselves are quite nice, but the cap on the brush end has a design flaw. Beware that if you don't exercise extreme caution when putting the cap on the brush end you will end up with a mutilated tip that kind of defeats the joy of having the nice pointy brush tip. Other than that all were nice and juicy and none dried out.",1
My stepson loves for our trip!,1
Bought this for my wife. Went on her series 3 42mm just fine. Fits her wrist great. I guess time will tell.,1
"Easy to assemble and install. Works great. No complaints, I even ordered another one.",1
Good quality and awesome for stoppage drills,1
"While I completely love this product! They sent me one that was 8 months out of date. Usually I do not care about this as silly as that sounds. But we don't for things package such as these are. This you could tell was older.. tasted funny, looks funny, and upset my tummy.. so that's not good.. i really wish Amazon would check the dates on the food more.. anyways..",1
"I've been using it for 5-6 days. Product is okey, well made and working good. You can use multiple devices. I saw only one problem, if you connect two devices same time and after connect to computer or smartphone, the computer or phone don't recognise the cards or memory sticks. First, I connect the reader to the computer or phone then, plug first card or stick, when show the monitor it after plug second memory card/stick, everything ok. Very fast, light. I recommend.",1
"I liked the color and idea of a tube but when I received it, it was heavier and a little larger than expected. I returned it because I did not feel it was going to work well for my travel plans.",1
"Breaking the Law is another sizzling story in the Sugar County Boys series. Taylor is a cheeky young FBI agent who has her eyes set on the ultimate bad boy named Lawson. He's almost twice her age and has ties with criminals. These two have a little sexy history. They are both attracted to each other but find themselves on different sides of the law. What happens when Taylor gets caught by the man who makes her panties melt? This story was hot, steamy, taboo and intriguing. Madison Faye once again gives us another red hot read. Sugar County Boys series is a must read for naughty romance lovers.",1
This is a really nice flat iron. I did a lot of research before buying. I was impressed how quickly the seller sent it out and how fast I received it. Would recommend this product.,1
"I have flat feet and developed planter fasciitis, it works very well and unlike other reviewers, it does not slip around for me may be cz I'm flat footed? I dont take them off to reuse them in other shoes but I will buy more to put in my other flats n heels. I didnt give 5 stars cz I wish they were a little higher, just half an inch or quarter inch higher would be great.",1
"The size is perfect and matches one I purchased for the larger double sink many years ago. Mat was somewhat thinner than the larger sink mat, but is working well.",1
"Very good case. After a year its still standing through numerous drops and falls. The card slots have worn out and there's holes. Some of the outside leather is peeling now.. but again, this after a full year! I will be buying again.",1
Only one of these arrived fine while the other was shattered. I could hear it when I picked up the box all the broken glass and the arrows indicating which direction to up up was on its side. One of these were fine and is working as expected.,1
They were quick to deliver and I wanted the mag base to hold a camera watching machinist level while i worked on the underside of the machine so as not to have to get up and down so much Excellent for my use didn't need the indicator but it will come in handy.,1
"Folio is slim and sturdy. I was looking for something similar to my M-Edge for my Kindle 8 but they don't make anything in the right size. I liked my M-Edge, especially for the flexibility in propping (had a ridge instead of a tab) but like that this is slimmer and vegan. Time will tell if this lasts.",1
"These glasses are made well, and are durable for motorcycle rides. The only issue I have is that the lenses don't get as dark as I'd prefer. They get as dark as the middle shade in the picture of the sunglasses. I have not seen them get as dark as the top pair of sunglasses in the picture. It is super convenient to not have to take them off/ change to a different pair of shades when it becomes night.",1
"Some of it's a little coarse, some small stick bits in it. Cat enjoys it.",1
My wife was very happy with them.,1
Not bad 4yr old son likes it... not very high quality!,1
"I love the lamp style, but however the bulb that came with it arrived broken, please send a replacement. Thank you",1
I mostly wanted for closing the gap under my door. Works well what what I got it for,1
"After a lifetime of using plastic toothbrushes, it's very weird putting a piece of wood into my mouth. They get the job done, but they're gonna take some getting used to.",1
I bought 3 total and when I got the 3rd one opened and started to use it it does not suction to the surfaces. Can I return it? I have since washed it and do not have the box anymore.,1
Fine for lunches. Son enjoys them,1
"This rebounder product will keep you from chasing balls. It is made of good quality plastic and comes with extra elastic bands in case one breaks (which has not happened to me). Simply fill the base with water or sand, throw the ball up, and hit it. Good product for the price.",1
i wouldn't say it's comfortable but compared to some of these body shapers it was much better.,1
This item is not very strong. Looks very fake.,1
"Protect your phone from dust, scratches and any impact with this case. Made from soft rubber TPU bumper and hard material back makes this case capable of protecting the phone on a daily basis. The rubber itself is transparent yet it has full and colorful sparkle bling glitter style design that makes it look more attractive. It is easy to insert and remove the phone from this case, and with its precise cutout design, you‚Äôll have no trouble accessing the port and buttons on the phone. The package also includes a full coverage tempered glass screen protector that you will appreciate. I highly recommend this case, as it is a high-quality product and hard to beat especially at this price point.",1
"I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure. All in all, these are VERY minor complaints, compared to everything this device does so well. I highly recommend!",1
"The speaker has worked out so far. I have not had any problems with the bracket and it holds the speakers over rough trail (no jumps or anything). As others pointed out, I wish the sound came out of her front of the speaker instead of the side but the sound is okay. It has also withstood a couple of storms. I have mine mounted on my bars facing slightly rearward with the buttons facing the front. I then connected the remote to the neck to control the speaker, answer calls and keep the amazingly loud horn scaring the bejeezus out of everyone with just the remote.",1
"Overall this is seems to be working well. The motion detection is a little spotty, but it is easy to move to different spots around the yard. So far there has been a lot less squirrels in my garden.",1
Seems to be working as described. Little heavy/awkward for wife using one handed,1
Fun bows for toddlers. Super cute piggy bows,1
Product seems okay. Made from flexible rubberized plastic so hopefully it will withstand my 2 year old. Only issue is I ordered the Lava Red and they look mostly yellow with a slight red tint.,1
My Bourbon drinks taste better with my new Ice Cubes,1
Fits as expected but there was elastic showing in some areas so I‚Äôm curious about the longevity.,1
I ALSO BOUGHT THE REQUIRED CABLE. I DID BUILD MY OWN MOUNTING POLE IT WORKS GREAT,1
Good book without a physical course,1
Very light weight. But slides out very easily. No complaints for the money spent.,1
Plush well done but a little too small,1
"Like it alot, however I should of read dimensions better it is small than what it appears on site.",1
"Good metal-sturdy-small, just what I needed!",1
a little to bloody for me. ok story.,1
"I ordered this to repaint some cabinet doors. They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.",1
"I needed something to bring with me to the restaurant with a child I babysit. I wanted something that would be easy to transport and quick to pick up before eating. I also wanted more than just a few pieces to build with. For the price of these and the amount I was not sure if it was going to be as great quality i received! It was a great surprise to me of how nice they are. There is 21 triangles and 21 squares, totalling 42 pieces. The edges are smooth, nothing jagged on them. The colors are bright and the magnets are strong enough to hold the constructed together well. Great purchase for sure.",1
"Get the disk or wait for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video is the worst.",1
My dog has no patience.,1
These are really cute scrunchies. Purchased them for my daughter and they are pretty soft. They come in 2 different textures/fabrics. For the amount that you get it's worth the money. All the different colors go with any outfit. Super cute.,1
"Mouth and teeth feel really good and clean after using. Charged battery lasts a long time and the flosser is easy to store and travel with. It does leak a little though while using and a little difficult to grasp without slipping or accidentally turning off, but I should get use to holding it properly.",1
"These are okay..but once you use them you can't touch the area you colored or it will get messy, overall not bad but I prefer something that won't smear if you touch over it later on. Thank you.",1
Love the idea of this powder to carry in my purse because my compact pressed powders always crack. So far I really like it but I feel the powder does not come out good enough. I bang it on the table to try to prime the powder on the brush but it comes out so sparingly. I‚Äôm in South Florida and need a lot of powder on my face. Maybe I‚Äôm not doing it right but I continue to use it and like it. I have a powder sunscreen in the same type of applicator and it comes out generously.,1
I love how this fits and very easy to just wash and wear. The price is great too,1
"Love this detergent. Annoyed that the delivery driver must have been rough with it cause one spilled out, wasting it.",1
"I really dig the look of this hoodie but the only thing I would change is the back. It falls lower than the front which I don't like as much, but I still wear this quite often and it can easily be over looked. I'm pretty picky though. The thumb holes and the size of the collar are great in cold weather because they act as built in gloves and a scarf which is cozy. I like the style of this hoodie and the brand.",1
Item was as described. Shipment was prompt and well-packaged. Good seller.,1
"I work in a warehouse and sometimes I have to move packages. The watch does not get caught on things or rub up against things, mainly because it is such a slim watch. Good buy",1
"This was a readable book, and enjoyable enough, but not exactly a tell-all. Divided into sections, the first tells of her years of interaction with Trump on the Apprentice. The second section is a quick glossing over of the campaign, not really revealing anything new, but explaining how and why she came to work on the campaign. Finally, she relates another glossing-over of her White House days; again not revealing many previously unreported details. She does have a rather unique perspective as she has known Trump for quite awhile and has been able to observe the mental deterioration during those years.",1
Set it and forget it. Only wish it could charge quicker.,1
"Great camera, not the purest color and not the greatest resolution, but acceptable performance.",1
Really good dog house. Doesn't leak. For a 5 star rating it would need better anchors to the ground. Over all quite happy with my purchase. I would buy it again.,1
Great to read this book . I though it was good to have great ending too. I love read your books..,1
"I was very skeptical with this purchase and after spending the amount, was nervous I‚Äôd regret it. However, I‚Äôm impressed so far. I‚Äôve only used it twice but so far so good. I was looking for something that wouldn‚Äôt be extremely expensive, would be reliable and small enough to fit in my apartment. I took several pictures to give a good idea for anyone unsure about how it would turn out. Fair warning, the box is pretty heavy when delivered which should be expected. It took about 15-20 minutes to assemble with two of us. It‚Äôs perfect if you‚Äôre looking for a basic, simple treadmill. Only con I have so far is the incline, which is kind of nonexistent but otherwise I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase and happy with the price.",1
"This tent packs up super small, and so lightweight. I bought this for our family of three. I will say, i was a little intimidated by packing/folding this thing up, but after watching the YouTube video, it was a piece of cake! *Do yourself a giant favor and watch the YouTube video!*",1
"So convenient, every thing good, just the base part was too heavy, less 1/3 would be good enough.",1
"just a couple of comments here on an inexpensive and useful device: in case you wonder, this device plugs into a three-prong outlet, just like the plug it accepts from the controlled device. I wondered if I needed to connect it like a new outlet, or plug it into an outlet - now I know and so do you. Also, the time-adjustment knobs are not too well calibrated perhaps - well the off time seems about right, but the on time is spectacularly off: when I set it for one minute it stayed on for over eight minutes. But when I tweaked it down to thirty seconds, it stayed on for 90 seconds. Not linear, so you may have to fiddle with it to get the desired operation. Mine runs a 1/4 horsepower water pump.",1
Great addition to my decks!,1
nice glove u may have to remove the air vent from the picky,1
"Love the color! Love the Thickness! It‚Äôs going to be great for the frigid Northern VA winters. The only disappointment I have is the puff comes off too easily. The snap is not constructed very well making the puff fall off at the simplest movement of your head. I purchased the hat for the flexibility of wearing it with or without the puff. Unless this is just a defect in this cap, you really only have the option of wearing the cap without the puff.",1
"I bought this set to replace with my current old broom. The new one actually did the clean job, easy to swipe the dust to the pan, even some bread crumbs. The dustpan itself are foldable, no extra space required for store.",1
"TURN DOWN THE BEEP, I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE BEEP! Otherwise it's a neat speaker and the most stable at loud volumes without static or popping. Bass is solid. Would buy again if you Fix the BEEP! Wakes up the entire house at night, my neighbor can hear it!",1
Works perfect for the area I needed at..,1
Very comfortable perfect to correct the posture you can use hours without any problem my children like. because it gives them a better posture when sitting in front of the desk.,1
I think that the book was very well written with interesting twists and turns. I would recommend it and enjoyed reading it.,1
"Would so love to give this 5 stars, but the clock does not work. Not done trying to fix it yet. Hate to send it back. It was so well packaged, and otherwise is in perfect condition.",1
I purchased these coffee mugs because of the Swell reputation. The length of time that it keeps a product cold or hot is spot on from the advertisement. The one thing I do not like about either of these coffee travelers that I purchased is the drink spout. You flip it up to drink out of it but the part that you flip up is moist from either cold or hot drink whatever is in it. That part is in the way of your drinking and usually will get your face nose or whatever is near it wet. I have to constantly dry that flip part off before I drink my beverage. That‚Äôs why I gave it four stars.,1
These are really convenient travel bags. I like the various sizes. I used to use a large toiletry bag which took up a lot of space. These bags carry the same amount of stuff but can be dispersed throughout your suit case. They're pretty durable and work for toiletries.,1
"Bought it as a gift for my friend‚Äôs kid, who seemed amazed and happy at the design that was different from many of his other spiderman toy figurines.",1
They came packaged well and in perfect condition. All 3 work as described. I love the fact that my devices don't come unplugged. My only problem with them is that in a couple of my devices they do not plug in fully. (See attached photos),1
"This leash didn't really help with the pulling of my dog, it just confused him during his walk. But it is super soft which makes it comfortable for him but the clips are super sturdy and lock! My dog was quite the escape artist in his last hardness, it would unlock if i wasn't paying attention and he took off too fast but in this I have no fear of him getting loose.",1
"This is actually my first keyboard cover I've purchased so I don't have anything else to compare it to. But overall, it serves its function. One of my friends purchased one similar on Amazon but different company, and her's is much thicker and can't see back light on keyboard. The one I purchased is thin, which I like because I can still see keyboard light. The cover is nice and smooth, fits on keyboards correctly, and doesn't move around. Stays in place. The only reason I rated it a 4 out of 5, because little pieces of lint (i.e from either clothing, and my dog's hair), grips on the keyboard. It's not a deal breaker for me, but I just notice it because I use my computer for work everyday.",1
"The product here worked as a video cord and it did provide video to the TV. The problem I ran into was that I still got the same, poor display of video, but I think it's because the new TCL Roku TV, doesn't like older systems. Even my plug and play joysticks that I have don't show up as well on the Roku TV. The Atari Flashback works perfectly fine however on the Roku TV. Final Thoughts: I'll need to try and find a small, 15 or 19"" tube TV if I want to play my 93 Atari cartridges on an actual Atari console.",1
Great bike but the wheels are plastic. It works fine with my 4 yrs old son.,1
"It works as expected. It cools my room (250 sq ft) effectively. However, it is very noisy (as expected). The draining location is very low (very close to the ground). It will need some boosting before I can drain it. The assembly is relatively ease. The product works good but the delivery is poor (zero star). When I received this unit, I noticed there was only 1 strap on the unit and it was kind of loose. When I try to move the box, the bottom of the box fell off. When I opened the box, one of the windows slide was broken, I found that small piece on my driveway!! It is very obvious to me the deliver was not up to any standard. The unit seems to be working fine regardless.",1
The planner is great but it would be perfect if it came with a book band.,1
"Beautiful bright and vivid color combo of red and yellow flowers for the Monarchs. Did awesome in the ground outside in warmer weather. Brought inside for winter however and did really good for most of the winter and spring, but died on me about a month ago. Will get another one.",1
"love these pants, I will be buying more colors! I am glad I read the reviews because I was sized at a large but ordered a medium and they fit perfectly. I took them out of the bag and they looked very tiny, almost scary tiny that the waist wouldnt even fit over my thighs, but they did and they fit great as they are so stretchy!",1
"These puppets are absolutely darling. I would have given them a five star, but wanted to comment on that the finger holders themselves could have been longer. A few of them want to fall off my finger. I know that my adult kids will have fun with these making up stories for my six month old granddaughter.",1
Good quality. Can cover more than two cards. Meet expectation.,1
"It tears off your hair and it hurts, but you can see nasty stuff on the mask after. Make sure to moisturize before you put on and after because it does dry your skin out, and make sure to have something to close your pores because you‚Äôll break out if you don‚Äôt",1
"I looked at all the gloves and chose this one for price and quantity, its great to have two",1
A nice size bag to pack in luggage for trip to Europe. Will use as carry-on for return trip.,1
"This is a hot, quick read. There are some errors in the very beginning and I was just about to stop reading but it got better and I am happy I did finish it. This is not a book you will get all involved with. Everything is wrapped up nicely and very quickly.",1
This thing is great. It would get a 5* if I didn't need to keep around a USB mini to recharge it. USB micro or USB C would make this product amazing! It fits well in a pocket and keeps a charge.,1
"I bought this, not for a baby but because I'm a nurse and I'm always looking for a good, dependable bag for all my stuff. This bag did not disappoint!",1
This tissue paper is so soft and durable.,1
"This is a great item to bring when you travel. We travel on motorcycles and this is very small and easy to pack. Many hotels still do not have USB ports, so this comes in handy, just plug in the power strip and plug in your USB cords. The one minor issue is the electric plugs on the power strip are for european plugs. Good if you are traveling internationally, but would like to see one with US plugs for extra power when we travel too.",1
I can walk normally on icy sidewalks and streets. They fit over my boots easily and stay put. I took one star off because they look a bit flimsy and I don‚Äôt know how long they‚Äôll last,1
I like the scent. It's very pleasant scent.,1
"I would give it 5 stars, except the traffic updates require a subscription service, contrary to what I was led to believe in the product description.",1
"I wish they cost less than they do (and my switch to Square as POS has resulted in the printing of MUCH more paper!!), but these guys provide the best price going for this size paper. Always arrives on time and it's what we need.",1
My daughter went crazy for it,1
"The quality of these earrings is nothing special, but my daughter wore them to the prom and they looked beautiful with her gown. Very stylish.",1
Chemical reaction is spot on but the applicator is cardboard so wear gloves as it tends to leak into the cardboard before it reaches the end of the swab.,1
"This phone case is as pictured - it's adorable! however, it doesn't fit my phone snuggly - my phone tends to fall out of the case. It's also difficult to take pictures with flash with the case on, as the flash reflects against the case. It's still cute, though, and I'd recommend it - just some issues to be aware of.",1
This is a really cute romper and I actually saw someone wearing it on vacation. However the one I ordered was too small for me. I also like coverage around my armpit fat and this didn‚Äôt cover so I returned.,1
This product is very pretty and I love the special clasps that make it easy to install on jewelry. However the magnets tend to come loose and have to be re glued and it is quite heavy so it tends to slip forward on your neck.,1
An excellent and concise introduction to basic guitar playing. this book is very well and it contains a lot of new and effective steps and information about guitar lessons..,1
"Very nice butter dish. A little wider and taller than I was expecting, but it will do fine.",1
These sheets are very soft and are made of good-quality fabric. They fit snugly to the mattress and the pillow cases are long enough to cover the pillows completely. Very happy with the purchase.,1
"Nice shorts they did come with a tiny tiny hole maybe about a cm big, but its so minor i didn't bother returning them",1
This pool fountain worked great in our pool. A little playing with the various inlet restrictors gave us just the effect we wanted. It is worth the price.,1
"I thought they were solid but they were not, and I see it is in the description so my bad, product was as represented",1
"comprehensive reading. learn all about carbs, sugars and why they are not good for you, especially cancer patients.",1
Fun to choose the ring you want but any power outage resets to original and have to go through to find yours again. Don‚Äôt put it behind anything or it won‚Äôt work. Bummer as we have a century old home with lots of walls & turns,1
I really liked these they are really comfortable they did come with a strong chemical smell so please make sure to wash before wearing,1
It fits nice looks great,1
Takes some getting use to,1
"Easy to set up, works perfect with my Xbox 360!",1
Item is ok. It makes a sound like a rough metal to plastic contact compare to other massagers that are much quieter. Only a few hrs of use since. Ought... Not sure if it will last long,1
"Used to penetrate 1/2"" drywall with ducting either side. Had to glue in place before attaching ducting. Light duty.",1
"Fantastic product. We used it for the first time on a trip from Omaha, NE to Charleston, SC and held up great. The only issue we ran into was when it rained the last night of the trip (when we were parked at a hotel) and the straps allowed water to drip, and pool, inside the car. When we were driving, the rain was not an issue, but when parked, the straps leaked...a lot. Still, I would very much recommend this product and I'm glad we purchased it.",1
"So far, after 7 days of use, I am impressed with this book. The content is well paced and organized. It is well outlined from.the basics to harder subjects. Hopefully I will.pass this exam.",1
"Not sure if I have a small head or what but it falls over my face at night. Feels nice, though. Does not keep my hair from getting all crazy so I quit using it.",1
This knife is amazing,1
charges in significantly less time than my black & decker batts,1
"I've only been taking these for a few days. Honestly, it's too early to tell if they're doing anything BUT I just have to say I have been breaking my fast with a small scoop of peanut butter and two of these gummies. LOL, they're delicious with peanut butter!",1
Product was easy to install and has been working to my expectations,1
Used it as personal item to carry on plane in addition to my carry-on. It held my camera and extra lens besides some food and some other items. The strap that crossed my body made it feel safer from someone stealing it in tourist areas.,1
Material not good quality. I have washed two times and it has shrunk.,1
"This is an ok clock. The dim is either bright or off, there isn't really an in between setting. It's fine for the price and I like the size.",1
Hard to put together. But other than that it's nice.,1
Attractive small and not thick and love the rfid safety feature,1
"The set is cute. My daughter 6 yr old wore it for school and looked so cute. It‚Äôs a good deal for all 4 pieces at that price but the quality of the skirt of is very cheap. The skirt is like felt material rather than a better quality. For the price an and being that you get the whole set, purpose was served.",1
"be careful with the top front. once it is folded, the dent won't come out",1
Socks feel great! Good work socks and very comfortable,1
Love how it looks. I am usually a M and order a L fits loose enough to wear with jeans or skirts.,1
"My son enjoys it. But at least on the Fire 10, if you have a touch engaged, the next touch doesn't register. This is frustrating for my son because sometimes when he holds the tablet his little fingers curl around and touch the screen and then his normal touches don't register. Also he is young so likes to just palm all the bubbles two at a time...which doesn't register.",1
"These run small, I'd say at least one size too small. Otherwise the fabric is sturdy and nice for the price.",1
My 6 month old loves these. Started with mesh feeder and way to hard to clean so purchased silicone feeder and love it some much better. I am glad that there are multiply sizes as baby grows my son uses the med. size one right now. Great product would definitely buy again.,1
"Very bright, long distance beam. Not the best design connecting handle to main body. Very top heavy and feels like it may eventually break. Thus far it works great.",1
"Great case, kept most of the drops from cracking my phone (the protective glass screen now has a crack from dropping it, but my phone itself has still been pretty well protected). If you‚Äôre a fidgeter like me, the sliding compartment on the back does not stay closed very well after some usage. I had to superglue mine shut, but that was more my own fault than the case‚Äôs.",1
"These are pretty great replacements for traditional laces, however, the components are a big large and out dated. The spring button to loosen the laces is pretty bulky. Otherwise they are pretty awesome for the price.",1
this is piece of junk and they demanding $9 to return it....,1
"It is a nice waste basket, but it is a little small. I love the brushed nickel. It is very rich looking and matches the other bathroom accessories.",1
Wish they came with a paper tube in the middle rather than the thin stick for tapping down the insides. Love the tube.,1
"Installing this in my boat, for the price to have bt can‚Äôt beat it",1
"When I first brought this thing out of the box I was pissed, because it looks more like a toy than an effective piece of equipment...but don't let the look fool you. This thing is pretty hard core it's at least as bright as any other spot that I've owned, the flashlight option is also bright , and it takes and holds a charge for a long time.",1
"Great, but knocked off a star because it needs locking wheels. I bought it for a printer and when the printer is actually printing documents the cart rolls around my wooden office floor.",1
Pretty simple design and fairly easy to put together. I like how it gets the weights up off the floor- only wish is that it would hold a couple more sets.,1
Easy to use and be able to scare animal away. Solar light made it perfect! Size is just right that is not too big. Variety choice of frequency makes it more effectively rebel animals,1
"I love the deep red of this purse and I loveeee that it has many card slots and can hold my phone. Love the material as well. Only downfall is that the coin zipper is positioned so awkwardly. It should be at the top instead of the bottom, but I can work with it.",1
I am satisfied with this product. It holds my phone perfect angle for watching the video. This is a very good looking prodcut and work as advertised,1
was little tough getting some screws tight and the leg rest needs to be a bit stronger .Would buy again as it is pretty comfortable,1
"This is a great Amazon product. I haven't found anything that I don't use it for. I use it to cook, to work out, to look up information and many more things. The weather is one of the things I use everyday on the Show along with the alarm feature. This is a must have item!!!!",1
"We were told by the local Cable Company to purchase this brand and model of a router and after hours which turned into days of trying to figure out how to configure it with the Cable Company were told that since we didn't buy it from them they couldn't help us. Not Motorola's fault, but VERY frustrating. Went to return and realized we are 2 days over the return date and now we can't return it. :0( Argh",1
"The product did not ship with a cool pack, but arrived in good shape anyway. I counted the candy and was disappointed to find that one bag of peanut M&M's was missing and substituted with an extra bag of Skittles. I never intended to eat the Skittles, so it looks like my coworkers will be getting an extra bag of candy. All in all, I thought it would be cheaper than buying the candy bars individually, but after giving away the Skittles, it actually isn't much of a savings, so I won't be buying this package again.",1
The flavor is delicious! It is a lil SPICY. and there is no directions in english on how to make but the picture directions is pretty obvious. I wouldn't buy this one again but I would buy black bean noodles fresh!!!,1
Nice it was a gift to a friend they liked it,1
Wonderful and stylish. Protects my laptop during the commute. If you need to take alot of things along with you this may not be for you. I am a minimalist when it comes to what I have to lug around so this case serves its purpose beautifully,1
Used it for a Christmas dinner as a maternity dress it complemented me very well fit as expected I prop could of went a size down. Overall happy with the purchase,1
Its smaller than what I expected but gives a decent amount of perfectly cooked rice (perfect for 1 or 2 persons). Its easy to clean and takes up very little space. Good product for low price. Highly recommended!,1
"Bought it for my mother, as she asked for my old one. They are LARGER then I remember. The cord is flat and wider than normal, and should last longer.",1
Like the fit of these. They are cut lower under your belly so they can still fit as you get bigger.,1
A lil too brief but I still liked it,1
"When you are used to a keyboard, it seems small. Just will take some getting used to using. Able to see the whole screen hole you type! Awesome!",1
"I love the ingredients, the aroma and the way my feet feel in the morning after using the balm. However, I took one star off because it‚Äôs a little greasy. It‚Äôs too hot to wear socks in bed but you don‚Äôt n Ed a lot of product.",1
Very nice. Well made. Too is a bit smaller than the bottom.,1
"Works great, and is good looking. My son complains that it rubs on the back of his neck though.",1
Not a ton of bass but sounds super clear. I would definitely buy again.,1
"After calibrating this extended battery via full 2 cycle discharge and charge I can confidently say it was a great buy. This has fixed one of the few flaws in my v20, now I can comfortably go 2 full days without charging with moderate use with almost 7 hours screen time, while still maintaining fast charging. There are some minor short comings. The case does not offer much in protection as others have mentioned, the bump surrounding the screen is quite small. Also the screen protector will protect at minor scratches at best but not from drop damage as its not a full glass version. The front camera is also exposed. There is the issue with having to remove the case to fully insert the charger. So I'm taking off a star for that. Still highly recommended would buy again.",1
Got to have the right kind of grease gun.,1
Nice quality and fit as expected.,1
"The warmer works really well. The wax heated quickly. Wish it came with instructions on how to use the wax, not just how to turn on the warmer. I wasn't sure if I needed cloth strips to remove the wax or if I just pull it off. I figured out to just pull the wax off based on the pictures on Amazon. I think the wax worked effectively for my eye brows, but not so great on shorter coarse hairs.",1
Easy to use and carry. I would like a buffer openings for ice,1
Glad they had a little bit of a flicker.,1
Very pretty necklace. My daughter loved it. Only negative is that I thought it was a flat necklace. But it is more bowl shaped so it sits funny.,1
"This is a sturdy stand for my Iphone X. The four pads attached to the stand provides stability and protection for my device. The viewing angle for Iphone X is excellent when placed horizontally or vertically. I ordered the red stand and it looks great, however, the finish was not perfect. The bottom peg was not fully coated. Overall, a good product at an affordable price.",1
Might have to wash a few times,1
Decent pastel pencils for the price. Not super soft but I did not expect they would be. The only disappointment is that the beige pencil must have a hunk of a darker color in the lead. All three of the beige swatches I did have a dark streak in them. So the beige won't be useful. Too bad since it would have been nice on darker papers.,1
Fun cover! Enjoying the new technology. Very satisfied.,1
"My dog really likes it. I got her a MEDIUM because I wanted to save a little money and it works fine for her ,she's a pit bull mix and 45 pounds . It did take her a while for her to realize she can lie on it ,but once she did she wouldn't leave it. Now let's hope she doesn't rip it to shreds ha",1
"Brightly colored, clean designs, well made. Expect to use them again and again.",1
"Small issue, addressed quickly",1
"I bought/wear this only as a slip, it is very see through other wise. Its been great for the slip function, but it is certainly no spanx either. I hate feeling squeezed in with spanx so it makes me happy, just don't expect spanx control from this product. I like the smoothness of the material, but it does grab fabrics. If it gives me too much trouble, I rub it with a dryer sheet and it helps counter the cling (and smells great, ha!). That said I do have a pet peeve for clothes I have to make adjustments to wear (ie rubbing down with a dryer sheet), so its not as grab and go I as would like it to be.",1
"The car is awesome, but the packaging for mailing was not so great. The car broke loose in the box, if it wasn't loose already and the driver's side mirror was broken off. Very disappointed since I paid $25 for it.",1
We have had them for 2 days and have not even washed them yet! Bought them for our camping trailer and will use them soon.,1
It took me quite a while to finish this book but so glad to have wadded through to the end. A must read for all. But way thick in the weeds.,1
"The ultimate solution for running, training with gears on. Just brilliant i was looking for something like this for years. Thanks",1
"I read others reviews before posting and decided to take my chances. I was pleasantly surprised! The candies were misshapen and had to get out of the wrappers, but since they‚Äôre just for me, I don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôre not stale and chewy; they seem to be fresh minus the obvious one time melt they must have gone through. You get about a ziplock sandwich bag size full of jolly ranchers.",1
Great price - delivery was so slow that I forgot I ordered them so it was a nice surprise to see them sitting on my porch.,1
"We needed a small dresser for a shared bedroom in a camper and this was perfect. Fit perfectly into the space that we needed and looks nice as well. It's not the highest quality piece, but it's sturdy enough for what we need it for and the drawers offer enough room for my daughters items.",1
"If I take the time to write a review, then you should pay for my prime membership.",1
"I liked the style of these from the pictures because they looked a little more business professional compared to what I already own. Once I got them I didn't really like how they look on my face, but they work and the polarized lenses are decent. I look like a blind person wearing them but everyone needs a pair of throw-around glasses so these are it for me.",1
"These are my first bluetooth headphones. My previous wired headphones all got retired due to the wear and tear for the wires. I feel this bluetooth headphones are more convenient than the wired headphones. The voice quality is excellent for both inbound and outbound, no difference from any wired headphones. With the much shorter wires, I foresee I could use them longer than my previous headphones.",1
It does help that is for sure,1
"This was a very enjoyable read for me as a kid growing up watching the classics. Although there were some parts of the movie i didn't enjoy, my overall opinion of this movie is still high.",1
"Does not wick well, but it helps my thigh strain. would buy again.",1
"The hair is beautiful, my birthday present to myself",1
I like them a lot the only thing is I have small hands so some of the fingers are a little big,1
"It's what I expected, lots of practice drills. For a beginner, some of the drills are more than I can handle now but it helps me to have a more focused practice session.",1
These are amazing and I love them. They are great for transferring shampoo from one container to another.,1
Does not track blood pressure,1
Lots of information that you can pull with this reader. Pretty happy with it,1
Plays really good Thanks ‚ò∫,1
My gf loved them while I gifted yes her first set of dice. Affordable and a great look.,1
They work great. No way to change volume except with a Bluetooth device.,1
great tool but if you are not careful it will bind and jerk . Probably just my inability to keep it level.,1
"I loved the price, for $45 when on sale I was able to get a reliable and easy to use wireless router. I told spectrum to kick rocks. Setup is easy and a person who understands little can do it. I have noticed a significant improvement of coverage and speed throughout my home. My house is 2200 square feet and it works well throughout.",1
These gift boxes were so cute! Very good quality. My only complaint is that it did not come with directions on how to fold them properly. I eventually figured it out but took me a few tries.,1
"It works well without any setup, just plug and play. The only thing I don't like, at least with my laptop, is that it makes the laptop screen black when I cast to the tv. I can still use the touchpad or even the touch screen on my laptop, but can only see the screen on the tv. I'm not sure if this is a setting that can be changed on my laptop, but when I used to cast from my laptop to a roku, I was able to see the screen on both the laptop and tv.",1
Pay attention to the narrator at the beginning of the film. She says some disturbing things. It was pretty impactful for me. A little scary. This is a good movie. Watch it. It's very different,1
"I Really like it, but it‚Äôs not quite a love story; it‚Äôs very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don‚Äôt ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I‚Äôve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating. So the fact I don‚Äôt have to wind and wrap and wind and wrap, I‚Äôll give it a star back, for the convenience it provides. Overall though, the pros far outweigh the cons.",1
"After a few weeks, the right side stopped working on the first pair I purchased. Anker's customer support is very good though, replacement was sent to me quickly and haven't had any issues with the 2nd pair. I like that it comes with 4 different sizes of the piece that goes in your ear, and the part that you plug in is slightly less bulky than other similar headphones I've tried. They stay pretty comfortable even when wearing them for long periods of time, and the sound quality is as good as I'd expect for a $40 pair. I'll give this 5 stars if this second pair is still working in 6 months with no problems.",1
Very soft & easy to use. My belly isn't very large yet & this sits more on the lower stomach than under it. I think this product would be best when you're further along & your stomach is larger.,1
"Bought 3 items 2 for Christmas gift, my wife loves hers.",1
There really nice looking in my cartilage piercing. The only complaint I have about them is the diamonds really hard to screw in with big fingers.,1
"Got computer today. i7, 32g ram 1t ssd... Very nice. Very fast. It feels solid though maybe a bit heavier than I thought it would be. Powered up and connected to internet quickly. Installed chrome browser and chrome would hang after a reboot until I guess McAfee did it's scanning... Uninstalled McAfee and then that went away. Other than that this is a great machine... I will revise this review after I get a bit more time with it!",1
This battery was for a cordless phone we have had for years. It fit and worked perfectly.,1
These are smaller than i expected.,1
O have not been able to switch from Fahrenheit to Celsius yet. I would appreciate more details on how to do it.,1
"My friend just got s9 and what could be the better gift than this? The case was good leather touch and feel to it. Comes with a wristlet and credit card slots and 1 ID slot. I put on her phone which was easy to do so without any hassle. It also has a good value to it, my friend liked it.",1
"I got tired of my favorite shaving soap being out of stock and decided to make my own. I originally tried the clear soap like this from the same manufacturer and added my own raw shea butter, but it came out to waxy. The amount of shea butter in this is perfect. I add in tea tree oil and melt it in the microwave in my shave soap container. Works as well as the name brand stuff I use to buy, but at a fraction of the price. Just make sure you have a good badger hair brush to use with this. If you don't have a shaving soap container, you can use a small tupperware container with a lid. I use a Proraso shaving soap container from a previous purchase. It's all plastic and works great.",1
Arrived on time and in perfect condition! Very PRETTY!,1
"I really like that fact that these are semi-insulated pull on shoe/boots. I've worn them out in the snow a few times and they seem to be reasonably waterproof as well. Easy to get on and off. The only ""negative"" was the insoles and the absence of any arch or even cushion. But based on the wonderful value, I picked up a pair of gel insoles for under $9 and now these boots are quite comfortable to wear and serve a great purpose.",1
only thing I dont like is it makes a small noise when in use. otherwise its all good.,1
I got the glitter mermaid cake topper for my daughters birthday next month. The colors are bright and beautiful and there is just the right amount of glitter. It does seem a little high for the materials used but worth it if your child loves mermaids as much as mine.,1
"This story is awfully familiar; I may have bought it before, under a different title or author name?' Anyway, it was good. It was short. Nice characters. Not that much emotion but I can make up for that in my mind. I couldn't see any obvious editorial mistakes. The dialogue read as natural, not stilted. It was a good idea having a character who can see real magical creatures under their human disguises and I guess having him shut away in a facility because of it, is a natural story progression. The elf was fun..",1
Easy to use. Saw much inprovement within days!,1
These do a great job of keeping drinks cold. They are attractive and fit nicely in even a smaller hand. The only reason I'm giving them four stars is that they have to be hand washed and I prefer to throw everything in the dishwasher.,1
The sound quality the picture quality very very good. My only comment is that I can't pick up some of my local programming. But that's minor considering the Channel that I do have available on my satellite television.,1
Very good Spades Game,1
"I hurt my calf doing double unders during a workout. I think I may have had a tiny little tear. I bought this brace and wear it every day, regardless of the workout. Two weeks later I am able to do double unders with no pain. I am going to continue to wear this for a few more weeks and then always on days that require jumping. It is flexible, comfortable and adjustable. I have big old fat calf muscles...so I am always worried about things fitting. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is I was hoping it would be ""firmer"" or...more compression.",1
It‚Äôs look very nice but is very clumsy I don‚Äôt know how much protection will give your phone I don‚Äôt think much protection but it looks very good,1
"But a satisfactory imitation. Once we received the missing, and later, replacements for the incorrectly-shipped parts, it was reasonably easy to put together. The screw heads do strip VERY easily, and you would be well-advised discard any that feel like they are starting to strip, because you will not get them secured. Also, be sure you have a short-handled screw driver for assembly.",1
Amazing laptop/pc desk... it is sturdy enough to keep a monitor and a laptop together at a same time.. assembly was relatively easy though it took a while.. material feels quite nice.. overall it is a great desk for student to organize stuff..,1
Liked the snowflake tin,1
My husband and I like the blanket. It is a quality product. We have the full size blanket. I am waking up feeling more rested. I wear an activity tracker and have noticed my restful sleep time has increased since I started using it.,1
"Cameras work very well, but doesn‚Äôt have slot for card so you have to pay for cloud backup. Will replace, but not sellers fault. Will just use them for supplemental coverage",1
Beautiful. Would have given 5 stars if umbrella can be seen on both sides.,1
"I am mostly satisfied. It was easy to assemble and the material is sturdy. I was initially disappointed because the package did not include the promised ribbons and adhesive for the ribbons. However, the seller reached out to me. She was willing to ship the ribbons to me, but I had already come up with a different idea. So she gave me a 25% refund. I would suggest this specific product over others due to its sturdiness and ease of assembly. But my advice is to order 2-3 weeks in advance so that if you need the ribbons and they're missing, you can tell the seller and have enough time for them to get shipped to you.",1
Works very well and bright! The adhesive surface must be stronger!,1
"Love the look and simplicity of use, but my 1 year old has figured out how to pull it out of the outlet.",1
This works very well for the cost and the need. I did not provide 5 stars simply because the tool does get hot within 15 minutes.,1
"Weed eater works great, blower is good, both are light weight. I took off a star because I wish the blower blew a little harder.",1
I am unable to get any TV channels due to some 'location' error!!!,1
It was a pain in the tail to install in my 2013 Dodge Durango R/T but once I got them seated in correctly the light output looked great!,1
"Had a little trouble getting it to work. But, it seems fine now. I guess my grandson just needed to explore with it.",1
Used this in my entryway above the coat rail and over a bench. My boyfriend loves that print so I added it to our home. The narrowness of the print made it perfect for the space.,1
"Gift for my mom. Not packaged terribly well, so the outter cover was a little smooshed upon arrival, but I doubt it will effect the inside calendar.",1
"I ordered my Xbox one X Fallout 76 bundle this past Saturday and it arrived 2 days later. I hooked up the console and so far it has been working like the dream and the graphics are far better than the original console and it is whisper quiet. The seller did an excellent job getting this xbox one bundle out to me quicker than timely. My only complaint was the fact the seal was broken and box was opened, also the controller that came with the xbox one x console was already paired with the Xbox one X which is a little discomforting. However, the console appears to be brand new as well as the controller, the fallout game that came with it is still factory sealed. No signs of this unit being used/refurbished. The console is awesome and I so far am enjoying my purchase. So far so good, the seller is awesome. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the package being opened. Otherwise, 5 stars all the way.",1
The basket fits well in the bottom of my closet and holds the extras that seem to float around. the only reaso I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is I wished it was a little bigger.,1
"I have had this around a year now and it is still working as it should - it lasted outside in Michigan weather, Summer / Winter. Might be the location i put it in but sometimes it doesnt come on as quickly as we would like though.",1
"It‚Äôs a nice squishy and looks like my mom‚Äôs favorite bread so that was a win, but it didn‚Äôt smell like pineapple at all. It had more of a chemical smell to it which isn‚Äôt good. I didn‚Äôt get it for the smell but it is a bit off putting and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll fade in time.",1
It arrived on time and seems to be sturdy,1
"I like that I got a medium and I can make is smaller. I am 5‚Äô4 142 and if one wants it tight, you can...and if you want it with a little more breathing room, it can still be adjusted without the need to go up a size.",1
This was perfect for what I needed it for...deco for our back patio. I like that it‚Äôs made from a hard plastic but that it looks like metal.,1
"The hose is GREAT, BUT, it took 20-30 mins to untangle it.",1
"It was very easy to put on, no problems there. It definitely adds some bulk to the pen itself which takes away from the sleek design and the comfort of holding it. I have found the pen is not as sensitive to the double tap feature with the case on nor does it charge as fast. The other reviews did state that the magnet isn‚Äôt as strong and it‚Äôs true so I wasn‚Äôt surprised. Over all I purchased this to try and preserve and protect my pencil and this does the trick but it does dull it down some.",1
Closure doesnt always work,1
great buy for the money. Wife likes them for short trips out of the house,1
"Cute. Has to be really sunny for it to move, but I like it a lot.",1
helps me to remember to take my vitamins every day. Kind of wish they had an indicator with M T W Th F S Su or something like that instead of numbers.,1
"I ordered these for my husband, to help with knee pain, while working out. They seem to really help provide support that he did not have prior. My only issue was the tend to slide down, so they had to be readjusted just a couple times. Comfortable material, though.",1
I love the product however I just noticed the one strap will not lay correctly because it was stitched wrong so it is twisted,1
"These are good pants for just walking outside or lounging and such. They are not anything special, but they get the job done. The do get a bit more snug after wash/dry.",1
Blade was kind of dull. But otherwise fine.,1
"Didn‚Äôt last long, but wasn‚Äôt really expecting them to.",1
That enough for so much money,1
"Nice clean acceleration. Didn't really get a noticeable boost in mpg, but might be a little better that might one day justify the cost. Doesn't sound like it's straining while at idle any longer.",1
"A bit snug, purchased for Mom who LOVES THEM. need more designs and colours.",1
"Did not seem to work for my 1 month old with gas and tummy aches, however that may just be his development and age and not necessarily colic. I will say that it is a nice quality design and the bag smells great- even if it doesn‚Äôt work for your little one, it‚Äôs a nice little heating pad to have around the house for stiff neck or sore muscles or even sinus headaches.",1
A co-worker suggested I try this product. I was looking for something to have at work. The taste is pretty good. Blending takes some time. At home I put it in the blender. Otherwise you need to have a shaker bottle or stir a long time. For creating ketones and staying in Ketosis it is worth a try.,1
"I like vegetables though I rarely eat them, maybe trying various methods of cooking them not eating just raw will help.",1
"Honestly it was really good, a bit bland however. I had to add a bit more seasoning to bring out some of the flavour but other than that not bad at all.",1
I needed last minute stockings and mantel holders. Both worked out great. Came with a set of 4 different hooks. Sturdy and worth the money!,1
"Not a fan of the straw. Some times if the straws not open just right it's like your tying to drink peanut butter out of the bottle, but it does keep my drinks ice cold for a long time. Might have to buy a different lid",1
"Paint sprayer does a great job. Not too heavy. Included directions could use more detail (like which nozzle to use for different paint), but info available on Amazon site.",1
HARD TO CLEAN SMALL HOLES IN STRAINER!! PLUGS UP JUICING CELERY,1
worked great for my boat,1
Super cute but they scuff easy. A little big but very comfortable.,1
"Rating based on the following - product as described and quick shipping. At the time of rating this product, I have not used it so I‚Äôm unable to verify how well it works for my needs. It looks better than a previous product purchased from a different seller that didn‚Äôt hold up after 3 uses. Hoping this product will be much better :)",1
good value but a little smaller than expected,1
It looks good and works well.,1
These are little plants when delivered but awesome and healthy. I can't wait to see them grow. Each one was in good shape.,1
"I love this compact bag, but the cell phone pocket is too small for my phone:( Otherwise it is very roomy for cash, credit cards and a few other essentials. Perfect when you don't want to carry a big purse.",1
When I first received the TV the volume was a little off. There was a voice telling you when the volume was turn up and down and her voice was louder than the TV. Once I got into settings and figured it out with the help of some young people the volume is perfect. It is a pretty good TV so far,1
Great jacket you can use it for casual and riding a bike. Very good product on the material. Order one size more so you a have a more comfortable fit.,1
"Although the one I received had a manufacture defect of an upside down image, it is cute and I have contacted the seller about it to resolve the problem. The canvas tote is well made and has leather strapping as handles.",1
The pink is brighter than I expected. It offers no real support. It does work well for holding bottles while pumping.,1
"The shorts are super adorable and comfortable if you size up. Originally purchased an XL, my normal size, they were way too tight. Returned for a XXL and they fit perfectly. They don‚Äôt look exactly like the product picture but they‚Äôre still cute.",1
"Case works well, lasts about a year",1
"I love the colors of this dice set! However, a lot of the white paint paint is chipping from the dots. I have one dot that is completely missing on a dot which is crappy. I will try a paint pen on it and hopefully that works well on the dice!",1
Their site doesn't supp;y a link to driver for windows 7. It arrived two days ago and I'm waiting for a reply from Support.,1
Plastic piece and works as described. You get what you pay for.,1
A decent price on batteries that store's charge way to much for.,1
Love it! Keeps one fresh. Cam really tell when I don't take it.,1
"I love these socks to wander around the house in. They are too thick to wear inside shoes comfortable (to me) but they are super soft and they keep soft through many washings. My only worry is they tend to bunch up at the top and I find strings I have to cut off after almost every wash. I'm really afraid one day I'll go to put them on and they'll have lost their shape around the top. Until then, though, they are fantastic!",1
"My first grow with this light included in the tent. seems to be all good so far , no issues at all. Will know further when this grow finishes up. previously used two 600 watt LED's. I'll see the differences soon.",1
This was a winter in Milwaukee when you needed a hat and neck warmer.,1
Love this unit especially for the price. The only issue that I have is the clock will not keep the correct time. I set it and within 4 or 5 seconds it changes itself back to the original incorrect time. 5 stars if I could fix this.,1
"But maybe l an a snob. Being trained as an editor there is nothing in e-books that drives me crazier than typos, punctuation errors, incorrect words... For example 'he' instead of 'the'-those little things that autocorrect won't catch. One error of that type in a book: ""Okay, it happens."" Two: ""Geez!"" Multiples and l want to take and shake someone. Will l check out the next book in this series? Possibly. Will l continue with it if the editing is no better? Highly doubtful.",1
Everything about this case was fine other than the fact that I had fo file down the pink hard part near the charging port so it doesn't hurt my finger.,1
Fit my Revlon hair dryer well. Doesn‚Äôt wobble or move at all. I like that it has 3 air flow settings. Overall I‚Äôm happy with my purchase.,1
Good phone case! Just wanted something that has a flip cover that can still be used when the cover is closed,1
Well made and effective,1
"For the price, it did everything that I hope it would do and not to mention I even let my window guy try it.",1
This was an ok product. It got the job done but was a little bit of a pain to weed out.,1
"I like all the different sections for my items; however, I wish there were a way to take off the short handles as I used only the should strap.",1
"Not bad for the price, but some of the lids give me trouble when putting them on 5.5 ounce cans - like they‚Äôre just a little bit smaller than the rest in the pack. A couple lids started splitting within a week. Overall these work well and hold up long enough.",1
This is great! My 8 month old thinks he can walk already but doesn't have the best balance. This gives him the support he needs so he can move with more stability. He doesn't always love wearing it because he likes us to hold his hands. But I think this will help him get more comfortable and start walking really soon,1
The best litter scoop we've had works great and is nice and large and looks like it will last forever. Feels like the metal handle ends at the bend so I tend to hold it just below the bend where it feels sturdy.,1
"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3‚Äù, about 115 lbs and the small fit me a bit big. It wasn‚Äôt noticeable visibly so much as comfort, they fit but could be tighter over all. So I gave them to my roommate who is 5‚Äô5‚Äù, about 130 lbs and she loves them! I reordered them in grey because they didn‚Äôt have xs in Black. Over all they are cute and comfy and a solid material and I can‚Äôt wait to get my grey pair!",1
Excellent look and folds easily for storage! Super lightweight if that interests you.,1
They do burn for approximately 1 hour. They are a bit drippy but nothing out of the ordinary. The colors are bright. Even number of each color.,1
This was an enjoyable story!,1
Larger than expected but still worked well. Make sure u use acrylic glue,1
"I mostly like the longer chargers so that I can use my phone while in bed, bad habit i know. With a three pack, i also leave one in the kitchen. The charger arrived and functions as expected. Can never have too many phone chargers. I like the color scheme too, looks tough and heavy duty.",1
The quality of material was better than I expected. Fits fine. A little long.,1
This is an underrated landing spot as there is a lot of collectible loot with relatively little rick as not many players drop there regularly.,1
"It's sturdy and cute altogether, but the phone in general wasn't for me.",1
Love belt clip. Should have felt in holster And enclosed corners but really like,1
"I like it, and am glad I purchased it. The only problem I'm having with it is the comes undone easily. The smallest size they carry is for a 26"" waste, and mine is a little smaller.",1
"These are great for my mom's walker, but I also have to buy several sets at a time. They wear out really quickly. My mom is fairly active and goes out most days so the sidewalks and parking lots ruin these very fast. That's our only complaint. Otherwise a great product to help keep her moving and if there was a way to extend their life I would give 5 stars.",1
"Way better than Stevia. No bad aftertaste like Stevia or Truvia! If you are substituting for sugar, I would just add about 30% more than the recipe calls for.",1
It‚Äôs very nice . Good size bright. Just not towel material.,1
1 string broke! Product came with a second set so after replacing it which took some time was great! Good for kids! So affordable and nice size! Tuner is nice. Turns green when in tune! This product would have got 5 stars had the 1st string not broken!,1
"Good story, but a bit too short. Just when I was getting into it, the story wrapped in a paragraph!",1
Sooo many comes in a cute little zip log sorta bag. My daughter loves them enjoys having cute stuff in her hair so it makes hair time easier for us.,1
It was just like they said it was,1
"Awesome snorkel set! First set I bought that didn‚Äôt take water in the mouth piece when diving down and breaking the surface again. Fin is nice and stiff, goggles and mouth piece very comfortable. One thing to note: sizes run large/wide. I am women‚Äôs size 7/8 so I bought the S/M. It was wider and larger than I would prefer, so I had to tighten the strap all the way, but did not have problems with the fin slipping off.",1
Love the colors & works well with my versa!,1
I am a Minister and I use hundreds of these CR2032 batteries for my religious services in prayer candles every year. I have tried over 15 different brands on Amazon over the past few years and so far this SONY brand has shown the most reliability of any other brands I have tried. Other brands have been cheaper but they also die at an alarming rate thus making the cost go up greatly as I constantly have to replace them with new batteries. I get approximately 5-7 days of use from these batteries as opposed to other brands which vary from 1-3 days with a rapid discharge rate that takes just a few hours to go from a correct level of light to dead in hours. Save your money and time hunting and try these SONY CR2032 batteries. I will keep looking for a LONGER LASTING battery but for now these are the ones I will use until something better comes around. God Bless! Rev. D.,1
Pretty good case I like that it has some grip to it,1
"My kids all have their own laundry hampers. My daughters broke and so I got this one, I like that it is slim and fits in a small place. It's not huge but I didn't want huge because that means I let the laundry build longer. Great hamper!",1
"I actually bought this again for my brother. Personally, I don't feel anything after talking a full bottle. My brother also said he didn't feel anything after taking it. But he still wants it and told me to buy it from Amazon because I am a prime member and he isn't. He said it's probably good if you don't feel anything. Hm...",1
"Came quick, is just as pictured and my daughter loves it. Only thing I do not enjoy is how annoying to alarm tones are. There are several to chose from but they are all very abrasive 90s ringtone-esque. My daughter likes them so I guess thats all that matters.",1
I like the convenience of not having to go to a salon to get my brows done anymore and that it is painless to use.,1
I got this headphone last month. Until now they work great for me: they never come off while I'm running and the sound is really good!,1
"I put this together, and my pup went right in. I put a crate pad in it, and now it's his favorite place to go.",1
"Suspend your analytic mind for a while for this thrilling, adventure. Liked it, will go for book 4. Fun adventure story.",1
The flowers are hard to get out but all around it worked great,1
"Holding together we'll after several wears. Belt is detachable, but therefore has fallen off a couple times. Thin material, so my son wears a thin layer underneath.",1
"You'll need another programmer to replace the bootloader, but you can make one out of a working Arduino, otherwise you'll see a lot of timeout errors.",1
Comfortable shirt. Just a bit snugger than I would have liked. Size up.,1
"Having the Big Book in my smartphone and Kindle e-reader is really a great convenience. I prefer it over a paper copy in Big Book study meetings, because I can add highlights and notes and easily find them later. Searching the text is also a great advantage. I haven't personally found any textual errors The page numbers are broken, though. In the current (as of Oct. 30, 2019) update of the book, ""go to page"" searches are useless. For example, go to page 86 takes you to page 165 of the actual book. Previous updates worked correctly, and I'm confident the publisher will correct the problem, but for now it's annoying and renders the e-book less useful.",1
"This sports bra runs very small I normally wear a small for running or medium if just doing weights. Based on the reviews I ordered a large and it does fit very well without any bulging. It didn‚Äôt move around I didn‚Äôt think anything was going to fall out. But I wish it gave me a more support like a regular bra does. I‚Äôm a 34B, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and 132 pounds. Overall I like the bra. The quality was pretty good for the price. Not flimsy and should hold up. I love the strappy look in the back! I‚Äôm giving it four stars only because I wished it gave me a better shape in the front. I will still be ordering more of these.",1
"I have purchased several of these balloons to the enjoyment of my children. I have only received one bad batch where the balloons looked like they had melted into one another. And the pump broke on the second good balloon. But other than that, loads of fun for your children and the adults that want to use their hot air to entertain them!",1
I loved the color and shape but they are a bit larger (width) than I prefer but all around for the price they are very nice.,1
"Works very well. It is loud and if anyone moves my car door or opens it will go off. It also went off when I shut my other doors and shook the car hard. I tested to see if it goes off if I lean on the door or near it and it didn‚Äôt, so it is not likely to have that many false alarms. If anyone tries to harm your car or break in, they will need more force that just a simple lean or tap. Instructions in English and not too difficult to figure out. Going to buy this for my home door. Would give it five stars if it was more sensitive and loud but t will do the trick and is great for the money",1
Everett and Sylvia are another meet cute romance crafted by Nolan. She seems to have this type of story down to an art - the quick read that sets up the romantic pick me up. Great rrad.,1
Did not like left stem breaking in half like a brittle pretzel only after 4 months .,1
"Works well, having the two zippers is handy when you want to carry a phone and not have all your money/cards go flying when having to remove the phone for use. My daughter uses this one mostly as I preferred one with a bigger pocket but it's more her style and more like a belt than a fanny pack which at 19 years old is apparently a big deal!!",1
"I really like this fitness watch. I like that it tracks my steps, heart rate, and sleep. My only issues that I‚Äôve ran into have been that I hit something once that started a timer and for an hour it ran while I tried to figure out how to turn it off. I still don‚Äôt know how it came on and how it eventually turned off. The charger is a little bit of a pain. Other than that I really like the watch itself. It also is at a great price!",1
"This little gadget makes cutting blocks of cheese soooo much faster. It doesn‚Äôt work great on softer cheeses, but it still does a decent job. My only complaint is you need to use it at the end of the counter if you want to cut all the way through the cheese so you can get the right angle to cut completely through the bottom. But for less then $5, I‚Äôll deal with it!",1
Just needed to get a change in cases,1
Very good and clean. Great deal for the money.,1
"Nice quality of boards, not slippery After using a while there‚Äôre stains which don‚Äôt go out but it doesn‚Äôt effect its purpose",1
A bit tight on my big head but I‚Äôm excited to put to use kinda smelled a bit weird but it‚Äôs fine,1
"I've bought a few different types of wrap-around LED lights in the past couple of years. I thought this design was one of the better ones. The way the plastic lens mounts into the light is clever and it is easy to remove and re-mount. In a garage or a shop with a high ceiling, these lights would cover a big footprint with nice, intense light. In my basement application, where the ceiling is low and the joists collimate the light, more fixtures are needed than I originally imagined, but it's still pretty affordable.",1
This band is just what I needed. It is soft and breathes good enough to evaporate the sweat from my arm while running.,1
Great! Except I thought the aluminum letters would be shinier. More like chrome. However I think the duller looks better on the front of my car ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,1
Does the job giving support. And adjustable when it loosens up.,1
I really like that the water from my dishes drain in to my sink. Even though dishes are on the rack I can still see outside the window! I do not like the fact that I have to pay extra for a silverware tray. It is always needed& should come with the rack!,1
"The HP branded laser-jet ink seems way over-priced, but it works.",1
Nice content and covers a lot of ground but it does get a little repetitive at times.,1
"I liked the historical background coupled with relevant action. Certainly, one gets a feel for the trials and tribulations of being a mountain man.",1
Donated but cute and good quality,1
I liked the characters and the developing relationships. The suspense and uncertainty in the plot kept me reading.,1
It‚Äôs a pretty good brush for the price point. Over the first few uses some of the bristles came out on my face.,1
"Way too long. I'm 5'5"" and need it taken up 3 inches",1
This book goes up against an easy to use and simple to take after outline that will enable you to achieve your weight reduction objectives on the ketogenic eat less more rapidly and strongly than before.This eating regimen takes after the Atkins thin down and other low-carb diets.The recipes are incredibly alluring and at first look enough fundamental.i particularly recommend this.,1
I love these glasses very good condition as I expected it.,1
"The chair is great, but the need to unscrew the foot rest to collapse the chair really takes away from the ease of use.",1
"I really like the look of this band, but there's one thing: when I'm wearing it, if the watch is centered on the top of my wrist, the buckle isn't centered on the bottom. It's almost as if the buckle portion of the band is slightly shorter than ""normal"" and the part with the holes is slightly longer (see image). On the whole I'm happy with it, but this quirk is distracting.",1
The hinge came malfunctioned i contacted and would have to resend tje whole thing they wont just replace the hinge was very upset but my daughter loves it,1
"I got this bag to carry my commander decks and a few other things. Positioning the dividers are a pain to move around but they do their job well once in place. I was a tad disappointed with the fact that only the 2 sides open to the main compartment, and didnt open on one whole side. Also, another neat thing is, if you have the hips for it, you can also wear it like a hip bag so it's more out of the way and everything is still easy to grab. Other than that, fairly good bag, very durable",1
It‚Äôs a good quality jacket for the price. It keeps you very warm (you‚Äôll sweat if you are indoors) It‚Äôs firmly stitched - and the stitches won‚Äôt loosen or come off. So it looks quite durable. The overall look of the jacket is surprisingly quite good. The size is just right. The only thing I‚Äôd say is that it‚Äôs a little puffy - only slightly. It‚Äôs not thin - but is very light.,1
"Nice foundation. Pretty perfect color match. With his foundation a little goes a long way. Even though It is a full coverage foundation, it does not feel heavy on the skin. It does dry quickly, so just keep that in mind. Also it works well thigh other non Revlon products well. I primarily use E.L.F and Smashbox primers. And either Nyx or Slay setting spray. This foundation held up beautifully. The only reason, I did not give 5 stars is because there is no pump. I just transferred it a bottle with a pump and I was good to go.",1
Works good in protecting the phone but had to cut the plastic off in order to make phone calls. It interfered will the sound.,1
"Nice, good quality. But they stretch out and stay stretched",1
"This book started off pretty slow. But it soon got better. After the first few chapters I couldn't put it down. What a wonderful read. I love psychological thrillers, and this book was certainly a good one.",1
"Screws are a bit short, but still really pretty.",1
Authentic but long winded,1
These are very comfortable and I really like them all but the slick soles. I put the skid resistance stickers on them and they help but the don't stay on long.,1
A decent spare pair of sunglasses. I have been leaving these in my car for those times I forget to bring sunglasses when I go out.,1
"Bought this last minute for a funeral (thank you Prime!) it arrived that morning and fit perfectly. Got several complements, great for the price. Arrived pretty wrinkled but came right out",1
"Got the non-ceramic non-stick plates and I love it. After almost two years of weekly use, the non-stick surface still works relatively well. As it got older, it doesn't heat as well. Before my preferred temperature was 2 out of 3, but now I need to start with 3 and leave it a little longer for the first waffle. Still like it.",1
This was super cute. I only wish I hadn‚Äôt sized up. I read some reviews that said it ran small so I got a bigger size. I would have been fine with my normal size. Either way I wore it and my little boy thought it was funny.,1
"ok, but a littel small",1
Exactly as I had hoped,1
these are just fine. they do the job,1
"As others stated - FRONT POCKETS ARE TINY. My phone will fall out while standing up, let alone sitting down. Other than that... these shorts are great, exactly what I wanted. Big, thick and comfy at a great price",1
"*Read the label when buying Protein Supplements *Do some research *Amazons Own Pwr Blend has what you need in the ingredients. Whey Isolate (Quickly Absorbed) , Milk Isolate and Micellar Casein (Slow Release) Its also not as expensive as compared to some other brands which is a big plus. *Taste which to me doesn't matter to much, if the product has the right ingredients ill use it. The Vanilla Ice cream is good, drinkable, no issues but a little on the artificially sweet side. Overall totally worth your money!",1
Wire is on the weak side. No good for active users. Have had a couple of them getting cought on furniture and wires being pulled out of plug. Cheap enough.,1
"They fit any toddler pillow and never fall out (due to envelope style), which is great. A little long on the edges for my pillows, but a decent buy.",1
"We use this as an organizer on my kitchen counter, to replace an ever over-flowing junk bowl. Its really great and helps us cut down on clutter!",1
This product does what it's supposed to do. Mine could have been a little smaller.,1
I was looking for a light that would hold a charge and this one didn't let me down. It is also very bright and will keep me in safety while riding.,1
"With no experience to draw from and only going from recommendations from others as to the weight of the BB's, I purchased this brand based on the number of positive reviews and the price/quantity. So far no issues...",1
Works as advertised. The design is awkward in that it extends just enough to cover two plugs. And all the rings are annoying except the first one. :),1
"Not one size, if yuo have a large head it is a little tight.",1
So weird but sooo good!,1
Good phone case gets the job done. Cheap. Holds up to 3 cards. I had this case for the iPhone 6 but the only problem for the 8 is that it‚Äôs pretty bulky.,1
"While this product has rather mild taste to it, I don't find it to make the product any lesser for it.",1
"I bought this brush to add exfoliating more often in my skin care routine. I love that it's light weight and comfortable to hold. It's easy to switch speeds while in use. Most important to me, since I have really sensitive skin,is that the bristles are really soft but effective. Another plus is it stays charged for a long while (mine does anyway). I will recommend after useing and washing the brush, pat it dry with a clean towel. I noticed the first time I used it I capped it and even with the air vent in the cap it stayed wet, so definitely pat with towel after use. One other thing its comes with the charging cable but you will need a charging port, but heck like lots of people I had an extra so that was easy :)",1
Very happy with this purchase.,1
Love this mirror.. highly recommend,1
One handed use makes driving safer. So far the mount seems secure; 100+ temperatures next summer will be a good test.,1
So the set up was a nightmare took hrs to set up. Can only be done on your phone. What helped me was turing off my cell data. Haven‚Äôt tried the music or any special features yet. Really just need it to check on the kids. Would recommend if your willing to save money for a decent product with a lot of work to set up.,1
Great product! Ordered large and a medium would have worked better.,1
Nice heavy T-shirt for the price I paid!!,1
Like the kit but the rubber holder should be a little bigger to hold the club closer to the grip it would make it easier but it still works,1
Sometimes comes unclipped.,1
"Its ok, I probably would have chosen something a bit more substantial. I'm using them to secure Hobie pedal drives and seats on a tandem island. I hope they hold on to them if I dump it and they come loose. For the use I chose I would have been a bit happier with a larger strap, but they should work great for rods and paddles which might be where they end up.",1
looks nice for the price,1
I'll let u no as I use it,1
I expected them to be cheaply made but they were better than I thought they would be,1
Strap broke off both ends after 4 days of use. Updated The company sent me a replacement bigger right away. Unfortunately the handle broke off of the replacement bag within a few days as well. Updated The company has continued to be very responsive and continually works to ensure my problems have been solved. I have now received two replacement bags free of charge to ensure I received a good product.,1
I got this for my daughter who has really long hair and wanted to try one instead of using a regular towel. She likes it because it's so simple to use.,1
I have this light in my attic. It lights it up like it is daytime up there! The only big improvement I see is that I would like the arms to be able to flex upwards a bit to change the angle instead of being flat to inwards.,1
"Very soft and comfortable, I have several pairs in other colors.",1
"This is super cute and I have it on my patio door. It doesn‚Äôt exactly block the wind from coming in, but it does seem to eliminate the coldness of the door. Also cats.",1
Excellent colour and quality of material. Also very spacious and handy.,1
"Nice thin simple protection for my Macbook. Snaps on easily and keeps it from bumps and dings. Nice price for the case, too.",1
My kids love this! I wished I ordered two of this for my kids. They fight over using it all the time. They used it so much that it‚Äôs starting to squeak loudly every time they use it.,1
i have bought these shorts in multiple prints. they are so fun and the fabric is soft. i give the 4 stars instead of 5 because they do ride up a bit when you walk so i find myself tugging them frequently but i still love them. if i drop a few lbs maybe the ride up won't be an issue. i'll update the review if/when i drop the weight. LOL,1
"This spinosaurus is solid, sturdy and heavy, looks very nice. lower jaw can move. only complaint is the teeth are a little fragile, some teeth fell off after playing with it for a few days.",1
"Best phone price - quality, it lags some times but nothing to worry about, the camera does not shoot good photos at low light and has no any kind of stabilization, everything else xiaomi did it just right",1
Looks awesome and made well. Looks movie quality. Would give 5 stars but it was slightly snug. Other than that it was perfect,1
Filter looks and fit on car like the original one.,1
Very nice and fresh bold taste of the extra virgin olive oil from amazon itself. It's super in my bruschetta !!!,1
"Great puzzle. Well-made and sturdy. NIce bright colors that draw my toddler in. Plus, it has pegs that help him pick up and place each piece in its appropriate slot. Highly recommend it for home, classroom or as a gift!",1
I purchased these to use with my Instant Pot and they work well.,1
"The towel was a gift for my dear friend who loves it, it works great!!",1
"This is wonderful for garlic. My only issue is that I thought it was made in Spain, but it dies nit say so, on the item.",1
"The one I gave this as a gift to likes it. So, I am good with that:)",1
"I already broke the little guy under the vise by over tightening. So I made a new little guy for leverage. And also drilled and tapped a hole in the back for an eye bolt, for rotational lock up. I really like the vise and I would buy it again if I ever need two of them.",1
This product does work however u have to bomb spray vacuum wash or nothing will work,1
The cover fits perfectly on my Garmin g10 GPS. It will help keep it protected from everyday use and possible damage.,1
Returned. Would not fit on our type screen door.,1
"Wasn't sure if this would fit properly on the Libman wet mop that we have, but these worked out really well.",1
"Good soap, specially for the price. Nothing too premium but great for maintenance washes with some wax in it.",1
Pros: Bags are very full! Seems like they are made to last Has built in buckle to latch both bags together Con: rear bag doesnt hold the butt of the gun upright enough because its a shallow V shape instead of deep U Front bag is so wide doesnt help hold gun up just helps it be level All in all cant complain cuz i dont see any better alternatives at this pricepoint,1
"So I was the drink holder was bigger. That is why I originally purchased this. There is also a spot for what looks like it would fit a credit card but it does NOT. Others I have seen since I bought this one, have a compartment for change. This one does not. However, on the plus size, it does prevent things falling in between the seat. I also found other uses for the ""drink holder"" part. Overall, I am happy since price was reasonable",1
Very pretty. Perfect in my daughter‚Äôs room. It is very lightweight & obviously inexpensive however.,1
It definitely helps keep things tight and allows for longer play. It can be a little cumbersome to put on and takes more time than I thought it would. It will also cause a lot of sweat in the area it covers. Just washing it today so we will see if it holds up after wash.,1
A different type of music from Keith but well done. Good featured artists.,1
"Great Light & Useful for Photography, Auto Detailing & as a Replacement to Work Lights. The Stands are a bit cheesy but the remainder is very nice they are now my go to for all things garage related and photography. With a set of batteries they even make a great backup / portable work light!",1
Great product. Not over soapy. Rinses quite well. Smell is natural and not overly pungent,1
"Very easy to follow cookbook, but not much variety. Mostly taco recipes.",1
This is a very durable very secure door lock we like it alot the one downside would be there are no finger grips to help open this door lock once it is closed.,1
Works great but it‚Äôs dented not that I care that much.,1
"This is super cute. It has a drawstring under the chin to adjust to your dog‚Äôs head size. The tail piece is too small for my dog but he is missing the tip of his tail so the end of his tail is thick, not tapered. The mane probably won‚Äôt stay on for long but my dog won‚Äôt tolerate it for long anyway. I gave it 4 stars because it‚Äôs not as fuzzy as the main picture would have you think.",1
Works great once I figured out how to configure my new TV to switch to optical audio out.,1
Did a great job on my neck,1
"arrived quickly, great color goes with everything",1
"I puchased this for use as a tick repellent for my dogs, and it smells good, so I use it as well.",1
"Not as good as the old US made files, but perfectly acceptable quality. I would purchase again.",1
nice video and sound,1
This is a great game especially if you enjoy Cards Against Humanity. My only complaint is that we seemed to have duplicate cards which I think it would have been more fun given something new and different each hand.,1
Not as good as the stuff with silicone but probably one of the best water based I've had,1
Its not AS nice as it is in the picture but it is still cute,1
does not transfer at easily as some vinyls but it‚Äôs still really good!,1
"I've only been using this product for about a month, so I can't say that this has helped me get pregnant yet, but I can say that my cycle has definitely changed since using this product.",1
"Very pretty. Adjustable chain size is a plus, but lace could be longer to surround back of neck a bit more.",1
I was scared to order another whip. I had a couple in the past there where terrible lasted maybe one ride out. The moment this whip came to the house i knew it was very high quality. this whip is very solid i am very happy. I was so excited when i installed it i forgot it was still on and i went into my garage and it racked over my garage door. i was scared it broke it. I was able to get it off. It didn't even have a scratch on it. I bent it in half and no worries at all. I can not be more happy with it. also A few days after it was delivered there customer service contacted me to make sure everything was in order. My only complaint is the wiring harness is a little short. I wired it to a toggle switch it barely made it. was not able to make a super clean install. still not a deal breaker.,1
Seems to be decent quality and holds my phone well while watching Netflix. Could be a few inches shorter for storage but I am use to it now. This item is as described.,1
Really is a well built product overall. Only wish that the velcro pad on back side was larger and the actual pad size was larger.,1
Good curtain but 4 stars because the rings are cheap and flimsy.,1
Good value until you realize that they‚Äôre all small measurement cups. I do mean ‚Äúsmall‚Äù!,1
Fit was kind of large,1
"I love this game, but I am playing on a tablet and it kicks me out can you please fix this bug",1
"Awesome tote but mine came with the paw print upside-down. Sending back, which is annoying to have to do.",1
After reading some reviews I was skeptical about which size to order & I went with the 18-20 just in case because I have wide hips & some booty & I'm 7 months pregnant. They fit & actually could be little more snug & they'd be perfect. All & all I'm pretty satisfied. They're pretty light & definitely not going to be hot on me for the rest of this awful hot & humid summer in the South :),1
"This works well, only issue is that it‚Äôs a little bit heavy",1
I think the manufacturers are from France. French writing on the cover.,1
"All tested and working properly upon arrival, seem to be just what I was looking for.",1
"Got in mail to-day. Very quick ship. Arrived with charge in it so that was good. Flashlight works, gives a good spark, nice and noisy, bought it for dogs on my walk. Go on a walk with my new stun gun, and a neighbor down the road was working on his car and forgot to close the gate and his pit bull ran out at me. It was in my pocket and I was not ready, but got it out, sparked it and pitty the pit bull backed off. Of course the owner also called it off, so not really a good test, but dog did look a little perturbed when it was noisily sparking. Taught me a lesson: If dogs in area have it 'ON' and in the hand while walking. In the pocket and turned off cost me time, because I was fumbling to get it out. That dog came quick. The alarm is not ear piecing, it's okay, nothing to write home about. It's well made, the price is right, so I'm very happy with it. Would recommend.",1
"First I received the wrong product, but the customer service was stellar and prompt. I like this chair and would order from this seller again",1
Had to return the 1st one because it broke. Replacement is fine.,1
"The hat is nice, but the knit is too tight for the hat to show any sign of looking like it is a slouch hat!",1
"These have an off and on switch which allows me to listen to calls via my pc. I connect my headset to it via USB and when I want to speak via my pc, I switch it to on and then I can talk. Would have given it 5 stars if the cable was a little longer.",1
I would purchase again.,1
"I got one of these back when they first started gaining popularity. I will say that this is by far the best protection for your ankle. I had a damaged ankle when I started trying out for professional soccer teams and I was wearing one of these the entire time. I ended up getting picked up and was able to play in Sweden. This brace went above and beyond to protect my ankle so I could achieve my dream. My ankle did end up blowing out when I kicked the ball at the same time as another player that came from the side of me, but it was a ticking time bomb anyway and nothing in the world would have prevented that. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it seems like the velcro has changed. Back when I got my first one, the velcro stuck very strong and it would never come loose. I just purchased two new ones and the velcro straps are always coming undone.",1
"I bought two sets of these to fill six empty ear piercings. Overall, I‚Äôm happy. They are very pretty, and they match my more expensive white opal jewelry. Packaging: each set comes in its own small plastic bag sealed with an adhesive strip. There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn‚Äôt get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can‚Äôt see behind my ear of course. I‚Äôve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased. I have very sensitive skin, and I‚Äôve experienced no irritation. The balls have not loosened, and the jewels still fit securely in their settings. I originally wanted to get real white gold jewelry, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll need to anytime soon.",1
"So I just got this serum, I really love it mixing with my lotion of the same brand, the only thing I don‚Äôt appreciate is the bottle.. it‚Äôs so hard to get the serum out.. I wish they can do sumthin about their packaging bcoz this is frustrating if you like me wanting to mix in other body lotions .. gettin it out is a struggle",1
"The best thing about these phones is the Bluetooth stays solidly connected to my Apple Watch. Unlike some other earbuds I‚Äôve tried, these don‚Äôt skip at all. I‚Äôve had no issues with the battery life... I‚Äôve never had them run out while I‚Äôm using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It‚Äôs slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don‚Äôt fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It‚Äôs angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.",1
This item is very helpful.,1
The product works just as it was described. But I do find some of the lids don‚Äôt stay closed. Would love to be able to purchase some replacements,1
"This is a little confusing at first, but once you get it all set up, it's great. Only thing that I would recommend to extend battery life would be to get rid of display on the wireless sensors. Other than that, exactly what I was looking for.",1
works great - just wish it had netting on the front also,1
"Very pretty, but smaller than I had thought.",1
It was for kids tablets and they like them but they need a better stand when you fold the back down. It just doesn‚Äôt work well but otherwise great product.,1
"I really like this product for out the lake . We now have six , not saying they are in good shape. NOT but usable until the last 2. They are nice style because I like to have the control. Pros and cons ... but no horse playing. The last 2 however the seams are coming apart already and we have not spent much time on them. . I have that many as if company the are great to sit and talk with your yeti. They do fade quickly but we we do keep them on the boat and sun kits them. I have to be re sewing them several times. But think now have to pitch they are torn & threaded and beyond repair. And as others say line inner tube Line up before adding air. If I get a years out of 2 I‚Äôm happy. Also I hate plastic and fabric cover is so much nicer. To the Company please do more stitching and maybe heavier material closer sewn & if the bottom material was little thicker it last longer. I do like just up grade. We will pay extra for quality to last longer. Going to have to sew my new 2 , Sadly already May just been flaws idk. But those are disappointing. But I continue to order until I find a similar style better quality and husband wold like his little larger. These work ... Pass return time now. An I do like loop on back so you can tie off to the boat if water is high or you don‚Äôt want to drift to far. Or get off and don‚Äôt have to pull in boat each time.when you go back in the water. But honestly they look well made I thought we put to much air in but we did not. Not our first we are careful Wish they replace. Or go on sales it‚Äôs prime day as I was looking for a sale. Didn‚Äôt take last 2 out until the season. They are priced ok but . Let me enjoy a season.",1
we put these rugs in the front of our tent they work great collecting all the dirt so it does not get into the tent.,1
This one a good read. I started to read it and thought I wasn't for me but the more I read the more I get into it.,1
"Very soft, kind of cheap - but good for the price.",1
"I've never owned really expensive hiking poles, but I honestly can see what they would have or do that these don't.",1
"I love these, the colors are great and they greatly reduce my makeup application time over powder eyeshadows! I only gave it 4 stars because I ordered both sets (bright and soft) and got two of the soft colors, none of the bright colors. Side note,, you can use these along wit eyeshadow to make some pretty creative looks.",1
Fits and works great,1
The shakers are really cute but a little bigger then I imagined. No issues with salt and pepper spilling from the seams. After a week of adjusting to the size I absolutely love them. Really good price quality for the price.,1
I am not sure how I feel about the mixed colors..they kind of make it hard to color nicely..some of the colors don't go together well,1
"I really like these capris. I ordered three. I work out in them and because they don't look like workout capris, I can wear them with a long tunic and the whole outfit looks very nice.",1
"Really pretty ring, not had it long enough to say if it will wear well or not",1
"Somewhat of a slow start but a very good read, regardless. I had a really hard time putting the book down towards the end when the plot really changes. Definitely a good book!",1
Was not an exact match with my generator however it works fine and I am satisfied.,1
"Somewhat predictable, but still an interesting read.",1
Works good kinda thick but if they aren‚Äôt cold they will work fine,1
It‚Äôs great and sturdy. I‚Äôve dropped my iPad once with this cover and it didn‚Äôt pop out so it‚Äôs really durable to me. I don‚Äôt like how it barely fits in the groove though and the slightest movement will make my iPad collapse down. :/ other than that‚Äôs its a great product,1
"Had for like 2 years and it‚Äôs great but started falling apart after a good year or so, would buy again!",1
"Colorful, educational. Sticks to the sides of the tub for learning and pointing out for little ones. I just wish there were more of an assortment. My grandson does enjoy playing with them and he is only 2 and can identify these ocean animals by sight now.",1
I used this on my bed as a cover for my mattress under my fitted sheet and I love it it has deep pockets so it doesn‚Äôt slip of my mattress constantly,1
Really cute and comfy!!,1
Easy and straightforward does the job.,1
"I liked everything about the engagement calendar, but think the paper is thinner than it used to be.",1
Very nice looks pretty,1
"everything is good all over fast delivery except, equality and the size the fabric too thin and size you should order two sizes larger than what you required",1
Taste isnt the greatest but what vitamin is. I dont take any vitamin or medicine without food or drink anyway. So as long as you do that then your fine. I actually bought for this my pregnant daughter. She agrees with this review. I like the fact that they have iron in them which my vitamins dont. So thats a plus right there for me and just about any pregnant woman.,1
"This was a simply written. There was enough discription of each charactor. There were a lot of characters that you had to keep straight through out the book. The story centered around a group of retired SWAT team officers and invading China and North Korean armies. There was a little bit of the story dealing with and history of how and why their was an invasion, not more about anything further. The editor and proof reader needed to spend more time reviewing the book, alot of missing words through the story. So I'm wondering if Mr. Moore will continue the story.",1
Book came just as described. Sentences for my daughter to finish and personalize. Only gave 4 stars because only 1 cover design available,1
It works really good,1
"It's not as bubbly as the other Shea moisture baby wash, so I prefer the other one.",1
The enter key is alittle small but you adjust to it eventually. for the price it's a good deal. the enter key needs to be bigger and hopefully in the future not as loud.,1
The ergonomics or design of this product made it impossible to use. It fit on the back of my tv where the USB port is snug between two other outlet jacks and it is impossible to fit this product there because it‚Äôs outlet prevents plugging it in right above another jack. This design prevented me from using this device which seems well-made.,1
I have been using this product for the past 5 days and it seems to work to an extent.,1
"This works really well, but you do have to turn the cob over and it's not always easy to get it aligned, but works perfect for my daughter who likes corn but not on the cob, and my elderly father who doesn't have the bite anymore to eat corn on the cob. Quickly shipped also.",1
Very well made and easy to pop on and off. Four stars because it sits pretty high up in the middle making it hard for my son to use on his own.,1
"My 3 month old peed alllll over it, and it all stayed on the pad. It's on the small side. So I say it's great for new babies, and can handle everything little babies throw at it. I will likely upgrade to larger pads in the next few months.",1
Nice wallet. One of the zippers is a little tough to open and close.,1
It's a mat for working out that works as it should. Makes my workouts on my hardwood floors much easier.,1
"It looks good, but not really to assemble.",1
Great product I have it in the grille so it‚Äôs not as bright as I wanted but it works perfect,1
"Avid fan, was please with my purchase.",1
"I would have given 5 stars if they didn‚Äôt frey, but super soft and great for my little newborn. I will be buying more",1
It‚Äôs hard to find a cane with this handle configuration. It gives you a comfortable handle with center of gravity straight above the shaft of the cane itself.,1
Great price just because of color,1
"My note 8 always runs out of battery, as I use on Qhd display while using my phone. This case comes in handy as I can use my phone while it is charging. It has two functionalities. 1. Battery case. 2. Power bank. This case be turned on and off by clicking on the button behind the case. It's a bit bulky to hold on to. But it's useful when you really are out of juice and travelling.",1
great to neat'n up computer Desk.,1
I really like this product. It‚Äôs easy to use and works very well.,1
"Good book, I enjoyed reading it.",1
Very nice a good flow for putting out the medicine . Very quiet machine..Being used daily works great...will order another,1
"Unless I have a special G8, this has a couple of extra features that don't seem to fit the phone: - extra button cover on the left side, which makes 3 buttons, my G8 has only the volume up/down buttons there - two extra holes on the right side, toward the bottom which expose nothing bu the phone case I guess that's what ""compatible"" means, not perfect fit, but will work fine :-) The main purpose of the case is however achieved: stopping this darn phone from sliding on any surface that is not perfectly horizontal!",1
Neck is lower than picture probably because of weight of this stretch knit but launders well.,1
"Not great if your are at the river and walking on rocks. They get stuck in the bottom. The bottom is a little thin too, so not as comfortable as I originally thought. They are lightweight and easy to put on.",1
This shoes is very comfortable,1
Love the vintage/noir feel! Very Interesting and different cinematic approach from scene to scene. Cinematography was beautiful! Very enjoyable.,1
"Thin polyester printed exactly as it looks in this pic! Lightweight no China smell, no texture really",1
"Not as pictured as far as flavors or colors are shown. There are only red, orange green and yellow. None of the good colors or flavors. They work well.",1
"I ordered the blueish gray color and it's really pretty. I decided to give the dress to my mom since she loves cold-shoulder. It's a basic dress, can't go wrong with it. I wish it was slightly more form fitting, but it looks good on my mom!",1
"Adorable, durable and fits well for the price. My 3 year old daughter loves it!",1
Happy with quality of product and the Gates brand name.,1
"Nice product very soft, great quality!",1
"Very comfortable, would recommend",1
It‚Äôs pretty low tech but does what you want it to do.,1
Great clean looking product. Wish it had a place for loose papers but still very well thought out item for the money,1
Fun pack of stickers that I used as treats during science day presentations. They're not super sticky but they work fine on paper. They even included Pluto in the mix which the kids thought was amazing.,1
"It was just a teensy bit small, the fabric is thin but makes it very soft. I love it! I've had a difficult time finding team bandanas, and the price was great! I will update after some wear and tear....",1
"A little on the expensive side, but it does help with puppy pimples. Our bulldog gets zits sometimes from eating yogurt and this helps make them go away quick. Would recommend.",1
"it‚Äôs i little bit big, but really cute and comfortable. i‚Äôve gotten so many compliments wearing this shirt",1
"The small 60X and 90X lenses are too small to be of any use, but the large 30X lens and LED work perfect for what I use it for (Examining watches at flea markets before I buy). There is no On/Off switch for the LED as it turns on as soon as you open it, but if you push it back in a tiny amount, it will shut off. For less than $10, it really is a good deal.",1
"Good keyboard for the money. Been using for the past month, no issues.",1
"We only use the clock for time, not as an alarm. The letters are large and easy to read from across the room. However, even the dim setting is pretty bright. I would prefer something even dimmer to minimize the amount of light in the bedroom. The power cable has uses a USB connection but does not include a USB power adapter in the box.",1
"The kids will have a good laugh when they go through this book. It's full of hundreds of funny yet simple to understand jokes that are bound to keep them entertained for hours on end. I chose this rating because I thought this book was sooper funny. I didn't dislike this joke book at all I loved all of the clean jokes for kids. It was really inspiring. I honestly would recemend this book to anyone who likes jokes, because after reading this book you will love jokes and be inspired to right jokes like I was.",1
The screen protector was not glass like it said it was didn't last but two months,1
"I purchased this exhaust to replace an old Broan that sounded like an airplane. While this unit is not completely silent, it Is a very low sounding extractor. Verify your measurements before you purchase. My electrician had to work pretty hard to install this unit. Overall, I am very pleased.",1
"Product was as described. You can buy direct from Mfg. in bulk for a discount Taste is pretty good. I add it to low carb home made shakes. Mixes well A tad expensive, but you use very little per day. Comes with 1/2 tsp measure cup",1
Great OEM battery. Performs just like original.,1
It's been a while since I have been in love with a book and this is right up there as a great read,1
It came as it was described.,1
"Although it was a little difficult to install on my 3D printer, it probably wouldn't be for many. My Maker Select V2 was never designed for it and I had to rewire the machine to allow it to work. That isn't of any fault to the BLTouch. It's worked flawlessly.",1
For the price serviceable,1
Beautiful!! I really enjoy this product. I wish the top screwed on to be secure but other than that nice product.,1
I work in a fiberglass factory on the furnace level. Wet this down to help cool me off. It works. I wear a hat over it and I dont have any issues so far. This is my first week with it. Only reason I havent put 5 stars is because Its so new.,1
Had problem at first installing it. Called manufacture and got the help I needed.,1
"Just received this bag yesterday. It is very cute and looks like it will hold up. There are several pockets inside and outside of the bag which is nice. The beige top of the bag arrived with several black spots on it. Some wiped clean and I‚Äôm hoping the others will come off with some soap. Looks like it may have happened during packaging. It‚Äôs a bummer that it came dirty but the outer material is easy to wipe down! It is a good size, will hold a lot without being cumbersome!",1
Bought for a gift ! Hoping my daughter in law likes. The earrings look nice!,1
Very happy with this.,1
It's what I ordered but some got broken in transit and I think a little more packaging cushion would have been ideal.,1
Loose but feels great still! Material kind of think but again still feels nice. Love the length!!,1
"It was a very pretty gift to give, and allot more sturdy then I believed, my mom loved it. I did expect it to be a bit bigger, the betty boop in the middle is small and easily over looked",1
This book was very interesting. I knew i had to read it when it said mind reader- i`m a sucker for them!,1
"A perfect find Beautiful perfect great, Awesome cord!!! These cords are great.",1
"The glass carafe is perfect. The handle has a beautiful shape but is a bit hard for my older hand to grasp. The lid is a bit small and has this strange filter suspended near the spout, not sure what it is supposed to do. The kettle wouldn't shut off after the water boils. Was it defective? No just had to get out my college science hat and remember that at our 5,000 foot elevation water boils at 2 degrees less per 1,000 feet of elevation. So when the water boils it is only 202 not 212 degrees f as at sea level, not high enough to trigger the shut off switch. An option would be to set it at 195 degree ""keep warm"" if you need an automatic shut off. That is fairly close to 202 degrees. We have used the kettle at least 2 times daily for 3 months. It is so much better than the old metal kettle on the stove. I doubt you are going to find anything much better or as practical.",1
"This dress is beautiful, well made and of great quality materials. The matching bloomers, however are much too small to fit over a diaper.",1
a little pricey for the quality feel.,1
I bought this espresso set for my boss as a gift. It came in very nice and sturdy package. I was afraid that it will arrive broken from my last experience ordered glass item but didn‚Äôt have any problems at all. Great size. Not too small and it has very unique shape. The only reason I am giving 4 stars is vecause the leaf plate is a bit too smooth.,1
look for battery compartment on the side. Tried it of one car - showed excessive water in brake fluid. going to test it on a new can of fluid just to be sure.,1
"I love that the lights are bright, flash and change colors. They demand attention. I hope people see me and avoid hitting me rather than wonder ""what is that?"" and run me over to get a closer look. So, I wrapped them around the pole. It looks awesome. But the next day, the clear, squishy plastic came off in places. Don't try this at home. Even if I did no harm, it doesn't look good. I bought two, one had a rip in the plastic. The replacement will go on the other pole without getting bent, twisted,rolled or mutilated.",1
It works well. Comes with everything to get started except for remote control batteries.,1
"It's great to have a brush that also blow dries my hair! It was a little confusing what the 3 settings actually do. Thankfully, the seller sent an email to explain: LOW--Cool Heat & High Air Speed MIDDLE--Warm Temp & Low Air Speed HIGH--Hot Temp & High Air Speed **Please note that the sign of settings indicates the heat and temperature, not the air speed. In other word, there are 3 level of heat and 2 blower speed. It is different from other hair dryer and it is easy for you to have a confused idea that settings are broke. If you encounter this confusion, please be eased. This helped to clear up the confusion. Good product!",1
"Beautiful; however, much smaller in size than a regular greeting card. The size of card is reason for not rating as a *****Star.",1
"An all time family favorite! Customizing the cards used in each game keeps it interesting, especially when I let the kids decide",1
Like that they feel cool when on. Wanted them for sun protection while golfing.,1
Good book that takes you back to original movie. Would recommend to any age group. Easy read also. Many memories of what one learned when saw the movie.,1
Smells good but fades fast,1
Looks cute! I think it will be popular with my granddaughter?! (Christmas stocking gift),1
I have a 90 yr old friend who is having serious dry mouth issues. She was using Biotene spray but it didn't last long enough for her problem and she had a hard time talking due to dry mouth. I sent her these and she loved them so much that she shared with her neighbor at the assisted living facility. He loved them so much he said he'd buy the next box and share with her. I'm grateful!,1
This is an extremely cute and comfy dress. Definitely would be a great go to dress. I am returning it though because it is a little too long on me and kind of makes me a look a little frumpy. I noticed on most people it appears to hit just below the knee but it goes about mid calf for me. I am 5‚Äô3,1
"Installed the first of four of them I ordered and I learned not to tighten down collar too tight or the ""loose"" collar above it is difficult to align for the camera. Other than that, pretty easy to install.",1
I bought the clear. They aren't flimsy and they do what they are supposed to do.,1
Very cute workout tanks. The material seems good. They are much smaller than expected. I wear a medium and they fit like a small. Order a size up if you don‚Äôt want it tight and form fitting.,1
"good pruduct , fast service",1
"Bought 4 sacks, 3 different brands. This is a great sack. The reason this one is cheaper than the others is because it doesn‚Äôt have a removable cover. The outer cover is the only cover (other brands have stuffing in a sack, with a zipper so you can add more stuffing) and that sack goes inside the shell. It is made with two zippers. Zipper inside a zipper. Shell feels a little thicker than the other brands, but not as soft. Same amount of stuffing included. Outer shell might be the only real difference.",1
"Did the job, cable is very small gauge",1
Does not fit as flattering as I thought it would but its and okay product,1
My only complaint is that the handle is hollow and digs into your hand. Wear gloves. I use it to store 100 ft of 12/3 cord which fits comfortably (it won't hold anything longer at this gauge) Would definitely recommend.,1
Pretty good product for the price. My only complaint is the lashes don‚Äôt seem to have a curve to them which made application extremely difficult. Does the job for a good price. Note: it does not come with lash glue,1
"Wig is super soft and very pretty. Only issue is that it‚Äôs a bit small, other than that it looks and feels great.",1
Great shoes for doing chores at the barn BUT they could be a little wider. I do find they hurt my baby toes but I have plenty of room in the length. I bought the next bigger size hoping they wouldn't hurt my feet.,1
"Mount works great. Only down fall is that the TV is tight to the wall, if plugs/inputs are on the backside of TV, you will need to add spacer to the mount to push it away from the wall.",1
I loved this series of books (Ancient Origins) and just read the series a second time. The author is unique and I like that. I do hope there is another book in this series.,1
I have heard of these ultrasonic pest control gadgets but have never used them before. I was tired of using chemicals to get rid of my bug and rodent problem. I have a cabin in the woods and we will get mice from time to time. I have now had this installed now for several weeks and no sign of anything. Usually when we go away for a few day and find some dropping when we return. Nothing yet so far. I am hopeful. There is no sound or odor. If the critters stay gone I'll change my review to a 5 star.,1
"Very nice, well made.",1
"Arrived on time and well packaged. Have not tried all the scents, but the ones I have smell nice.",1
The only reason this doesn‚Äôt get 5 stars is because it globs up in water making a thick paste. Otherwise AWESOME buy for the price. Works great in coffee and shakes but globs up and sticks to the bottom in a pitcher of water.,1
"This was more than a story about cricket - this was a story of a young, strong muslim women trying to pursue her dream to play a sport in India. Her struggles to overcome her culture and traditions were inspiring and eye opening. The cinematography was gorgeous - I loved the feeling of being in India. The music was spot on and the over all story/message was enlightening. I hope everyone can see this film. Well done!",1
"The shoes are decent quality (especially considering the price.) I ordered the tan color and it is true to the photos. I wear a size 8 and while I do sometimes have to size up when I'm wearing boots (to accommodate thick socks) I dont usually with flats. With this pair my toes fit snugly into the front of the shoe and the width of the shoe is a bit tighter than I usually like, but not too uncomfortable. I am hoping that as I break them in that issue will be solved. If not, if i were to buy another pair, I would consider going up a half size.",1
This os a great cover if u have the pokeball plus and want to keep it clean and scratch free. The only down side seems that the charging stand that i got will not charge with the case on. Seems to also make the ball a little bit bigger too. Wish the clear one was available. Overall seems like a great product.,1
"The foam does not feel like memory foam. It actually feels kinda hard and rough, but it's comfortable enough. I suppose the toughness of the foam gives me some confidence that it will last me for awhile and won't break down or become flat. It feels better to use the cushion, than without it or with a regular seat/pillow cushion. Upon arrival, it had a strong rubbery smell that also stinks anything that it touches, but the smell seems to goes away over time and becomes less noticeable. I think the cost should be cheaper for the quality. Overall, I like the cushion and it's been helpful for my piles when I need to sit for long periods.",1
Provides great ideas and practical methods without hundreds of hours of practice. I found the book quite useful.,1
Wow! Pats life story is amazing. Enjoyed this book and think it would make a great movie. Rabbit doesn't hold back and it shows her life story was one that had to be told.,1
The reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is the color. The color says bronze but in actually it is almost black. I wanted a dark brown color.....,1
It does moisturize. Its light enough and didn't lead to breakouts for me .,1
THIS IS A TRUSTWORTHY COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND ITS PRODUCT. BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW IT WORKS WITH THIS NEW HP 'STUDENT PRINTER' THAT STILL HAS ITS ORIGINAL INK CARTRIDGES.,1
Just put it together,1
Best flashlight I've ever owned. Love the magnetic base and its extremely bright. It's not 2000 lumen. Friend at work had 1500 lumen light that was a bit brighter. A little bulky to fit in your pocket though. But you get 2 of them so I'm not complaining!,1
"Being from Louisiana myself and having married into a Cajun family I really enjoy these stories. This particular one had laughs in the right places, but the development of Miss Prim and Proper was too simple. A writer herself Miss Prim and Proper should have had more interest in just what the ladies past experiences had been. All in all a good read before sleeping.",1
"We used these for the first time this past week, as hoped they were much better than a traditional snorkel set. We we were able to breath normally, see clearly and no water got into the mask. We did have an issue getting the mask snug at first (and the enclosed directions were not very helpful) but we were able to figure it out .",1
This story was told in a wonderful way. I like how you got to know the whole family and all the background. I would recommend this book! Really enjoyed it.,1
"My dog finds this pretty edible - we used the tablets for some time, but eventually he started leaving them or turning up his nose. Since this gets mixed into his food, he does well with it. Packaging is good - although I'm not fond of this type of security seal. Shipping is on time as well.",1
Too many dark things around what could have been a beautiful wedding. Dogs played a very small role. Others in the series have been better.,1
This one works great on my LG phone. It's small size and very portable. I like the white color. Nothing to complain.,1
"Loved it!! BUT... Arrived with a broken tail, with that said to avoid the hassles of returning it we improvised and hide his tail in the gravel. Makes a wonderful addition to our tank and my son LOVES it!!!",1
"The fit is a bit snug on medium sized hands. I like these a lot, but I feel like the thickness of the pad is a bit much. Does a good job of protecting your hands but the tradeoff is that you lose bar feel.",1
"Love everything about this bag, but I do wish there were pockets to put other things like snacks, treats, a leash, etc. Otherwise my puppy and I love it. Have already tested it on bike rides and it really helps us bond.",1
I like these. Great for starter throwing knifes. Strong tips hold up well after multiple throws.,1
"These are great, they taste like normal, wheat pasta. A great alternative for low carb diets",1
"I just finished this book today. I have to admit, the further I got into this book, the more it kept me engaged. I am not sure who the target reader is for this book, as there are many who could find something worthwhile in it, but it makes sense that it is in the Contemporary fiction genre. It is true to life and very realistic. The character of Swain becomes more likable as the story moves on. With each chapter, the drama of Swain's recent life, the divorce, and the loss of his daughter all unfold. I felt for him in his losses and in his joys that he feared to embrace for so long. The Jones character seems to simply exist as a foil to Swain's character; he is the jerk of a friend that one just can't let go of. The details of living in Hong Kong and the ups and downs of living on a boat were pretty interesting. I saw some areas that could use another edit, but other than that the writing was well-done, the vocabulary was vivid, and the story was engaging.",1
Fantastic product to use for sunburn. Delivery was prompt too.,1
"I bought this to wear with leggings while pregnant, and it does the job. I don't love the pattern; it seems more like a poorly tie dyed shirt in person, but for my purposes, it's okay. It seems a little more ""middle aged woman"" than trendy young mom, so I don't anticipate wearing it much once I'm not carrying a human inside me.",1
"Disclosure: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review. Overall, I really like this case/sleeve. I do not have a Macbook so I tried it with two different sized computers and they both fit so there is plenty of room. The zipper opens on three sides which allows the case to open completely and lay flat on the table. The inside is cushioned and provides protection for the device. I do love the color though it looks closer to royal than navy blue. One downside for me is that there is no handle or strap with which to carry the case. The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone. In addition, the case is a fairly slick material so it can slip out of your hand while carrying. It is waterproof (I tested it by putting a sheet of paper inside and holding it out in the rain; the paper remained dry) and has a roomy zippered pocket on the outside for carrying a mouse or ear buds or other items. Overall, I like this product. I won't get a chance to use it, however, as my son immediately took it for his school computer- a perfect fit.",1
These are very tiny. That's the only reason I give 4 stars. They are very strong. Good magnets,1
This works very well. Love that the cord is chew resistant and that you can set the temperature. I use this under our Golden Retriever's bed. She just had a litter of 8 puppies and this pad allows her to leave them without us worrying about them getting cold. 4 stars because I thought it would be bigger. Please note it isn't the size for a Golden Retriever.,1
"These are great and I absolutely love the look, but with any yarn product it will start to fray. I believe mine started within two weeks but I would buy again.",1
Product as described.,1
"This was a nice, light read. The characters are believable and enjoyable. I will read more books in this series.",1
"This are lovely, but ok only giving it four starts becouse I thought they were going to be a little bigger.",1
I am disappointed in the quality of this wallet. When you first look at it new it looks great but when it is used for a month it looks like it is years old. It does not have any torn places yet and no worn places but a little disappointed in the looks.,1
"Seems to fit more comfortably on my right foot than my left, but I like them a lot.",1
Chris Pratt stole this show and I thought I was going to hate it. It‚Äôs pretty good. Check it out.,1
"These are great if you have a small waist, narrow hips. They last much longer than the other briefs that Hanes makes.",1
Original equipment replacement. Bit of a pain to install but works well.,1
The pole is just so so and a bit weak at the joints but still very fun to play with for the price,1
Really nice quality. It fits both me and my friends.,1
"The telescope is good, but the USPS is too slow.",1
Product is as described.,1
I put this in my 2014 Ford F150 which the speakers were blown. I was expecting more bass which is mediocre at best. My 2010 ram 1500 has 5 times better bass than these speakers and they dodge is stock sound system. But for the price I guess is decant.,1
This squishy wasn‚Äôt too soft or slow rising but it smelled very good. It took about 3-4 seconds to rise.,1
This stopped working after a 3 week period of use. They refuse to refund the money so buyer beware. I worked great for a short period of time. This really is a failure. After this review I was contacted by the company and they resolved my problem in a timely manner. I now consider the company response very favorably.,1
"Really nice case. The only thing I don't like about it is the back side of the case as it does not wrap up around like my old case and presents a snagging potential. I have not had it happen yet, but it could.",1
nice set of strings. Didn't fit like I expected a short scale set to fit but I didn't measure them before I cut them to fit without excess. still a good buy.,1
"I purchased two of these for me and one of my friends to use while camping at a campsite with notoriously gross bathrooms over the summer. They worked well. However, you have to be careful because the funnel part will come off mid-pee if you push it up against you too hard, LOL.",1
"It has a nice feel and red color stripes. A little shorter then expected; therefore, I hanged dry instead of the dryer. Used the shirt for a pirate outfit.",1
"I love the phone case , but was quite confused when I opened it and it actually smelled like mint. Had several other people smell it thinking I lost my mind but nope, it actually smells like mint.",1
"Love the materials and look of the black with red piping seat covers. The fit is pretty good on my 2018 Honda Accord Sport after sitting in them for about a week. The headrest covers are a waste though. Didn‚Äôt use them. Needs a little more thought into the design and better coverage. Not a fan of the cheap gold badge near the top of the backrest, either. Manufacturer could save money by eliminating it. Just a few minor suggestions to a nice set of seat covers. 4 stars could be 5 with improvements.",1
"My 8yo daughter's hair is still baby-like, thin and fine and wont curl, but I'm also not all that great with doing hair so maybe it's me. This clip in thing was perfect for her hair! It matched perfectly and it was easy to do. All I did was pull her hair back in a bun and clipped it in. I used a few Bobby pins but it felt secure without it. She was so excited to show off her curly hair at the Daddy Daughter dance at school. She kept it on the whole time which surprised me because she is tender headed. She wore it again for picture day a few weeks later. After wearing it twice it's gotten frizzy and looks a bit messy but by reading other reviews I know to just wash and reset them. I've not done that yet because I want to read more and be sure of what I'm doing first. I will definitely buy more styles of clip ins for her since this worked so well!",1
Fun prank works really well,1
Wonderful for anyone who tends to drop things.,1
I actually didn‚Äôt order this for pet use! I‚Äôm working on a project for my daughter‚Äôs Halloween costume. I‚Äôm making her a fox tail and it called for combing yarn with a pet brush and then straightening with a hot iron. This brush is spectacular bc it brings up the tons and tons of yarn remains that would be a headache cleaning up! 2 thumbs up!,1
I came in the middle of the series but still enjoyed the story and characters.,1
"Scissors are great, pretty nicely built. Only drawback is the magnet thing doesn't hold anything heavy. Barely holds the shears.",1
"This is the first setup of this nature that I've ever purchased. My son wanted to start his own cooking channel on YouTube and we needed something to help us record the video and sound using an old Samsung Galaxy 7. I found this setup quick and to assemble. I took away a few stars on durability because I broke the microphone mount the 2nd time I used it. It was just too rigid to pop the mic in and out. I can still mount the mic which is nice, the mount is just broken in the middle. The case that it comes with is really convenient. I'd recommend this for anyone with a need for a mic and light set.",1
"Just a reminder that this connector only works one out put at a time. If you're looking to have duel output, you'll need to buy a powered unit that says it can handle that feature. Otherwise, works well.",1
My granddaughter loves bath bombs and these were no different. Packaged very well. All of the roses make a circle with a heart saying love in the middle .they fizz in the tub awhile which I like and the smell is very good left her skin feelin soft. A little expensive but most bath bombs are. They were comparable to the bath bombs I have bought at a pricey boutique all in all I was satisfied,1
All i have to do is pick it up and the dogs know that they need to be quiet.,1
"This is a pretty decent dvd shelf. It's a bit of a pain to install since it requires several tools. You need a screwdriver and a hammer to fit it together. Also, the shelves aren't wobbly at all, but I believe the included wall mount is required for stabilizing. All in all, this is a fine particle board shelf.",1
12/2 Update: After using this laptop bag for a couple of months the velco that holds the laptop in the laptop sleeve has come apart. I still love my bag. Thankfully it has a zipper closure. I love everything about this bag. How it hangs on my shoulder. How it fits my laptop and other items. It is just perfect. It came beautiful packaged! Kudos to the seller!,1
"It's been about a month since I have put it on my new phone. It's very pretty, design has not yet scratched off or fallen off; the clear material has NOT yellowed, and i like how it feels. It's very good quality and well worth the money. It comes with a phone stand that I dont really use but I do like it when I have used it. Good buy!",1
Good band for the money. Looks good but a little cheap in quality,1
"I loved the idea of this... But now that I have it, I'm kind of disappointed, it's closed up in a way that if your gecko (or other reptile) is in it, you can't access the animal... This is great for feeling secure, but if you need to take your animal out for any reason, you'll have to take the whole hide out and hope the gecko comes out in a timely manner... Other then that, I like the design and size, it's bigger then expected",1
Works great directions not too clear but we figured it out!,1
Someone recommended that I look at this sleeping pad after the one I was using developed a leak. I was a little apprehensive about all the claims but this pad fits the bill. It is lighter and rolls to a smaller size than my previous sleeping pad. It also inflates faster which is great after a long hike. The only reason I didn't give it all five stars is it is not as thick as I would like. It is still very comfortable but I could use a little more support in my lower back. I solve this problem by putting a rolled up T-shirt where I need it. This may only be my problem and it will not stop me from using this pad on future camping trips.,1
Exactly what I expected. They do the job.,1
Omg this book was absolutely amazing. This book was a page turner that I just couldn't stop reading until the end. I had absolutely loved reading this book. I would highly recommended this book.,1
This bolo tie is amazing! The first one I purchased and it goes so well with my style! I would definitely consider purchasing another bolo tie in the future,1
Kept water with no ice cold for 12 hours,1
"I like the remote-controlled car very much, and my daughter is happy to have something new to play with, just like any child. It was everything we expected, transportation and customer service exceeded our expectations. They are great! It could cross the grass or climb a hill. It's a good remote-control car. It's cool.",1
This are so cute. The fabric is nice. They have a liner inside (shorts). And the seams line up so well with the fabric being striped,1
Quick delivery and good product,1
"What an amazing product. The keys feel so fresh, the colors are crisp. When you download the software to alter the colors (software is super, super easy to use,) I HIGHLY recommend the Keystroke Wave. It does a ripple affect across the entire keyboard after a keystroke of random and/or specific colors. Love it!",1
"Went together in no time, very solid.",1
The product came and working very well,1
This speaker is very impressive!! It may be small but it puts out very loud and clear sound! The volume on my phone was all the way up so when I started playing the music it scared me because it was so loud. I was immediately impressed with how loud and clear this mini speaker is. Everyone needs to have one of these!,1
Each chapter stands apart from the others allowing a subject's history to be understood in depth. Well written and informative.,1
"Very pleased with this bed frame, easy set up and beautiful",1
"I bought two of these for my grand babies..I love this.. It is colorful , makes music, and moves and is very entertaining..... Great choice",1
"I bought this for my nieces first birthday and my daughters 2nd birthday. And it‚Äôs a hit! Especially since we live in FL, we can practically use it year round. My daughter goes in it every time we go outside. She absolutely loves it.",1
"We were looking for grinder for deer and elk meat to make into ground meat..this grinder works perfectly. It is noisy (as expected), but overall does a great job!",1
Great for space saving. I bought these to store our extra comforter bed sets and blankets and I‚Äôve used 2 large bags and one medium and I‚Äôve been able to fit 2 comforter sets and sheet and most of our blankets in them.,1
Works like it should,1
"This is a knock-off of the ""Tantra"" chair I've been dying to try. However, with the original at almost $500, I didn't see getting one any time soon. So when I saw this one, at less than 1/2 the price, I ordered it on the spot. Shipping is a little slow, but it should be here any day and I can't wait to give my bf the other half of his birthday gift ( the other present I got him was a yoga swing. We will be working out, but it will have little to do with yoga !!! Lol, can't wait !",1
I love these lashes for daily wear or photo shoots.,1
I had no problems with this product and would recommend it to friends and family,1
"Excellent product! As advertised and noted in so many of the positive reviews. Well made, sturdy, with no noticeable defects or problems. I bought three of these to use with my new TV and all perform perfectly. If and when i need more products of this type I will definitely purchase from them again! It's nice to be a happy camper!",1
So cute & easy to put together,1
"I'm using this File Folder in my office at home, I like the different colors and that it has 12 pocket expanding file folder. It helps to organize all my papers.",1
Great price and fast shipping,1
Grand daughter loved it!,1
really useful device works great,1
"This has been a huge hit for my sales team. It‚Äôs taken our customer engagement events to another level. It‚Äôs built well, sturdy, and easy to use. Super pleased with the purchase.",1
Master chefs creating products that last and must be stocked in any real pantry,1
"This looks exactly like my real LV bag, it matches perfectly. Even around the seams, the pattern matches correctly. This holds my passport and credit cards. I love that it's RFID blocking, there's so much fraud that goes on, especially at airports that we don't realize so having RFID blocking is a massive plus. It's also lightweight, was delivered fast, there are no strong smells. I'm going to see what other products of this style this seller has!",1
The quality of of these are amazing. They have a heavy feel and seem more expensive then they really are.,1
Cute and comfortable compression socks. My calves measure 19.5 inches.,1
Like the round package as fits nicely everywhere and handy in car. More expensive but worth it.,1
Everything was as stated. Recommend for anyone who needs more bands for there Apple Watch.,1
"I wanted something simple for my home office. This has adjustable light settings via touch, and a USB port to conveniently charge phones, etc. It doesn't take up much space on a desk and looks great.",1
Please get more of this water. Every time I order out of stock,1
"I love this charger. I purchased one for myself, then one for my husband, the two more for my daughters.",1
Exactly what it says.,1
"My guests loved the personalized keychain, it came with the bags which made them very presentable. The keychain is functional being a bottle opener too.",1
I like this toothpaste a lot.,1
Fast shipping and great price!,1
Very Nice and large bag exactly what we need to store our christmas tree in for the off season,1
I am quite pleased with my elephant coin purse. It works for me! It is absolutely gorgeous. I love elephants.,1
We broke the original cup holders on our camp chairs and needed replacements. These cup holders were perfect replacements and are better than the originals.,1
I use these to mail small products I sell love them!,1
Made a high difference on my metal table.,1
These are quickly becoming one of my favorite pencils. I absolutely love all of the beautiful colors. I have many different sets of pencils and these have such a nice variety of different colors that aren't in other sets that I own. I would definitely buy again. Great addition to my colored pencil collection.,1
11 and 13 are some of my favorite movies. 12 not so much,1
"The banner I pinned, pom poms were pulled out carefully and ballons came out great! Some of the clear one with stars were okay, some stayed up and the other deflated. Still very cute and great for the price.",1
"I'm going to first be honest in saying I was VERY skeptical of a glass file having the ability to shine my nails, without damaging them. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I first used one. No damage to my nails, and a perfect shine to them! I love that this file is dual purpose, and small enough to fit in my purse, or zippered wallet for quick on the go carrying.",1
"I came to depend on wireless chargers from when I had an iPhone 8. Unfortunately, my charger was not compatible with my new phone (11 model). This one from Anker is a different company, but it works just as well. The charging is quick and it works with the phone's leather style case. I wasn't sure if I would get another wireless charger but a couple of weeks plugging and unplugging quickly changed my mind. And for the relatively low price, this one is a great deal.",1
"I purchased this drawstring backpack as I make frequent trips to the beach to go swimming or surfing. Thus far I have been very impressed. It was packaged very compactly and appears to fold down easily for storage or travel purposes. It appears significantly higher quality than your regular run-of-the-mill drawstring as the straps are firmly attached and will not untie like regular ones do - further they have buckles for length and comfort adjustment. The size capacity also appears to be very generous - I am easily able to fit a towel as well as other beach items inside without issue. The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items. The zipper straps are also very colorful and of a well-suited color scheme. If I were to lose this bag I would definitely choose to purchase it again, as it has performed its duty well thus far. Will update this review if anything changes but it seems like it will hold up well to usage and the weather!",1
The storage is some big and lid works well. Can get a lot in them. Was worth the money. Thank you.,1
Have patience putting it on! Love the flower pattern.,1
"Always a good (and sometimes required) investment for expensive tech. I always try to use a surge protector on all my tech so nothing happens to it. I would recommend against using this outside as it is not a sealed unit. It is also great to use to save money on your electricity bill, you are able to turn everything off at once. I do with the outlets were more separated so you can fit multiple blocks beside each other and not have to waste an outlet.",1
"This product is exactly what I was looking for. It is very easy to set up, the product is durable and works perfectly. It delivers a smooth adjustable jet of water and the brass rain bird has a quality feel to it. I get good coverage with one sprinkler but will probably need one more for 100% coverage due to a large roof area. This sprinkler gives me a good feeling knowing that there is something on my roof that could help in the event of a fire. My house is located in a forest setting. I have it attached to a 50' stainless steel hose that runs down the backside of the house with the other end of the hose attached directly to a side faucet. Makes for turning water on and off easy. Should last for many years. At first I thought it to be a bit pricy but after seeing how easy and secure it is to set up and how well it preforms, it is worth the cost. Recommended!",1
"Great product, very happy with it. Size M fits great (L was too loose) with 32‚Äù waist 42‚Äù chest.",1
Love the ability to make this deeper as needed.,1
"Great rackets for the price. We been using it for a few weeks, still in pretty good shape. light weight compare with other beginner level rackets, came with a decent carrier too",1
This is an awesome outdoor light that added so much character to my maple tree I have in my front yard. I have so many color options and they all look elegant,1
By partner loves them..... he said ur took him back to his childhood..... you should have seen him on Christmas day when he opend the box... smile from ear to ear..... hope it does the same to whom ever you......i give it to.,1
"Charged my iPhone XS and series 3 watch without issues, even when charging both devices at the same time. W",1

Thanks that was fast and fits great.,1
Great! Just as described.,1
"In high school I had an Adidas bag for club soccer that was this style. Being that I didn't know this brand I was skeptical but this bag is even better than my Adidas. The zippers are good quality and the backpack straps are EXCELLENT. Way more comfortable than my previous bag. Highly recommended. The inside zipper pocket is great for keys and headphones for the gym, the shoe pockets are great (size 10 sneaks fits good). Outside mesh pocket is usually meant for a soccer ball, but i use it for damp clothes after swimming etc. For $23, just buy it.",1
"Purchased this for my dad, who has some vision issues. He's 82 and prefers a large print calendar. This calendar can be seen from a distance and has plenty of space to write your appointments in. He really likes it.",1

Very clean looking and soft to the touch. I love it,1
Hard to properly lay it and squeeze out the air bubbles at the same time ... hopefully it stays in tack if not there‚Äôs two more in the pack that I can use I guess,1
Gorgeous and textured. If you get a bump or tiny hole it almost looks more realistic,1

This is a solid comb. It's perfect for my mustache and it fits nicely in my pocket.,1
"I was skeptical at first but these headphones are pretty good for the price. When I put these headphones in they block out all of the outside noise. Sound quality in my opinion is great. The only complaint I have is the part of the headphones that wrap around your ears are pretty flimsy. But other than that these are really good, and I would definitely recommend these before you decide to spend over a $100 for some beats",1
Very effective with knee replacement surgery,1
"Nothing to say here, they're metal plates with adhesive on the back.",1
My new EDC! I will never leave home without it and getting my wife one,1

Omg these earbuds are incredible . Totally worth it,1

In a society where we have to deal with worrying about what's going to happen with our disposed of syringes and medications this is absolutely Superior. Was able to lock it down until it was needed to be emptied. At which time I called for someone to dispose of all my stuff and everything was complimented on the quality and craftsmanship of this lockdown box for sharps. Couldn't be happier,1

"Ankle was injured while running. Bought this to aid in healing faster (R.I.C.E.). I‚Äôd recommend placing the ice packs in the brace & freezing because if you freeze prior, it becomes tricky to place them in the pockets. It is comfortable to wear vs. consistently bandaging/compressing the injury.",1
Works perfect. Fast shipment and reasonably priced,1

These are really great diving gloves. They allow for free movement compared to other gloves I've used in the past.,1

For the price this is the best paper. I love painting on this Very good product.,1
The hubby was very pleased with how solid this unit is. We use Otter Box cases for our phones and it definitely reminded us of the quality and protection that Otter Box provides. A fantastic price for this much storage in a heavy duty case.,1
"Loved this sleep mask. I have used lots of different sleep masks in the past, and this by far has been my favorite. Its adjustable , soft and keeps all the light out. I like the eye pads are concave so it's not resting right on your eyes.",1
My nephew loved these.,1
"If you are looking for some extension bit for your screwdriver, check this one out. I am expecting an extension bid holder for a while. And this one is new to me. Flexible! That means you can bend it to fit your needs. I gonna love it.",1
Worked well for the money!,1
"This works as promised - easy to use up and down curbs and stairs, stable over cracks in pavement, can leave something standing and not worry about it tipping over. Well worth the price.",1
Got this for my daughter. She loves it.,1

Old fashioned quality!,1
This thing is awesome!!!,1
"Had a huge impact on my hip and lower back pain as well as improved sleeping. It is a little uncomfortable at first but so it standing correctly. Mostly it is the straps cutting in under your arms. It also tends to ride up your belly and has to be pulled back down a few times a day. Sti, the pain relief was better than yoga, chiropractic adjustments and diet changes. I am really surprised how much it helped. Good luck",1

The light arrived quickly and was well packaged. It was very easy to install and is very sleek looking. It really lights up my dark inside hallway.,1

Works great for my Smoke Hollow.,1
"I actually paid almost the double of the price for an extra charger on a store that the prices are at the lowest. The value and the quality of this one is equal and much more affordable. Actually, this one seems a little better quality charger because it seems to not be overheating as the one I got at a regular store. It‚Äôs much lighter as well. I highly recommend to have extra chargers because we never know what could happen in only having one. It‚Äôs a necessary item and it‚Äôs important to have a quality one. I‚Äôm very satisfied with this charger, it charges fairly quickly as well, it‚Äôs a big plus in my opinion.",1
Perfect for my daughter! Arch support alleviated foot pain. She needs arch support and these are the only flip flops I have found that she can wear all day with no pain! Support yet cushioned,1

Works fine. Was able to attach a holiday nightlight that had a broken switch to it. Happy I was able to salvage it!,1

"Spill proof, nice color and easy to clean. Perfect cup for summer drinks. These are better than most stainless steel cups because the screw lid makes it spill proof. I lovd that the lid opening is a flip top and big enough for a straw",1
"My boyfriend got me this starter set for my birthday. I‚Äôve been doing my nails so often since. I use every bit of this kit. Gelish is a great brand and I‚Äôll stay loyal to their products. The only thing I wouldn‚Äôt repurchase in this kit is the led lamp. It is so small. I‚Äôm going to go for an auto on/off and one that I can fit both hands into at once. Other than the small lamp, this kit rocks.",1
"This was so easy to use, and made it so much easier to clean my kids ears at night. No more digging with a qtip or tweezers, this is so much simpler. The kids didn't mind this at all, which means instead of holding them down and fighting to get it done they just sat there, which cut the time down tremendously.",1
I am very happy with this purchase.,1
"These are 100% true halogen bulbs, and far cheaper than paying $7.99 for one bulb at the local hardware store. Needing three bulbs, I'm way ahead of the curve on saving, along with have 7 bulbs to spare.",1
Goes with many things. Good quality - I love it,1
It is an excellent portfolio for the price.,1
This is far the best product i have ever purchased. I highly recommend it.,1
"These grips are a lifesaver for magic mice. They make it so much more comfortable to hold and move around if you're like me and have your pinky hanging off the right hand edge. They're sized perfectly and don't obstruct the movement of the mouse, although the rubbery finish collects dirt really easily so I end up wiping them down pretty regularly.",1
Works as intended. It is nice to finally have a step latter that can be used all over the house! I‚Äôm,1
Very creamy and moisturizing but not oily. It works like a primer and gives smooth texture which makes it easy to apply foundation!!,1
this has helped my husbands gums a lot,1
This is an amazing product! Very portable and ready to use in a minute... I use it in a daily basis and saves a lot of time compared to traditional iron ...Goodbye wrinkles ;),1
I bought these chocolates for the tin. Lol. The chocolates are yummy!,1
I installed this on my Whirlpool washer and it worked as expected,1
"Installed on December 11th, it's now February 26th ... this product has exceeded my expectations. The solar panel gets approximately 6 hours of sun daily, the lights come on at dusk, and run for a good 11 hours until dawn.",1
"Really like it, keeps my food cold use it every day.",1
It seems to reduce my white fingers.,1
"I love the healthy and natural ingredients in this food. I've tried several brands and this is the only brand that has a low reasonable price AND has all healthy ingredients I can pronounce! I'm a very picky, healthy conscious cat mom, my babies come running when it's time to eat. I also love that one bag feeds both cats and kittens. The ONLY brand I've found that does. I have 2 cats and 1 kitten and I foster for the local Humane Society and it's expensive to buy 2 different bags of food when we all know they eat both food anyways when you're not looking.",1
Lovett! Ordered earrings for my daughter. Just what she was looking for. A great gift for the holidays.,1
I needed this for a class but ended up keeping it because there is so much great info in it!,1
Each book continued where the other left off. You can't just stop at 1. It's so spellbinding that you have to continue to find out what happens next.,1
"Best described as historical fiction, although not in the romantic sense, this novel is exceedingly well written. I was pulled into Charles' life from the first page. I loved the development of the character, Charles, and his alter ego Bulldog. I did not find the story dull or slow moving, as the critical reviewers did - the pace was just right for me. The writing is an integral part of the story, as Charles is an aspiring reporter. Entertaining and immersive, there is also some suspense and tension as Charles becomes involved with not one but 2 crime families on his way to realizing his dream.",1
"Plates arrived packaged well. No chips or cracks and the printing on the plates is done well, no flaws or messed up printing. With some plate holders these made awesome displays for my wife's rooster country kitchen",1
"Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase! I agree with what some others said about the band not being at all adjustable. In fact, I generally just rest it on top of my eyes as it can be a bit tight. However, despite that minor issue, it has really helped my dry eye syndrome and my sinuses, as a bonus as well. I've been using it twice daily.",1
"I was hesitant to buy these since the ratio of the number of brushes to the price seemed too good to be true. I've only used E.L.F makeup brushes in the past but some of the brushes in this set here actually surpassed the quality of E.L.F's (at least for me). These are pretty decent brushes, especially for beginners or for people on a budget. The only brush out of the set I did not really like was the fan brush, but that was not a deal-breaker for me. They are very soft and did not shed like cheaper brushes tend to. I highly recommend these for anyone wanting to start messing around with makeup and eyeshadows or people who do not want to spend a crazy amount of money for makeup brushes.",1
My kids use this and it works as promised!,1
came well packaged and fits perfectly in my lunch bag. They don't take up much room in the fridge as they are small and stackable,1
Seriously sad to think this could be the last I read of the Almighty Ford and his buddy Mike. Fantastic work. You won‚Äôt be disappointed.,1
Will buying again love this gaming tv it perfect,1
The rocks were a good variety and were quickly delivered,1
Loved colors and feel of them.,1
"I purchased 2 packages of Non-Scratch HEAVY DUTY Scouring Pad or Pot Scrubber Pads and they work well with my Bar Tenders soap or with regular dish washing liquid. They do not scratch and work on many different surfaces. Well priced, i highly recommend them.",1
Well made item. Great results.,1
Works great using it for computer stand,1
"My daughter has been begging me for these glasses forever so I finally ordered them for her and she LOVES them... I do too! They are so cute and great quality. I thought they were gonna be cheaply made, but they are not! I recommend these! Very stylish! My other daughters boyfriend is even ordering a pair for himself...",1
"love these. they are a bit small even though i sized up, but otherwise great slippers",1
"Take that strict managers that go beyond the store's dress policy. Pretty sure the customer's aren't looking at my white socks and black shoes when they come into the store, but here you go. Otherwise, these socks are sooo comfortable and hopefully are wash friendly (haven't seen yet, but will update). For the price, it's totally worth it and I love how the toes and the heel have different colors! Haven't had any trouble with them slipping off because they fit perfectly~",1
"Awesome product, perfect fit, keeps the dash protected and the car cool",1
Third time I've bought. Perfect,1
"This is EXACTLY what I wanted. I was talked into a hardshell case when I bought the phone, and it was extremely priced and totally inconvenient. This case is perfect for my use. Precision cutouts for mic, cam, and charger. Feels great, has space inside for cards or currency, Nicely stitched. Magnet keeps it closed in pocket or purse, flips out easily in less than a second to answer phone or take a photo. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this case!",1
Just what I was looking for. Warm and fits well.,1
Worked great had lots of overspray and now all gone,1
My husband is unsteady and this cup holder Keeps his drink stable. He is more confident to have his drink no matter where we are?,1
One of my fave things about KIND bars is the reduced sugar. I love this one because it‚Äôs one of the few chocolate flavored bars that doesn‚Äôt have peanuts in the ingredients.,1
"Great value and sound, makes my old Land Cruiser sound great!!",1
This is a great product Ive used for 20 years. It‚Äôs not for those who are sensitive to rough wash cloths. This product is great for exfoliating leaving you with clean-feeling skin.,1
Very stylish and great quality product. Highly recommend this product,1
Feels so good on my lips. I keep one in almost every room.,1
We discovered Murray Mints while traveling in England many years ago and very much liked them. They don‚Äôt have a strong mint flavor but I would describe the flavor as being a creamy light mint. We both would recommend them.,1
Love frogger. Purchase came quick and in perfect condition,1
"Very cute book, my grandson who is being potty trained enjoys me reading it to him. Brightly colored and cute illustrations. I have bought other books from this author as well and was not disappointed.",1
Quality mats and easy to keep clean. Replaced bulky old blue tri-fold gym mat - simple to roll up and store or just leave out in basement and also in bedroom. Very supportive and looks nice!,1
Enjoying the variety of sizes. Used many times building tables out of 2x4s.,1
I attached it to the book and it lit up the hole paperback book. Tried it on a hardback book and used both lights and it lit up the book. Great light.,1
I liked the block but the con is the plastic clip should be made stronger .. it can crack when product is used hard as it is with my grandchild.,1
This item is super cute. The spaces are wide and deep enough to hold all of my remotes.,1
This fit just right im so glad I can recline again lol. this was easy to install as well.,1
Best car seat ever! We‚Äôll all chicco products are. The convertible function is a plus!,1
Pleased with healthy Packers ability to keep my lunch and drink nice and cold especially during our current heat wave. Was using a popular competitors product but it was unable to do the job like Healthy Packers.,1
Bought the whole line. Love it!,1
They are small but mine work just as they're supposed to. I let mine charge for 3 days at a window while they were off then put them out and they worked all night in one of the flashing modes.,1
Very sturdy and does the job keeping the dogs out!,1
Good blatter for well,1
PERFECT! It's the most used skillet in the house.,1
Not much to say about a connector - works well and I would purchase again.,1
Price shipping on time and my personal use,1
I loved loved the color and material of the cosmetic bag. It fit perfectly into my backpack for travel.,1
These are fantastic. I use them with my Medela pump. No issues. Thank you very much to the people who make these because it was not even worth the bother to pump with the smallest size that Medela made. Now with these I can pump effectively.,1
I can safely say this has done what it says to do...have been down and out about myself for gaining weight and using weight loss products has helped me to lose some weight in the past couple weeks. Starting to feel better about myself.,1
It works and its a large size not tiny,1
Works very well was able to video complete softball game.,1

New mattress deserved a new pad/cover. It is soft and comfortable and fit our king size mattress perfectly.,1

"I love these earrings! They are subtle and adorable. I was surprised how well made they are and they come with multiple kinds of backs to the them, which is helpful for different kinds of ears. I bought these on Prime Day, and the color I wanted sold out, but I still love the purple pearl. It is a good color to compliment silver.",1
Works great! Easy to use and fast. Huge game changer for packaging cookies in my home bakery!,1
really nice for the price. you must be prepared to take the time to shape the branches. It's well worth the time!,1
I've always loved this song. I've been singing it to my children since they were born.,1
Very nice stand. It works perfectly for keeping cats away from my indoor plant. Easy to assemble and looks good as well.,1
good quick heating up to temp.,1
It was easier to install this product then to drill the pop rivets out of the original part. I was repairing an old self propelled Toro for my dad that let it sit for 4 years and broke the pull start trying to get it running again. So alot of pulling on this to get it all ready for him.,1
Crow is a many faceted main character who deserves the depth of love he finds with Ethan. Their love sparkles with well written reality. So far the best of the Sierra series.,1
"This organizer fits perfectly into my LV Neverfull MM. The color is not a perfect match to the pale pink lining of the bag. It is a brighter pink, but that doesn‚Äôt really matter too much to me. Overall, I‚Äôm very happy with it.",1
They are a little long but otherwise fit well and are comfortable,1
I love this product. I use it for restless leg syndrome and it works for me. I also use it for black and blue bruises.,1

So cute! As described,1
I have purchased this set for my niece- cannot wait to give to her! What I like the most that is not going to make any mess- water based product! Definitely recommend since you can always take it with you while you are traveling with a kid! Easy to care with you everywhere.,1
Last longer for cutting,1
I'm always on the road and I've been im an accident and had a hard time to proof I wasn't at fault before but now I have this camera so if anything ever happens now I'll have my own evidence right away on hand. The video quality amazing with this 4k. The material is great it looks it will withstand falls and drops if anything. The setup and to review and adjust settings is so easy.,1
"I bought this wreath for the Holidays and love it so much that I'm keeping it up indefinitely. I put it on my front glass door and I'm enjoying it from the outside and inside. At first glance, I thought, ""I can make this. But I don't have the time."" Well, now that I have purchased this wreath, I realize it was beyond my ""art and craft"" abilities. Lots of interwoven berries. Plus, it has a cord that can be used to hang on a hanger (must purchase the hanger separately). The cord does need to be adjusted so as not to pull on the round shape of the wreath. You can see that a bit in the picture, but easily adjusted.",1
This item was so awesome. We used it for when we went to Disney. We got about 8 full charges out of one battery. Takes awhile to charge so I did that at nighttime. I bought 2 of these. Slightly heavy but we carried backpacks so we were good. I would also suggest buying a case to put your battery in. Protects it and also will hold any extra cords or accessories. Definitely recommend!,1
My great niece loves this book. Thank you.,1
this is the second one I have bought. love it.,1
"This is a great backpack. The only draw back is the hook & loop panels inside aren't as large as I'd like them to be. Good design and very comfortable. No waste/hip belt, but if you're carrying enough weight that you need one than you should just use a larger pack. Plenty of room for my gear. Stitching is lighter than I'd like, but this was designed to look like a civilian/school pack.",1
An excellent product for me,1
"Car wireless charger, it is fashionable. I am a newly bought Apple iphone X, I need a wireless charging on the car, this phone charger is just excellent. It is a phone holder and also a wireless charger. Very good.",1
I am very pleased with the hangers. They are better than I expected.,1
This was a wonderful book. Such amazing people doing an amazing rescue. Couldn‚Äôt put it down.,1
For keto cuisine its fantastic. For everyone Its high quality is wonderful.,1
choose for easy to locate color,1
Very good kit for me to trim my nails. I always carry a kit of clippers. Last one I've got broke and found this one by chance. Very good quality for the price!,1
Top book! Worth a read,1
it is original product,1
I no longer need a tv and a bluray player as my pc can now fill all the needs those were used for.,1
"I really enjoy getting this orange juice. I am a diabetic so the no sugar added is very important. Also, I don‚Äôt have any waste, since it‚Äôs in a can instead of a big bottle that would go bad and have to be thrown away.",1
"Very nicely made, good quality. It looks great and is holding up well.",1
The phone case is very popular and the color is very beautiful. It feels good.,1
"The best cleaning set for my kids ,even my son was playing with it .really fun for them ,brushing the floor ,watering the flowers and so on...a good motive to teach them to help you around the house.",1
"Cute shirt fit as expected, doesn't feel like a cheap shirt",1
Awesome product and price!,1
"This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around. What I like about this device is that Selfie don't need to raise your hand far just to get a good picture and struggle pressing that button for the camera. Another thing about this device is that it comes with an extra holder to the bluetooth clicker and you either put it on the stick or your finger, but it is better to put it on the stick for a long range selfie. Another thing i notice about this Universal Wireless bluetooth Camera is that the plus (+) and the minus (-) sign can also work to take a picture. I think it is serve to zoom in zoom out but for my S8 it works as to take a snap shot picture. Design it look sleek and doesn't look cheap to look at. When it comes to emergency photo with a group good to have it around.",1
Nala Love's her flip stick it is a great interactive toy . She gets so excited when we get it out to play. She gets a ton of exercise while playing. I would definitely recommend,1
Works great!! You have to remember to wear them! Ha ha ha!! Always forgetting them!,1
My friends and I wanted to try it out. Nothing happened but it‚Äôs still scared us lol.,1
Amazing toys she loved them,1

I grew up with Sees Candy. My Gram worked for them in quality control. She would have been pleased with how well my candy looked when it arrived. Perfect!,1
"I like this Wall Clock as the color is stylish and interesting and it is indeed non-tickling one so it is very quiet. For a noise-sensitive person like me, I can sleep well at night while the clock keeps working on the wall in my master bedroom. The only drawback for this clock I experienced was it was pretty hard for me to install a new AA battery in the back of it at the beginning, but it was not a major issue though. I hope the battery can last long enough to compensate the non-tickling technology that is the main feature of this wall clock. I suggest that the manufacturer smoothen the battery place in the back of the clock so that customers can install a new AA battery easily.",1
"Gave to my son for his birthday, he loves it.",1
"Great quality! Love this bag, perfect size for a person on the go.",1
My sister in law loved the decor and this added that special little touch any expecting mama deserves!,1
I love this desk! It is sturdy and offers me plenty of space. Love the color. It is not a real wood top and the top comes in two pieces but it works for me. It is responsive to the up/down motion. Definitely worth the money so far for being in this price range. I will update this if anything changes.,1
Gifted and they are very happy with this.,1
"I just received the package and even with the box beaten up the ink was contained within the cartridges and not all over them like some of the other reviews. I have run a test print and it looks great! If the ink lasts almost or as long as the HP ones, these are a no brainer for the price!",1

"The first one I purchased is actually in Japan. I had a very good experience of using it. Not too big, not too small, just the right size. It can keep water warm for a very long time, the edge of the cup mouth is smooth and clean. I lost the first one in one trip and come to get this as the second one, it is just as good as the first one.",1
Worked better than the original.,1

These are really nice straps. Great material and well made. They‚Äôre very comfy and look durable. I like that you don‚Äôt have to wrap the straps around the bar so they‚Äôre super quick to use. They support the wrists nicely and the metal wedge at the end of the strap prevents slipping. Really happy with my purchase.,1
Great football for teaching the little ones how to catch. Don‚Äôt have to worry about them getting hurt or hit in the face when catching cause this is extremely soft. My kids love it and they are able to grip it because its squishy.,1
"Fun things to try is put a lemon slice in the ball ice mold and add water, then you can enjoy lemon water later",1

"As soon as I got it, I put it together ( the handle portion of it. Washed it with soap and water or course. and diced my tomatoes, onions, cilantro, chiles. the only thing I did not diced was my garlic. With that said I made salsa in about fifteen minutes, which it would have taken me an hour or so to hand dice everything. and the amount that I did was a substantial amount. I love it and I even took a picture of my dicer and the salsa that I made and I had 23 responses indicating that the salsa looked great and where did I get the dicer. Love it and will use it quite often",1
It's like a microwave 2.0 I use this a lot. Awesome for tofu! No seasoning needed and makes it crispy.,1

Both my kids love these. Used all summer and still functioning.,1
"This is an excellent resource for people who: 1) are not afraid to move forward in the fulfillment of their God-given destiny; and, 2) desire to positively impact their sphere of influence. I had the privilege of meeting the late Dr. Myles Munroe many, many years ago, and it was his writings on potential and Kingdom living that revolutionized my life. The vision that Dr. Munroe had will forever make a mark, that can not be erased, upon the lives of those who are hungry for purpose. I highly recommend ‚ÄúThe Principles and Power of Vision...‚Äù",1

This is the perfect co worker. She doesn‚Äôt back talk or ask for raises!! Yet at the same time she shows amazing on live videos. She is a little too quiet but again my viewers just love her appearance when she shows my bling! I might try letting her have some coffee to see if she talks a little more. But other than that she is Amazing and totally worth having around!!,1
Great book! When i finished all i could think was WOW!,1
This game feels real and it is very scary. I got so scared I quit the game I found like 6 ghosts in 1 room.,1

This is such a cute dress!!! I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs from Amazon. Only thing is that the clasps than hold the straps from sliding broke in the wash. I was able to pin them. You get what you pay for and at this price it‚Äôs worth it even if you only get a few wears out of it,1
"Light was installed, and tried a few days, I really like it, the elders of the family like it too, said that is energy saving and environment friendly.",1

I'm very pleased with the fullness of the slip and especially the hoop. It holds my dress to the perfect shape.,1
Extremely nice cover for my Dad's large smoker. He paid much more when he bought the grill and it covered less which leaves it too open to elements. This fits like a glove and was a much better price. Honestly this fabric is much thicker fabric than the one he purchased with the smoker so I think will last much longer.I am thrilled with the purchase!,1
I watched the Netflix episodes that were developed by the author. Her book captures all that information and more. There are numerous recipes with lots of helpful background information and tips which helped me find more satisfaction with my own cooking. I love this book!!!!,1

"The headphones arrived in good time as expected and have worked perfectly so far. The sound quality is very impressive and I appear to be lucky in that they stay on well and are comfortable when I am in the gym working hard on equipment and getting very hot. They didn't disappoint, they are so comfortable that if it wasn't for the music you could easily forget you were wearing them. Although they're not the best sounding headphone I own they are better than I expected for the price and more than adequate for a run.",1
Really good information! All you would need starting out with oils.,1

I left a review for this before when I wasn't really using it correctly but now that I am I really love it! I bought another one because I liked it so much and makes applying my BB cream even easier. I know usually BB cream doesn't need to be applied with one of these but it actually does make it look much nicer for me. I‚Äôm definitely recommend this.,1
"The fire works are back!! At a certain age, your perineal muscles get a bit lax. Being with my husband was becoming more frustrating than ecstatic, if you know what I mean.

The only thing is that its is not cordless but I never have a need to move around while I use the massage belt so it is not an issue with me but the price is a lot lower than the cordless models.",1

We have tried putting different kinds of food inside the bags and the bags worked really well, no leakage or tear or anything. At first it might be hard to close or open the bags, but it shows how tight the bags really are. Great product! Very satisfied! No more single use ziplock for us!",1

I love these! They are cozy and warm.,1

They do what they are supposed to do!,1
Replaced my dead battery. Need one day to charge. Works great,1
"My dog loves the bed. It's more comfortable than the floor on his old bones. It was EASY, EASY, EASY to assemble. I ordered a medium-sized but a small would have suited his sturdy 18 lbs, and taken up less space in the room.",1

"I like this air fryer a lot. It's so easy to use, to clean and fast to make any simple yet delicious dishes. Our favorite dish using this air fryer is chicken wings. It came out with crispy skins and juicy meat. I had another air fryer bought from best buy before and that one was cheaply made. It lasted for only 2 months.

Worked like a charm! Installed easily and without any problems.,1
I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this product. I purchased it before rescuing my puppy and she has never known any other way of travel. She loves it. She jumps in her tube and it just relaxes. I‚Äôve had it for almost a year and there has been absolutely no sign that a dog has been in my car other than a little bit of dust here and there. It‚Äôs really simple to install and take out so you can use it in multiple vehicles as well.,1
The Mrs. and I decided to redo our light fixtures and we wanted dimmable vintage style lights. These were much cheaper than the local Home Depot / Lowes etc so I was a little wary of the quality and look. We needed 24 just for one light fixture so this was a much better value for the price - they also look just as good as the others we purchases from home depot to compare from the more major brands. Very happy - cannot speak of their longevity at the moment as they've only been up a month but no burn outs or non functioning lights at all.,1
"I sent it as a gift to friends over Christmas. Our friends loved it. The only mishap, they didn't know who sent it. The Gift slip never reached them. However, they liked it so much they finished it before I enquired.",1

"I purchased a set of Pioneer Headphones not too long ago, on sale for $80. They did not produce the high fidelity sound I expected, which was disappointing from Pioneer. I was worried that the sound quality was indicative of Bluetooth over the ear headphones, so I returned them. Saw these reviewed as a Beats killer thought I would try them out. I have never used Beats, other than in the big box stores, so I cant really judge that review but these sure did blow the Pioneer set away. Much better bass and all around fidelity. They are smaller, which worried me, but the cups can tilt which allow them to fit nicely. They are comfortably snug and don't make me sweat. Get you some of these, they will not disappoint!",1
I bought the 18 lb weighted blanket and I love it! Haven't slept a day without since I got it over a month ago. I have anxiety and it helps me fall asleep much quicker at night.,1
Basic rubber flip flop. Good for beach or around the house.,1

very firm and comfortable ..it has two valves one for blowing air in and one for letting the air out.,1
My 8 lb Yorkie is totally rocking these PJs. Nice fabric. There isn't any snaps or Velcro. It just slipped over his head easily and the sleeves and legs were easy to put him into. I highly recommend buying these adorable pjs,1

Amazing product and the color of the pigment is wonderful.,1

He's a coonhound and has a very active brain. I use cheez whiz or peanut butter for him. It keeps him thinking so he doesn't become bored and destructive. I have two for him.,1
Using these for board-game bits!,1
The storyline was great! Loved it! I highly recommend this book. Spoiler.....I thought Kelsey was really going to end up alone.,1

My 2 year old can do all of these cards. They hold up well and we purchased the other sets after buying this one. Great learning tool for young kids!,1
I love Earl Grey tea and this one does not disappoint. It's a nice big tin; great value. I highly recommend.,1
Very happy with this Tahini. Not bitter. Color is a little darker than I expected but who cares. It's delicious. Note this is Tahini made with the sesame hulls not removed and that's why I ordered it and believe is the reason it's darker in color. Most Tahini is made with the hulls removed. This Tahini is thicker but very smooth. I will be ordering more.,1
I love listening to Walker Hayes!! He is one of my favorite singers!!,1
Scent doesn't last long,1
This worked as well as expected some parts even more so. Like the water resistant part ... We jump off a cliff into the ocean and still no water got through!,1
I‚Äôve always liked these for making decals reusable.,1
I had to secure shelving for 4 huge reel to reel tape decks in my wooden stereo entertainment system. The little metal dows would not hold the old very heavy tape units by themselves. So I needed additional wood braces to hold up the heavy tape decks. These slim nails worked great at securing wood slats under the shelves to add support to the shelving systems. The nails remained straight and true during hammering.,1
It worked well for us.,1
"Very well made, good quality, quick service,my customers love the look ,feel and colors",1

"I got this to do shoulder stretches, holding the cable with both hands and stretching my arms out to the side. It proved to long to do this holding it by the handles.

Took an hour and half to install.,1
"I use Quick Detailer every night when I get home.... keeps my car looking brand new, every day!",1
"As another reviewer wrote, this story broke my heart. The tragic lives of these two women unnerved me, made me angry and unbearably sad, yet I couldn‚Äôt stop reading. I had to know them, bear witness to their stories, share their suffering and hope for reunion and a chance at a better life. This story was so beautifully written, I couldn‚Äôt turn away.",1
Fits the bottle perfectly. No issues,1
Exactly what was discribed,1

This new case for my husband's iPad allows him to work with the iPad as if it were a mini laptop. He loves it.,1
Working perfectly in my daughter's PC as a replacement for her motherboard battery.,1
"Really enjoyed this book . Fast paced, police procedural. The detectives are sifting thru materials and clues trying to find a serial killer, as well as dealing with serious personal problems. They aren't perfect, but that's what makes the story really good- they're only human. Well thought out, no useless filler pages.",1
"I used to get acne quite often and these patches were a godsend. They didn't do much for cystic spots, but I felt like they'd clear up whiteheads in about half the time. These are also so helpful with the healing process - I'd often irritate my spots and continue messing with them but with a protective patch applied it game the spot plenty of uninterrupted time to mend. They're subtle enough to wear out of the house on a quick errand and the adhesive works really well without leaving any kind of residue behind.",1
"I like the quality and material of the bags. They are very easy to use at the supermarket, they completely replace plastic bags.",1
I love this bracelet. You can take them individually apart and wear on both wrists or not. Exactly as expected. I paid $10 on a deal of the day. Wish i bought a ton more for Christmas. It comes in a lovely box perfect for wrapping & gifting.,1
Good strong bags at a good price!,1
"the packaging is very fine inside you need to replace all the tools, I'm happy i bought this one.",1
"I don't give these out often, or lightly. This book & series gets a 5. It's everything to keep u enthralled, appalled, happy, sad, can't put it down. I love how Ann was able to mix mc & mafia into a large dysfunctional family where even when the characters show up as extended family, it all works.",1
"Daughter loves it, great quality and fast shipping. Would buy from this vendor again.",1
It takes to long to recharge it by power,1

Bought one about a month ago. Bike works great. Tremendous value compared to what you get at a dealer. Took about 2 hours to assemble and make adjustments. I'm very pleased with the bike.,1
"Beautiful, imaginative game! It gives you the feels without being corny or overdone. It does get SUPER HARD as the story progresses and Ori learns new skills. Recommended for skilled 3-D side-scroller gamers who don't get frustrated when having to play the same area over and over and over again. Loved it!",1
It is a shiny white and blue toy car! It is much bigger that I expected! The best feature of the car I enjoying is you are able to drive it above water! It is the toy you won‚Äôt regret to buy!,1
"I absolutely love these! They are exactly what I have been looking for. Up to now the only hose I could find with this level of compression were heavy and thick, they looked more like tights than hose. These are silky, feel great and look good. After reading some of the reviews I was concerned about fit - but these fit perfect. If you are used to pulling on compression hose these go on similar to other hose with this level of compression (they will be tough to get on at the foot and ankle, etc.) They take some work but any high end compression hose takes some effort to put on.",1
Great selection of interesting toys. Cat loves it.,1
Life saver with kids and locks!,1
"Easy to make. I put a large pocket near the bottom of the dress to hold dolls, etc. Fun to make and little girl liked it.",1

"I've been using the step 1 patches for the past 2 weeks. I haven't had a major craving, I do the treatment every morning. Only because I was that type that smoked first thing after rolling out of bed. I've tried the Nicoderm nicotine patches before and those made my skin very red and itchy, pretty unbearable. These, I can wear without a bad skin reaction. I've worn them mostly on my quadriceps, so my pants hold them down cause the stickiness is pretty weak.",1
Fun book! For all ages,1
"Bought for grand daughter, she likes very much not too big just right size for smaller bedroom",1
Great buoy but I had to return it for the smaller size. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô4‚Äù and the buoy was way to long on me. The smaller size was much better.,1
"I'm an avid senior softball player at the age of 62 but I became frustrated because of knee pain which was preventing me from playing or playing with excruciating pain. I've tried many different brands and I received limited relief this Puritan brand literally worked to eliminate joint pain in my throwing shoulder and my knees it was so evident. i recall that it started working within two weeks, it's now fun and enjoyable playing w/out pain . I'm going on my second year of taking it and I'll continue for the rest of life. For me, taking two at once in the morning works.....Aloha.",1

"This is simply a fantastic protector, I live in Brazil, and I am an expert in dropping my phone, I think 2 weeks after I got my phone and applied the screen protector it fell from a table to concrete, with screen down, it showed a small crack in the protector only on the edge, afterwards, I have dropped more times on asphalt and finally it fell on cobble stone, the protective screen got many cracks and in the end it started impairing use, so I took it off, amazing how it just glues to the screen. Once I took it off and cleaned my screen, the screen on the Honor 6X is completely as new. Highly recommended, really protects.",1
Perfect fit and lightweight,1

"I got this power bank to keep my iPhone charged when I am outdoor hunting Pokemon. The game drains a lot of battery so getting a portable power bank is the only way to go. I like the packaging and the design of the power bank. It looks simple but doesn't look cheap. Looks and feels much better than most of the power bank I came across in the past. I used it this weekend to go Pokemon hunting. At the end of the day, I only used a quarter of the charge and my phone is at 100% all the time. Great capacity!",1

This is so easy to install and looks great! It does tend to lean forward because the camera makes it top heavy.,1
"I‚Äôm so happy I finally bought this stroller!!! It‚Äôs so much smoother and lighter than my BOB single stroller. It‚Äôs perfect, I highly recommend it for running. It folds up easy and takes up less room than my BOB as well. If you are looking for a stroller to go shopping ( in and out of doors ) this is not for you as it‚Äôs too big to fit through normal doorways you the tiniest bit. If you, like me just wanted a stroller to pop in the trunk to go for a run this is the one for you.",1

"I bought these because they're the exact nail brushes that I used as a kid, but def didn't need this many lol. Though it'd be perfect for a family of 4. My boyfriend and I each have our own now, but I ended up regifted the remaining two as pieces of larger gifts for friends and they love them too! I have sensitive skin and nails so the bristles are all perfect, not too firm or soft. The larger bristle side has really helped with softening the skin around my nails and decreasing my cuticle growth; perfect for at home manis/pedis, and the other side that has the one line of bristles is perfect for cleaning any dirt/residue out from under your nails. Also works well on feet. Best when used after showering.",1
"Good product, as described.",1
Love the ladder. Very easy to use and doesn't take up space to store.,1
Have 2 large cats and this is the tallest scratching post I have found. Very stable. Scratching surface material seems to hold up better than the rope style. 4 surfaces for scratching.,1
Can see everything pretty much. Awesome to see deer before I get right up on them. Very bright and very affordable. Highly recommended to the ones that have issues with riding at night.,1
"The picture quality is good and viewing angle works. I am glad that I am able to rotate and move the camera lens remotely from my iphone. The installation was very straightforward and I was able to setup in 10 minutes and was able to monitor from my phone. The motion detect works ok. I had to use ""high"" setting for this. Once it detects a motion, it will notify me on my phone and also can send an email to me. I didn't setup either ftp or sd recording. But once I get a SD card, I would use an option to record a video on SD when a motion is detected than sending me an email.",1

"I was very impressed. Morgan did an excellent job pacing the story quickly and still setting the scene perfectly. I felt the characters were well-developed.

so far so good it is protecting my fridge from those unwanted blackouts,1
"feels very solid.Live in a very windy area, still hasn‚Äôt blown off the balcony.",1
"For my two children. They're teenagers and grow up quite fast, so it's necessary to help them keep their back in the right position. They use it under their sweaters during the day. It doesn't matter to them!",1

"I bought two of these to water my plants while I was out of town for two weeks. I came home and they were in great shape. Since then, I‚Äôve noticed that the water slowly hydrates over the course of a week (or more) which is perfect for them. I‚Äôm not sure how they work on more delicate plants, though. I have hardy peace lilies.",1

Saw lots of reviews that the Onyx Black from OPI was just what I needed, so I gave it a whirl and it works! One layer and it's completely opaque so it's perfect for patterns and designs. Came in a timely manner as well. I had just bought two other OPI colors from a shop that day so I felt spoiled.",1
Great flavor and not ridiculously spicy! Hard to find such a nice combination in a hot sauce. Highly recommended. Pretty cool bottle and label too!,1
This is the only product my wife uses when she is doing pole fitness. She swears by this stuff.,1
I got this dimmer switch for the outdoor patio lights we had to always plug and unplug. This switch is the best! Plug it into the lights then the outlet and you are set.

Blaze seems happy with it.,1
Bought for my mother in law,1

Nice to have this collection in 4K.,1
Easy to install. I get many compliments on the look of the button sitting on my countertop. Some reviews commented on the plastic material and how it feels cheap. I was skeptical as well once the product arrived. Works flawless! Once installed the product looks like the expensive big boxes brand. No issues pushing the button to turn on/off,1
"This iphone x case clear protection is thin, lightweight, and sturdy. I‚Äôm very happy with the designs and products. clear plastic designed with colorful rose flowers. It has a rim that runs all the way around the phone, Enhanced 4 air corner designs, it fits snug to the phone and fits comfortably in your hand. I have dropped my phone a several times and I have not had any issues. so when you lay the phone camera lens and screen-side down, the lens and screen does not actually touch anything. There are cutouts for all of the buttons, which I like. The case fits the phone extremely snugly, which gives it a secure feel, but you can still fit a thin magnet between the phone and the case for car mounting purposes, Easy to install magnetic bracket for use on cars and bikes. And never have I had one that was this resistant to scratches. It just looks and feels like my phone‚Äôs screen. The price was more than fair. In fact it was pretty cheap considering the quality of the product. As for the iphone x clear protection case, It‚Äôs practically fool proof and it came out perfect. It‚Äôs pretty great. I have had countless phone cases but never one that I was this happy with. I don‚Äôt think I will go anywhere else for a phone case again.",1

Great quality great detail!!! It's a must have!!!,1

"This couldn't be a more perfect cat tree. It's just big enough without feeling overwhelming, and small enough to fit into tiny areas. Our foster kittens love it and quickly made it the local hang out spot. Our larger 10 and 16 pound cats also find it pretty cool as well. The dangle balls/toys as expected did not last long with such a rambunctious bunch of fosters. If I had any complaints it would be that the two perches on top dont stay tight for very long. It doesn't matter how snug I make them, they always seem to come loose over time. Overall a great product for its value, and once this one is shot(which I dont think will be for a very long time since it's so well made) I plan on ordering a second",1

"I am very satisfied with this Wooden LED Alarm Clock! It‚Äôs so beautiful! The color is as what it shows online - wooden pretty black and very neat. The size is perfect for a nightstand or desk area. Set-up is easy! All you need are 4 AAA batteries. The instruction manual is pretty easy to understand, so entering the settings is no problem. And the alarm has a nice assertive sound to it, so you will definitely be woken up! What attract me most is the smart design: The time light turns off automatically so it keeps the room dark at night, but a clap or knock the table will make it on again. Both my wife and I like it so much!",1

Totally would buy if you want something simple and sleek to the dash.",1
"I have been decorating my living room with a farmhouse theme. I was working on ordering items to do a farmhouse gallery wall and started looking for a ‚Äúkey‚Äù to add to the gallery. I came across this iron key and decided to order it. It looks exactly as pictured. It is nice and heavy, but not too heavy. It was very easy to hang with a nail. I love it! You can not go wrong ordering this at all!!",1
"Its a shitty job, but hanes gets it done.",1
These little guys are great for traveling - particularly overseas. I only have to use one outlet adapter to get three U.S. outlets for charging.,1
"This is good Product and works fine, and got in time.",1
Great camera. I added a couple to my system and they have better picture than all of the other ones I have. Again great camera.,1

My Uber passengers like it. Only charges one phone at a time though.,1
"Nice product. I purchased this privacy screen for my office and it has helped tremendously with prying eyes. I had to make sure the measurements were accurate and when this came, fit perfectly! This screen is not too dark that I didn't have to adjust my light level to see. I liked this feature as well. Once I started using this, everyone stopped looking at my screen when they talk to me. Now I don't have to close everything or lock my screen when I get visitors in my office. Wonderful!!",1
Underwear just as described. They are very comfortable and the colors are also very nice. They are very well done and they feel they are good material. Will be purchasing additional underwear.,1
"I got my order and i definitely love it üòª Three tones lights. Brightness can be adjusted from high to low. Perfect for my mini bed side work station since i‚Äôm working on my laptop most of the time and sometimes i‚Äôm receiving video calls from my family while i work at night i can just use the selfie ring light with stand and phone holder clipped on desk without turning the lights on and disturb my husband while sleeping. Also, you can check the video i attached on how to use it. Very easy to operate. It has power button and other buttons for switching the light tones and brightness. Making this review because my money is not wasted üíï worth the price and quality itself ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
Love these compression socks! I'm a RN I wear them for work!,1

my son loves it best game ever he has fun with it every day he said it was the best game ever made,1
This is a must have screwdriver for any tool box. The bit selection is awesome and the magnetic storage compartment holds them inside the handle extremely well. It's a decent size for an all in one tool. Only drawback if there is one is the shank of it is a bit on the large size so for tight areas it can be an issue. Still if you're looking for a base tool this is the one.,1
"I bought this to use as a cleaner for the cymbals on my drum set and I was very happy with the results. Be aware that it will remove the printed labels, so if you are using it as a cymbal cleaner and value the look of the labels, just be careful when using.",1
The perfect pajamas for my sweet granddaughter that came to visit. She loved them.,1
Easy to use and sturdy enough that I believe my items are protected.,1

Movies are great work great in the USA Blu-ray DVD players however the case is so cheap there's no way you can store them in those cases so just go buy a new case,1
In a lot of ways it was just like the first game. Enjoyable play through and subplots. I will play this over and over again.,1
Found this on some YouTube video. I stick it on back of my ipad and use it as a mouse pad. 3M use to make a darker one like this. Wish they made it darker.,1
This product seems to work like a charm. No more nasty smells.,1
"Tested and approved! I did not use my printer, but simply a pen and these labels do stick and do not run. Highly recommended.",1
Like that has easy close lid over dispenser hole to keep picks clean. Easy to dispense one at a time.,1
"Comfortable, but bottom fitted sheet tends to bunch up due to softness.",1
"Paired with the VIVOSUN Digital Seedling Heat Mat Thermostat Controller, this heating mat allows me to keep the temp of my pepper and tomato seedlings at a steady 80 degrees. I'm on my second batch--this combination took a full week and a half off my usual germination time under lights at room temp. Reliable and does exactly what it says it will do.",1
"So far so good, I hand wash them like all my other dishes because I don't want to take any chances.",1
"Great value, will purchase again in future",1
"These make poaching eggs so easy! I never took the time to make poached eggs before getting these because it was a pain, but now I‚Äôm easily able to poach eggs for breakfast/brunch!",1
Much faster acting and equally stain and debris removing as other brands. This one is cheaper and superior.,1
My nephew is a police officer and St Michael is the patron saint of all police officers. I gave this to him with a bracelet inside and he loved it! Thank you!,1
The edge looks a little worn. Could be from style I picked.,1
Outstanding Read!!!!,1
This order contains six flat head screw drivers (red handles) and six Phillips head screw drivers (blue handles) of varying sizes for different screws. The handles are made of tough rubber that appears unlikely do go brittle over time as was the case with some I've used. Stanley is known for quality products and these belong in my tool box.,1
Shipped fast! Supplement works great.,1
Good action. Good story lines. Rented for four bucks. Will buy the Blu-ray soon.,1
"I absolutely loved this oil! I initially bought it to help de stress, since I read a lot about the benefits it had for relaxation, but I wasn‚Äôt expecting to love the scent so much! I wear it as a perfume now. It suggests that you only dab a little since it is so powerful, but I wear it behind my ears, on my neck and on my wrists and holy goodness! I must say that I feel like singing Stevie Nicks every time I smell it. I also loved the soap and lotion sample that came with it. FYI the relaxation properties are also there. If I could give it more stars I would. Buy it!",1
"We have a pretty big yard and I needed something to fill a big blank wall. This is absolutely perfect! It comes with 10 different slides so I can change them out every night. So easy to put together, has a great base and is nice and heavy duty. I like that i have the option to switch slides. Snowflakes, Santa, reindeer, ornaments, presents, and snowmen! And you can change the speed of the slide and add red dots to the background! I highly recommend this product!!",1

These mailers are very nice and classy looking. Definitely gives a VIP feel to my products.,1
"Purchased these for my trailer, and they worked perfectly. Based on the price, I was expecting a few to be non-functional. But all of them worked, much to my surprise. They were even properly polarized to allow the LED portion of the board face in the correct orientation in my RV lights. The color temperature is perfect for a more natural light, and I greatly reduced the total current draw on the batteries across all 20 lights. Highly recommend",1
I had a lot of mood swings before and this stuff helped alleviate that. It's just my first week of usage and I'm impressed already. I guess I'll be keeping a stock of this product,1

The product is very good. My son is very satisfied with the use of it The price has come down on these substantially. They arrived on time and does the job well. The few times that I have used it so far it has charged my phone quickly without issue. Quality seems superb and the strength is what I've been looking for. It charges her iPhone and the iPad nicely. Excellent quality material.,1
"It really helped to clear up space on my nightstand. It‚Äôs made from heavy duty materials, so I can remove my phone and AirPods case with one hand - the stand stays put. I also like the way it tucks away the charging cords, unlike other stands. This is a great stand. You won‚Äôt be disappointed!",1

These look very nice on the double doors to our home office.,1
"I‚Äôve had my Mavic Air for 2 months now, flown it in North America and Asia in multiple environments and this has been by far the best accessory I have bought for my Mavic Air. It was quickly delivered, packaged efficiently, and fits the gimbal perfectly. Gimbal movement works great and no difference as advertised; glares are significantly reduced and shots aren‚Äôt overexposed thanks to the lens (see attached photos)! After looking through many other Mavic Air lens products, this is by far the best price and quality option...I would highly recommend it!",1
These are great for sending kids snacks to daycare! I ordered a few different types to see what I liked best and these were easy to clean and use.,1
Love that this bag fits my Spectra S2 and a laptop with room to spare!,1
I GOT 26 CHANNEL FOR HOUSE . NO CABLE NEED!!!!,1
Ms. Samuels Young never disappoints. I recieved an email about the e-release for this book. I immediately downloaded it as I make it a point to read all of her books. I read the first page of this book and was immediately hooked. I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN FOUR HOURS. This is one of her by far best writes. She pushes to a new extreme of erotic suspense and has done an amazingly great job at it. The sex scenes are steamy and the order of events are not your typical guess what happens next. You will not be disappointed. I would love a part II to this book... Keep them coming Pamela!,1
"Liking the durability and feel of this comforter. It did shrink a tiny bit when I washed and dried it, but that worked out for us.",1

"Good quality, versatile fit. Very good value compared to other belts.",1
"For approx. $160 you can't go wrong. Only complaint I would have is that I wish there was an extra loop on the rubber wrist band to hold the free end of the band once buckled in place. Other than that, very sharp looking watch. Beefy, great luminescence at night once you've lit it up with a flash light. Masculine look and feel. Plus the solar power (Eco-drive) for it means never replacing a battery. Keeps time perfectly. Have not had to adjust it a single time - no seconds gain/loss month to month.",1
"Awesome book, this story made me laugh, get mad, cry, loved the story. Thank you David Joy, keep them coming",1
I think this Pulley is better than the original one. Very sturdy made.,1
Stacey is a vocal wonder. Live recording is okay.,1

Can't get enough of Magnum.,1
"In searching for a battery for a work laptop, I was greatly surprised to find a battery that actually fit perfect that was not an OEM. The battery fit perfectly and is working perfectly. The laptop is a 17 inch Dell that weighs a ton based on other laptops I've owned/used, so the length of time to work on battery is not that long, but long enough. I honestly can't say for sure exactly how long, but I know it's at least 2-3 hours. My 14 inch laptop only lasts about 6 hours.",1
Great fun and entertaining games for this most special occasion.,1
Works better than I thought.,1
I like this item because it holds a lot more than my other chill med! So I know I always have enough product.,1
"I have recently started using my jojoba oil, I have used it as a facial oil in my nighttime routine and I love love love it!! A couple drops max goes a LONG way! I love how it rubs in very nicely and does not leave you oily at all. I am very impressed and will be looking at purchasing the rest of their products to try out as I also love the body butter!!! I know I have said love alot but I do also love the details in the packaging, everything you need to know is on every side of the box and bottle as well and you can use this oil very many more options then just your face such as, whole body, face, in your hair ect look it up, the options are endless!!",1
"I have been searching for a advent calendar to do with my children and this was absolutely perfect. It tells not only the story of Christ‚Äôs birth and the nativity but also the people and events of the Bible that set the story into motion many years before, starting with the Creation. My children enjoyed the stories and, most of all, hanging the ornaments each night. This will become a tradition in our home.",1

"Beautiful ! Love this so much , I love Harry potter and when I saw this I really wanted one , such a great quote",1
"This works in very cold temperatures. I have it out in my garage. When I leave it on overnight in the winter, by the morning its still running, but the bin is almost full, and it is a solid block of ice. I thaw out the bin, dump it, put it back in and it starts refilling again",1
The dog loves them They were delivered on the date promised.,1
Carry-on is Perfect for any travel.very light to carry,1

Just what I needed to match existing handles.,1
Great quality chair cover. Measured perfectly for my oversized chair.,1
I didn't know parchment liners were available until I read it on a baking website. Since I use parchment in all my baking I was glad to find these. They are a good basic liner and I will be reordering as needed.,1

"This hose nozzle feels pretty durable. It‚Äôs not real heavy duty, so I‚Äôm wondering how it will hold up. For now, I‚Äôll rate it at 5 stars because it seems like it‚Äôs good quality. Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be using it until the weather gets a little warmer. I got it as a stocking stuffer for my husband.",1
This little turkey is great! He sways back and forth without a care in the world. Love the colors!,1
Install was ok didnt come across some issues but fixed. The lock mechanism gets stuck sometimes. But I think that is because of my door alignment and not the lock. Overall good product.,1

They don't make em like this anymore. Tons of nerdy humor.,1
My daughter loved them!,1

The cover was ready to use. It provided immediate increased comfort. It also washes nicely. I have no negative comments at this time.,1
"This is a very neat phone/camera stick! what's great about it is that it comes with a very unique mini tripod that you can use to take group photos, yet it's as compact and about the same weight as a small selfie stick. I've used it in my recent ski trip and everyone was amazed by it, setting it up and taking pictures is super easy, and there is even a remote control for triggering the photo function. Overall I'm extremely happy with it and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",1

Put in under a desk. Came with mounting screws.,1
"It does it;s job, it makes ya POOP!!!",1
"I've tried the Apple Pencil and it's good for certain applications but I didn't like the cost. I thought I'd try this one out and am pleasantly surprised. It's great that this stylus works with all devices old and new. I use this with an older ipad that doesn't support the new pencils. It's pretty accurate and let's me do more detailed things such as drawing or writing. It's easy to charge through the micro usb port. Another great feature is that the top/eraser part of the stylus works without battery. Overall, this is a nicely thought out stylus for a good price.",1
"Was the perfect size light weight, we are using it for our trailer. Good for a full size cat.",1

We love the covers - they fit the forms in a way that looks crisp and smooth. I love having them on the sofa!",1
Love these water shoes! They do run a little small but I prefer a snug fit when it comes to water shoes. I really enjoy that they are slip resistant. I ordered my husband a pair also he wants to try them for when he bow hunts.,1

This Pirate hat exceeded all of my expectations. I just wore it on a Disney Cruise for Pirate night and got numerous compliments.,1
Great product. Worked well. Practice and be patient. Watch the manufacturers videos for tips. Tools produced clean quality caulk lines superior to a coved finger applied caulk line. As a hardware store owner I‚Äôve seen and used many different tools to apply caulk. This tool set is the best I‚Äôve ever used.,1
My fiance loves his cigar case and the quality is quite impressive. We're going to treat it with distilled water as others have suggested. Great value for the money spent!,1
Like it just wish it was precut,1
Needs a couple days to flatten out but it does work very well to catch the litter.,1
Love it!! Keeps cold and hot drinks the same temp for a long long time. Does not leak. Dropped it a few times tho but still works perfectly fine! Would definitely buy another one!,1
I received these bags a couple days ago and I have yet to use them but they seem really durable. They seal nice and tight and are made of a thick material. They're super easy to clean and look like they can hold a decent amount. I'll update if anything changes but so far so good! Would highly recommend these to anyone looking for reusable bags!,1
I love the feel of these sheets and the colors are very pretty. They look amazing in my room. Would definitely buy again.,1
Definatly large and nice to have extra room for a larger sleeping bag. Will not fit a queen size sleeping bag but it will hold a larger outfitter style setup no problem. I matched it with the xxl cot matress from them also and a very good buy,1
"Great book with lots of inspiration! The recipes are very detailed, easy to follow and helpful. I have tried some recipes of this book and all smoothies were delicious and healthy.",1
"This was really good. I've been reading a lot of reverse harem and while some are kind of our there, though still good, there are some who really catch my attention and leave me wanting. This book was in the latter. Totally left me wanting! I not only liked it, I loved it actually! And cannot wait for more!",1
I like the thin profile of these cutting boards.,1
Makes crafting easy.,1
I like everything about this product. Stopped my feet from peeling within 24 hours.,1
I read 30 to 40 books a year for work and this is already on my Top of 2019 list. Most books on leadership communication and speaking are stale and hard to put into action from the page to reality - not so with Speaking To Influence. All of the information Laura provides is actionable and easy to digest. I'm a big fan and will be referring this book to my C-Suite corporate clients.,1
"Headline says it all. I have a desktop tower on the bottom shelf, next shelf I have a server and 4 hard drive dock bays. The third has a network switch - 24 port and modem and router, the last has networking tools and computer tool kit. Easy to assemble, sturdy and does what I want. Would get again if I need another shelf.",1
This was a gift to our kids in Alaska; and they were thrilled . Thank you so much for such a wonderful blanket.,1
"a True American Treasure Get the DVD, at least for me one I will view again and again, Fantastic production in so many ways!",1
Works better than expected,1
Fits my hand nicely. Now I have to test the grip of holding a firearm.,1
"This dress is very comfortable. I love the color and the fit. In cooler months I can wear it with leggings, boots, and a sweater.",1
"Cool easy to use sun shade. I wasn't sure if it would fit on my Corolla window but it's perfect. No more squinting on my way to work, yea!",1
This is what I have been looking for!,1
"For the size and quality, Def a good price. Better than something you can find at Marshalls.",1
My wife is very please with this.,1
I plan to use these to make Christmas ornaments. The seem to be just what I wanted and needed for my project.,1
For granddaughter. Arrived healthy. Used in fairy garden and terrarium. She loves the way they turned out.,1
Bought it for a present for my husband he loved it.,1

This is the effect series to start up while you wait for the next Jane Yellowrock book to come out. I hope Nell and Rick end up together. I can't stand him with Jane but he is ok in this series.,1
Fits on my generator perfectly. Very happy.,1
Great item. Don't really use the suction cups because my bath is so slim. Really love it though!,1
"Firstly, I'm not your average joe when it comes to a car wash. This is the best product I have ever used on my Corvette. I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time. You will wish you can thank me. This is the perfect stuff to keep your car looking its vest you wont even want to drive it! Thanks Car Guys, you guys are something else. This product is really a 10/5 stars",1
This ribbon is so adorable! Goes perfect with my elf theme Christmas tree this year!,1
I am in love with this kettle.,1
"My Doberman Loves Having His Nails Trimmed and His Ears Cleaned When These Treats Are Present, I'd say he's a pushover and I owe a lot to these tasty treats. I will buy again!!",1

A wish I would've ordered one size smaller (I am usually a S/M and am 5'3) and it is a little long. But it is great quality and a beautiful cover up! I have tied it up as a shirt with jean shorts too and it's really cute.,1
