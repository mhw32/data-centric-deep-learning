"These are AWFUL. They are see through, the fabric feels like tablecloth, and they fit like children’s clothing. Customer service did seem to be nice though, but I regret missing my return date for these. I wouldn’t even donate them because the quality is so poor.",0
I bought 4 and NONE of them worked. Yes I used new batteries!,0
On first use it didn't heat up and now it doesn't work at all,0
You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon. Only a baby would be able to wear the size of the earring. They were SO small. the size of a pin head I at first thought Amazon had forgotten to enclose them in the bag! I didn't bother to take them out of the bag and you can have them back. Will NEVER order another thing from your company. A disgrace. Honest enough for you? Grandma,0
The glue works fine but the container is impossible to work with. The cap doesn't come off without plyers and then won't go back on without a violent abrupt force involving both hands and a solid object (desk drawer). This happened even though I was careful to not gum up the lid or tapering snout.,0
"I was over the moon when I got this. I love sunflowers and it looked exactly like they advertised, unfortunately I wore this piercing for one weekend. By Sunday night the sunflower had came off. I will not be purchasing from this company again. Very disappointed.",0
"Gotta say, not impressed with the quality. I mean, I can't say I expected it to be overwhelmingly amazing with the cost being where it's at. But, certainly I thought it would last longer than a few days. Had the phone in my gym bag. Slid out from the side and barely tapped the wall. On the aluminum side. Not even on the glass. And low and behold, instantaneous crack. Oddly enough, just on the back. Not a splinter at all on the front. Not sure if the back is intentionally more susceptible to damage or just my luck. Either way, I have to give this product a thumbs down. Wish it held up better. It really is a nice design. I am a fan of how the product looks and the concept. No issue there. Just not durable at all.",0
I would give this zero stars if I could. This is 6.3 you ounces of low grade chocolate for $60. My 9 year old daughter was so disappointed. It didn't even have a different piece for each day. It was mostly flat square wrapped milk chocolate with no design at all!!! Very very poor quality and expensive!,0
Two of the glasses were broken when I opened the package. Could you please be careful for packaging glass items.,0
Doesn’t even work . Did nothing for me :(,0
"Really, really thin.",0
Never received item. Given a refund.,0
Terrible!!!! I couldnt even attach it to the screen,0
My package arrived with nothing in it?! My cord that I use for my phone is broken and I was really depending on this replacement. I will give a better rating when I have something to rate!!,0
"I mean the case looks cool. I don’t know anything about functionality but they sent me a iPhone 8 Plus case. The title says 6 plus, I ordered a 6 plus and there was no option on selecting another iPhone size beside 6 and 6 plus so I’m very disappointed in the service",0
I did not receive this item.,0
I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS BUT I DON'T. THE SMELL IS NOT STRONG AT ALL NO MATTER HOW MUCH OF IT ADD.,0
Belt loops were not fastened upon opening. They were not stitched.,0
"These headphones were great in the beginning. Easy to charge, stayed in my ears, and had great sound quality. Unfortunately, they crapped out about a year after I purchased them. They will charge but no longer turn on.",0
Ran entirely too small,0
"Had them for like a month, during which time I used them maybe once for 5 minutes. Otherwise kept in the included case. They broke right away. The nosepiece - which is made of a paper-like material glued to a tiny strip of clear plastic - snapped the second time I tried to wear them. Since it's the only thing that holds them up, the glasses essentially became trash after that. Don't waste your time no matter how deep the discount.",0
"I bought Halo before, but this one does not look the same! It seems to have lots of fat (a white greasy substance) in it!",0
First of all the package was shoved into my mail box and was basically crushed when I pulled it out. In addition there are deep marks and scrapes that show the wallet was used or pre-owned before getting to me..,0
The battery covers screw stripped out the first day on both cars I purchased for Christmas.,0
Shame you can't give it 0 stars I ordered this and the package says shipped but I did not receive the package contacted the seller 2 times and still no answer after two weeks very disappointed.,0
It didn’t work at all. All the wax got stuck at the top and would never flow.,0
"The clear backing lacks the stickiness to keep the letters adhered until you’re finished weeding! It’s so frustrating to have to keep up with a bunch of letters and pieces that have curled and fell off the paper! It requires additional work to make sure that they’re aligned properly and being applied on the right side, which was an issue for me several times! I purchased 3 packs of this and while it’s okay for larger designs, it sucks for lettering or anything intricate 😏 Possibly it’s old and dried out, but in any event, I will not be buying from this vendor again and suggest that you don’t either!",0
"Sorry but these are a waste of money! The balls constantly fall off after a certain amount of time and the paint/coloring chips off! It’s gross, but I had a big piece of the color chip off while I was wearing one, which meant extra cleaning later that evening. POOR QUALITY, don’t waste your money on these ones!! :(",0
NEVER RECEIVE THIS PRODUCT EVEN AFTER CONTACTING THE SELLER MORE THAN ONCE,0
I never bought this product so why the hell isn't showing up in my order history,0
"Very disappointed in the quality, patterns and size I will donate or give away. Very unhappy.",0
Guess i picked the wrong flavor. Sunflower seed is disgusting. I’ll be tossing them after eating a few out one bag.,0
It wasn't the size in the picture never again going to buy this product,0
"I've been using this product with my laundry for a while now and I like it, but I had to return it because it wasn't packaged right and everything was damaged.",0
Added so much to the projects! Works well.,0
"Purchased in June 2019 and no longer works two months later???? The button (for arms to release or hold the phone) is locked and therefore mechanism doesn't work....... We love the features of this make & model, but going to look elsewhere for something more reliable.",0
It does not work and it smells really bad,0
The item u sent me was not what I ordered no stars,0
The dragon was missing paint and there was glue or something all over the dragon.,0
Wrong item shipped. Ask for connectors and got a box of fuses!!! What a waste of my time waiting for this to arrive.,0
I had it less than a week and the c type tip that connects to my S9 got burnt.,0
I was very disappointed in this item. It is very soft and not chewy. It falls apart in your hand. My dog eats them but I prefer a more chewy treat for my dog.,0
I am very annoyed because it came a day late and it didn’t come with the ferro rod and striker which is the main reason why I ordered it,0
Waste of money!! Don’t buy this product. just helping community. I trusted reviews about that but all wrong,0
"The wires did not last long at all. The piece that connects to the phone comes off, you have to have the phone sitting in a certain position for the phone to charge.",0
"I ordered a screen for an iPhone 8 Plus, but recevied product that was for a different phone. A significantly smaller phone.",0
"I was so excited about this and wanted to like it so much. My dog (who is not a strong chewer AT ALL) destroyed it in under 5 minutes :/ $11 down the drain for NOTHING. Great concept, extremely poor execution unfortunately.",0
"WE ORDERED THIS, HUNG THE LIGHT AND ONLY 4 OUT OF THE 5 LIGHTS WORKED.",0
"I got 2 pars in different colors. When started using them realized that its too late to return. Not comfortable, give blisters in the open area where the toes are each step getting worst. ended-up with 5 blisters in the different area of my feet. . The sole is coming apart, I had to glue it. I feel ripped off.",0
This lasted 2 weeks after using it for 1 days. So disappointing!,0
I have been using this for several years and recently bought several only to find out that they all have perfume in them now.,0
"Flawed disc, stopped about 5-10 minutes before the end.of the movie. Not up to Amazone standards.",0
One of the leather string fell apart in the first week 😂😂 overall looks awesome,0
"You only get one cat toy....as is deceiving, they show three toys.",0
"Dulled severely after a single use, caused the drill to buck and nearly took my father’s finger off. Tried it again several more times, and it caught and kicked every time. You get what you pay for.",0
Wrong product was sent,0
"I wouldn't know because it says that my item was delivered, but it is not here.",0
have not used it yet,0
wast of money fake did one launch broke a immediately.,0
Please be very careful.... This wax gets extremely hot. It blistered my face in 4 different spots..,0
Only worked for 15 min,0
They sent me 4 of the same flag it’s not like the picture shows,0
I received 99cent wet and wild brushes instead of the limited edition real techniques blush and contour brushes I ordered.,0
Extremely disappointed. The video from this camera is great. The audio is a whole other story!!! No matter what I do I get tons of static. Ive used several different external mics and the audio always ends up being unusable. I really wish I would've researched this camera some more before buying it. Man what a waste of money.,0
They are all smashed. I have pictures. They look melted and all smashed.,0
"The child hat is ridiculously small. It was not even close to the right size for my 3 year old son. I checked the size, and it wouldn't have even fit him as a newborn. I liked the adult hat but it is not sold separately. The seller was rude and unhelpful when I contacted them directly through Amazon. The faux fur pom was either already torn or tore when I was trying on the hat. See the attached photograph. The pom came aprt, exposing the inner fluff.",0
Did not received product,0
"SUPER disappointed. The metal is thin, flimsy, bent and unstable.",0
Since I got it out of the package it didn't work at all. Couldn't even press the button because it was stuck. Returned. Very disappointed.,0
Definitely not Carolina Reaper Peppers. These look like Thai chili peppers. Do not buy. Big waste of money.,0
Product was fine but only 2 were in the packet v 3 as advertised. I contacted the distributor they said they would send out another one which they didn't. I never heard back from Amazon either. It was very expensive for two bags!,0
Does not work. Not supported by device pops up.,0
It is cheap - and yes it is a CHEAP product.,0
The FIRST time I used this product the zipper broke. It arrived 3 hours ago and I'm already sending it back. I'm very frustrated as I wasted time debating between this product and competitors. Obviously I made the wrong choice.,0
Does not work as described.,0
The Product arrived broken. Amazon immediately put me in touch with CPO the sellers. CPO said they will not honor the Amazon product return refund policy without pictures of the item sent prior to the item being returned. Beware do not buy from this third party vendor.,0
FIRE HAZARD DO NOT PURCHASE. Used once as instructed wires melted and caught fire!!!,0
"When you order a product, you expect the product to be as described. They were advertised as CAP Dumbbells. However, the product received was Golds Gym dumbbells. If I wanted Golds Gym, I would have bought these from Walmart. I have a complete set of CAP dumbbells, with the exception of my one set from Golds Gym. Is the weight correct, yes. Due they perform, yes. I just expect to get what I paid for not something else. After reading a few other reviews, I see that others have had the same issue.",0
I bought this product and thought it was awesome in the box but when I shot it I discovered it jammed frequently and pinches you at the top unless your very careful and after about 10 ft the pellet curves upward severely. After it fell from a barely 2 ft tall coffee table it broke and would not cock Iv also noticed after reading a lot of reviews that this is frequent,0
"We have had this since May 2019, so only 3 months and the timer has stopped working on it and it turns itself off.",0
"Bought it, worked for couple weeks then didn’t. Exchanged it. Worked for a month then didn’t. Bought a pack of batteries but nothing is vibrating now and dog still barks. It’s a 0% chance of it working for very long. Can’t return now.",0
Phone has scratches all over it after less than a month of regular using,0
It arrived broken. Not packaged correctly.,0
"Wish I would of read the reviews prior to purchase. This DVD is sadly the worst DVD I have ever purchased. Either here on Amazon or other sites. It plays on my DVD player but the quality is horrible. Also, the first 15-20 minutes or so is just unwatchable. The picture is all scrambled. This is obviously a shoddy bootlegged version from a vhs tape. Amazon really needs to stop selling this!!!",0
Instructions are confusing and poorly written.,0
"description incorrect, only received one book. Cheap packaging, wrapped with some sort of brown paper.",0
We've had nothing but problems with it doesn't function and the screen is constantly having problems will not stay on troubleshoot is it and still the screen will not come on,0
broke the first time I used it.,0
Doesn't distribute the steam strong enough small fan but it is quiet but who cares,0
"Did not stick to the wall at all, a lot of it was ripped and it wasn't as full as pictured. I wish I could get my money back but the only way to find out how bad this product is was to use it. Super disappointed, I would not recommend this at all.",0
He’d are just cheap polyester sheets. NOT MICROFIBER! Not super soft. They’re silky soft like cheap polyester is.,0
Use at your own risk. My wife and I both had burning sensation and skin reactions. No history of sensitive skin.,0
Plugged in and did not charge only music played from one ear of earphone.TERRIBLE,0
"Terrible product ! Came with moldy batteries AND when I replaced the batteries, nothing worked. It was a huge disappointment",0
This product seems worthless for me. I don’t think they work for anything. I am sorry I bought them.,0
"The picture shows the fuel canister with the mosquito repeller attached so I assumed it would be included. However, when I opened the package I discovered there was no fuel. Since it is not included, the picture should be removed. If someone orders this and expects to use it immediately, like I did, they will be very disappointed.",0
Lasted one wear and then melted off when worn on the pavement. I took them off and the adhesive was all over the bottom so i took them to a cobbler instead and got them professionally done. Would not ever put these on my red bottoms again.,0
never got it after a week when promised,0
"I love it It is adorable , perfect size! But my glass part has a crack, can you please replace the glass part? Thank you",0
"Not wanting to give it any stars, I gave it 1. Sound quality stinks and that is only with the music it will listen to. It won’t connect or even recognize the Apple 11Pro it was trying to connect to, so it never worked to make phone calls even with my Bose earbuds. I’m going back to Apple products. They know what they’re doing.",0
I never received this item.,0
"It wasn't what I thought it was so I sent it back , for someone that ordered the right thing the process was perfect",0
It already stopped working. It no longer charges.,0
"There is a very strong, offensive odor on the inside!!",0
"We ordered 4 diff brands so we could compare and try them out and this one was by far the worst, once you sat down. You felt squished. I’m 5.5 and 120 lbs. My husband could barely fit.",0
The color is mislabeled. This is supposed to be brown/blonde but comes out almost white. Completely unusable.,0
Fell apart the same day. Had to connect the lighting wires myself.,0
First carwash and for force of the water broke the light. Poor quality would not recommend.,0
Love the color ... but didn't fit.,0
Absolutely worthless! Adhesive does not stick!,0

Product in tube was dried up and not usable,0
I never receive my stuff.,0
It doesn’t stick to my car and it’s to big,0
I ordered this bodysuit in 3-6 months and they sent me a 6-12 months. The label on the plastic bag says a different size of the one in the label on the bodysuit. I don’t know if I should order it again because I am afraid they would send me a completely different size.,0
"Candy was shipped on a Friday, arrived on Tuesday, and in terrible shape...all melted and gooey. It was sent in some insulated wrapping but still did not survive the heat. Lesson learned. Don't order chocolate in summertime.",0
I ordered this for Ps4 (it says on the order ps4 and everything) but received an Xbox one copy. I'm trying to figure out how to return or exchange it now.,0
The comforter is super hot but washed the first time and the fabric ripped. Super cheap quality.,0

Only worked for two months.,0
Item did not fit my car properly.,0
I received a broken angle plate and i m very upset for the package!!!!!!,0
This will not help you with finding anything at all. It doesn’t offer any true guidance. Just some basic questions and you write your response. It’s just a journal nothing more. Very disappointed. Instead of wasting your money on this I would recommend The path made clear by Oprah is way more helpful. Or just get yourself a notebook and write your daily thoughts down and reflect once a week. That’s it. Save your money.,0
These did not work at all. The batteries neither came with a charge on them or would take a charge. Terrible product.,0
"Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky",0
Received this today and it doesn’t fit my .40 clip very disappointing!!,0
The package only had 1 rectangular pan and 1 cupcake pan. Missing 2 rectangular pans.,0
I don’t think the design fits for the phone. It blocks the fingerprint on the side. I can’t use my fingerprint to unlock the phone with this case on.,0
I don’t receive my package until now I check the front desk nothing and my mail box so what up with that though?,0
Not working for me at all.,0
Put brand new batteries in it and after a couple days the light started blinking red. Went to the store bought new batteries installed those and still blinking red nothing is inside of the trap.,0
Wore sandles 3x and they are starting to come apart on the side. So bummed!,0

"This does not stay inflated and after the first use, it has not lit again although it has been charged",0
"not sturdy, can definitely catch your feet.",0
"The idea of this truck was really cool until it arrived with a small crack. My son went to open one side and the plastic broke all the way, which has rendered the truck useless since it is sharp and dangerous. I would not recommend this product.",0
"It worked only for a little over a month and died. Fortunately, we bought protection plan and exchanged it for free. Hoping the next one is not defective.",0
Better off buying the kits,0
"I opened a bottle of this smart water and took a large drink, it had a very strong disgusting taste (swamp water). I looked into the bottle and found many small particles were floating in the water... a few brown specs and some translucent white. I am completely freaked out and have contacted Coca-Cola, the product manufacture.",0
It was easy to put together and I was excited for this night stand but the drawers I believed are defective. The top part is flush; however they don’t close all the way on the bottom.,0
"My husband uses this for travel/home and it quit charging after a couple months. Sadly, I bought two.",0
I bought this because I teach Geometry and the one that the school gives us is not accurate enough and opens easily and I thought This would be better. I was Wrong. The lead constantly pushes through anytime I try And use it. It is very frustrating and the compass is useless.,0
"This is a huge health hazard to your baby. We checked the battery after a couple weeks of use and saw that water went into the compartment where the batteries go. The batteries themselves had rotted and a black liquid was coming out of them. Looking at the design, it appears that theres no way the battery enclosure could be waterproof meaning not only did water go into the compartment during bathtime, some of that toxic material came out as well. Please do not buy this product. I’m shocked that it was allowed to go to market despite such an obvious flaw.",0
I immediately returned it. You use to have it with a lemon scent which was very pleasant.,0
not received but shows delivered,0
Didn't work at all. Our brand new Xbox One X did nothing with the Kinect One.,0
This product arrived late and no return policy.,0

"I love the idea of this gate and the way it looks but I’ve now had two and they both broke, one broken outta the box and the other broke pretty immediately after setting it up. Super disappointed especially for the cost!!",0
Very poor product ! It does not stick to the page ..we need to use tape if we want it to adhere,0
The motor burned out today. I have used this grinder very little over the time I have had it.,0

"Order hose for home use, installed hose on my hose reel. 3.5 months later hose has a leak close to end attached to hose reel. While hose did not kink it was hard to move and heavy. Hose has a 12 year warranty. Tried to contact company but only international numbers available, page ask for email. Reluctant to send email to unknown company with only overseas address. I do not recommend using this brand of hose. Contacted by Worth Garden Sept. 6, 2018 with emails stating replacement hose would be sent. No word emailed Sept. 13, 2018 about no replacement Hose, answered they were working on it. Today Sept. 28, 2018 still no replacement Hose or email. Appears Hose is as good as Warranty. Would not recommend buying from Worth Garden.",0
We never could get this bulb camera to work. I’ve had 3 people try this bulb at different locations and it will not connect to the internet and will not set up.,0
"Sadly, really doesn't seem to work worth a darn. Maybe is the particular kind of dust where I am but It just makes patterns in the dust. Doesn't seem to capture it or lift it off.If I can still return it I will.",0
"They don't adjust. There is a rough, plastic piece that either rubs on the ear or presses in on the head. I only wore them for 5 min 2x a day to walk dog and my head is KILLING ME! DON'T BUY! Will return mine!",0
So after finally sitting down to print some documents I found that the cartridge has bands in it. tried walking through all the instructions on cleaning it however if a state that if it doesn't work then more than likely that cartridge needs to be replaced. So it was a waste of $100 on this ink. I WONT be buying from this seller ever again,0
This wasn't indicated anywhere in the description before I purchased -- these are designed to prevent blade replacement! That makes these far and away the most expensive scalpel blades I've ever bought.,0
"The book was hard to keep up with as it jumped around a lot. Also the title doesn’t fit the story. The author indicated several people were infected by this alien, however left out may details on when or how it happened. I was confused at times and had to go back and re read a lot to make sure I didn’t miss anything.",0
Soooo disappointed. The images look as though they are a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy to the point where they are so distorted and there is nothing to even color! You'd be better off making your own!,0
"my expectations were low for a cheap scale. they were not met, scale doesnt work. popped the cover off the back to put a battery in and the wires were cut and damaged. wouldn't even turn on. sending it back. product is flimsy and cheap, spend 20 extra bucks on a better brand or scale.",0
This product came damaged and package arrived open. Very frustrating that this product is unable to be returned while is it still under the 30 day amazon return policy. Very unsatisfied with this purchase.,0
Cannot rate the product because the recipient never got it. The tracking said the order was delivered but it never arrived.,0

Amazon never deliver the items. Horrible customer service. Considering new purchase choices.,0

Worst fucking item I ever bought on Amazon I had a headache for 2 days on this bullshit I thought I had to go to the emergency room please don't but real costumer,0

Doesn’t work at all! Took family to the camping trip and used this product hoping to avoid mosquito bites. Instead getting bitten all over.,0
I’m extremely disappointed with this purchase. The amount of pilling on these blankets is unreal. I have blue fuzz all over my house. I’m surprised there is any blanket left. I followed the washing instructions and both times I have washed them they have come out terribly. I would not buy.,0
The white is the only one that doesn’t break off so easily . They’re all trash though.,0
One half stopped working after month of use,0
These contain carrageenan and corn syrup. They taste ok but these chemicals make these undesirable to me.,0

Did not find the app very useful at all.,0

Feels very light and cheaply made FM radio did not even work...very unhappy with my purchase and do not recommend buying this one!!!!,0
"I wish I had taken a picture of the set before I sent it back. But just know that the fork tine split off and the knife had splinters on it that snagged the gauzy bag for storage. The reason I purchased this was to see how the bamboo ones differed. One good thing is that the weight of bamboo is quite a bit less than metal utensils. Couldn't comment on ""Easy To Clean"" since I didn't actually use it - afraid of splinters!",0
Digging tool bent the first time out in loose soil. Also the orange grip slips off.,0
Bought for my piano. Tuner would not pick up the top and bottom registers of piano. Also I felt there was too much variance of tuner itself when attempting tuning. Checked it against a tuner app on smart phone and many notes 5 to 10 cents off. Will send back.,0
"I ordered this Instant Pot Pressure Cookbook when it was on sale through Amazon. There is poor editing throughout this recipe book. Many recipes have missing steps and ingredients. There is no index, only a table of contents that is difficult to use. Even the table of contents is not alphabetized so you have to read down the entire list to find a recipe. The author assumes you already know how to use the Instant Pot. There are no reminders regarding sealing the Instant Pot lid or any other safety instructions. These instructions would have been helpful to those of us who are new to the Instant Pot.",0
"They are the right size, but have no odor control like the Breeze pads That’s important to me with two large cats. I’d rather have the odor control than save the money, as I live in a small apartment,& I don’t enjoy smelling cat pee.",0
"THE PRODUCT IS NOT CORRECT TO DESCRIPTION Ordered this item recieved incorrect five button remote that is a completely different one than the item listed. Sent for a return thinking it was a warehouse mistake, recieved the exact same incorrect keyfobs. DO NOT RECCOMMEND if looking for the item in the picture. At this point im just going to order from the dealer. *note: it will work when paired to unlock and lock but other functions as remote start and panic button will not function at all*",0
"REALLY needed this, so ordered two weeks ahead of needing it to take my PA to a friend's house for a party. Well, the packaging came apart and I kept getting notices that delivery was rescheduled. Only after many days was I able to determine that they just returned what's left to Amazon and cancelled the sale. ?? Why they wouldn't dispatch another one is beyond me, so I had to stack amps and EQ's on a table and buy some rubber feet to put between them so they didn't slide around. Real professional looking to have $6K in gear stacked on a table. So, it may be ok if you get one- but chances are you won't, or at least you won't get all of it like SO many reviews state. Just don't bother until Amazon realizes these need to be boxed properly.",0
I did not see and changes in my hair.... Maybe its not for Black or African American hair?,0
"I have no idea of this thing works or not. After a hour of tried to just set it to go off, I finally gave up, put in in the box and sent it right back. I read the directions over and over. Sooo confusing.",0

"I received my jug of Hope's Perfect Glass Cleaner Refill The jug arrived without a cap, just the foil seal. Love the product, but certainly not the delivery. The product pictures the jug with a black plastic cap. Hope the contents of the jug doesn't spill. What a pain!!",0
Received this item today and took my dog for a walk and it snapped in 5 minutes. She wasn’t even pulling. No stars.,0
Came in a box with bottled water. Bag was crushed and opened.,0
"Very cheaply made, do not think this is quality stainless steel. The leafs of the steamer were sticking together and not opening smoothly. Poor quality in comparison to the Pyrex brand I had for 15 years. Returned.",0
"Poorly written, not much substance, much better books on the subject",0
"Do not waste your money on this piece of junk! The lid doesn’t fit properly on the container and it leaks. I bought two and they both leak. I filled it with water and kept it in my car. It is too big for the cupholder because it is so bulky and hard to hold so I set it on the passengers seat next to me, But anytime it tipped over it started to slowly leak. I ended up throwing both of them out and buying swell instead",0
"Worked great except I only used it maybe 4 times and it just suddenly stopped working, wont do anything now",0
"My little boy wanted this so bad. He is pretty disappointed with it. It hardly picks up toys at all. And if you drop them in the shoot, half of them fall out the front. Total waste of money!",0
"Never received product. Supposedly it was shipped in box with 4 other items, this was not in there.",0
This was not the shoe I ordered. The lacing system was not as depicted in the photo. Instead of eyelets there were nylon straps that broke when I first tightened them.,0
"First it claims that it has 8 hour battery life. Which it doesn’t. Has never gone longer then 2 1/2 of a hour. Not even that, it does not have any type of noise canceling. Good at phone calls but my main problem with it is that the right one always turns off and both of them are never on at the same time. When they are there on & off. Also the second day they just started making loud noises that wasn’t coming from my phone I have no idea what it was. Save you’re money buy real good quality earbuds these are no good",0
It worked for a week. My husband loved it. And then all of the sudden it won't charge or turn on. It just stopped working.,0
Don't waste your money. To much incorrect information. This should be pulled from circulation all together.,0
Broken when I opened the box. Very disappointed.,0
Flag is printed on only one side of the material. Pay a little more and get something usable.,0
My hubs is just dealing with it but hates it. The side leather trim started peeling one day after use. Pretty disappointing.,0
Not worth it the data cable had to move it in a certain position to make it work i just returned it back.,0
Very cheap items. They arrived broken and I’m very disappointed. I planned to do some meal prep this weekend now I have to make other plans. Some of them are actually cracked.,0
Both top corners cracked and one of the corners actually chipped/fell off. I had used the case for three months.,0
"I ordered this product for a gift, I ordered it on May 16th my mom finally got the product today may 28th and the condition of the products was horrible . The box was not sealed and it was wrapped with lots of plastic. And the pillows were all flat and deflated. I’m very disappointed. It seemed like the product was to big for the box and it was forced inside of it .",0
Probably was me but they're the wrong size headers came with all hardware so we good,0
This item arrived with several cracks from the packaging. I left on the dashboard of my car and it melted. Worst thing I ever saw.,0
I was impressed by the speed with which it arrived. thank you.,0
"My dog ,a super hyper Yorkie, wouldn't eat these. Didn't like the smell of them and probably didn't like the taste. I did manage to get them down him for 3 days to see if it would help him . The process of getting them down him was traumatic for him and me. They did not seem to have any effect on him one way or another , other than the fact that he didn't like them and didn't want to eat them. I ended up throwing them away. Money down the drain. Sorry, I can't recommend them.",0
Worked until the app updated the scanner and bricked it. Still connects Bluetooth but will not connect to the scanner inside the app.,0
"It charged, but fell apart pretty quickly. I bought this after I lost my Garmin charger. I got about 4 uses out of this charger when the USB port completely fell out of the charger. Luckily, I found my old one.",0
I was totally looking forward to using this because I tried the original solution and it was great but it burned my skin because I have sensitive skin but this one Burns and makes my make up look like crap I wouldn’t recommend it at all don’t waste your money,0
"....because I wish I had. Ordered it having seen all the reviews and this was a newer firmware, so figured surely they'd eliminated the issue of the external essentials hard drive wiping all of the data you'd store there. NOPE! Last Western Digital purchase ever, and I've been an otherwise happy customer for over 20 years.",0
Clasps broke off after having for only a few months 😢,0
"When I received this product, I took the tracker out of the package and plugged it in in order to charge it-it never turned on! I did that was suggested, but to no avail!",0
One of the screens arrived shattered already. Doesn’t exactly aspire to me trusting the product.,0
Not rose gold once you put it on. Chilled off within a few days,0
"I have been checking updates since I placed this order, I checked last night before bed, no update, this morning I checked again, it says my bag was delivered on Sat..no way, I checked my door RING video.nothing came, amazon always takes a picture at my door, no picture either..what a sham, along with this company posting their own reviews, which I would not have noticed prior to the phony message from them, no body is going to post about what a great company this place is, they want the bag, on time in good shape, I wouldn’t use this company again, making complaint with amazon",0
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy,0
Trying to figure out how to use it from terrible instructions in broken English. I understand the concepts but have not seen the results.,0
The graphics were not centered and placed more towards the handle than what the Amazon image shows. Only the person drinking can see the graphics. I will be returning the item.,0
I just got these in the mail. Work for like a minute and than gives me the accessory is not supported by this iPhone. I have the iPhone 7. It’s really wack for a deal of two of them,0
"Worthless piece of equipment. Dont waste your money on this crap, splurge and get a good one.",0
I have returned it. Did not like it.,0
"Looked terrible, caused loads of glare, doesn't have adhesive around the edges so it lifts and gets caught on things...not at all worth the money",0
My paper towels kept falling off,0
"Uneven base plates cause the pipes to be not plumb. 1/2"" pipe is good though, however, I needed 1"" or > for my 4"" thick wood cookie table.",0
"I bought the surprise shirt for grandparents, but was sent one for an aunt. I was planning on surprising them with this shirt tomorrow in a cute way, but now I have to postpone the get together until I receive the correct item sent hopefully right this time.",0
"The book is a good quality. However, it is very inaccurate on it’s scientific principles. I have never read such a book before. Nothing in it is accurate.",0
Total rip off. Thought this was a multipack as i am used to but it was a single bar. Very disappointed. First purchase through Amazon in all these years i am not satisfied with.,0
2 out of three stopped working after two weeks.! Threw them all in the trash. Don't waste your money,0
"Case is nice and feels good. Was not able to complete assembly because the kit I received did not include hardware. Purchased several months ago and just got around to putting it together, so unable to receive refund :(",0
No matter what I do all the Quick Connects fittings leak..,0
Sizing runs really small. Order a size or two up. Also really poor quality. Not worth your money.,0
"I was excited to replace my iPad cover with this one as it says in the description that it has ""Ultra strong built-in magnets holds the folded front cover panels firmly to stand the iPad Air 2 and let you enjoy iPad Air 2 without holding it""... well, in my humble opinion there is zero magnetic hold when trying to fold the cover into a stand... once I set it down, it stands up fine... but as soon as I pick it back up the cover unfolds with no-resistance. Otherwise quality seems good.",0
Unfortunately never received product,0
I was happy with it until I got just past the 30 day return window. Now it won’t charge!!!,0
I have not received my order yet!!!!! Please contact me as to where it is!!!!,0
I got this less then a week ago. It doesn’t work. When I went to return it I saw that they don’t accept returns or apply refunds for defective merchandise.,0
I paid $20 for these coins for a Hanukkah party and they showed up in a bubble envelope completely crushed with many ripped open from their foil. With a no return policy I can’t even get a replacement.,0
"Not pleased with this external hard drive. I got it bc I don't have any storage space on my phone. I plugged it in to my iPhone and I have to download the app for it....which requires available storage space, which I don't have! It is also doesn't seem to be quality made. Disappointed overall.",0
"Believe the other reviews, the belt is small and won’t let you start the mower. When you do it will burn the belt in minutes.",0
They don’t even work.,0
This shade sits too low on the lens and it hangs below the top edge of the lens and is crooked! The design is terrible. What made it worse is that it cannot be returned!! Don’t buy and waste your money!,0
I gave this to my husband for our anniversary and some of the keys stopped working within a month.,0
Unfortunately it didn't help our 2 month old sleep.,0
"Out of 4 pairs, 2 of the pairs were low quality sound. One of the 2 had lower volume in the left ear. The other pair was just awful sound. The other 2 were higher quality, but what you'd expect for the price. Unfortunately, I have to return all 4 if I want to get any of my money back for the 2 broken ones. That really stinks.",0
"I have a pair of these gloves from over 10 years ago. That pair is great, you can take a razor sharp knife and run in along the palm and nothing, no cuts, to tears.. Nothing. The new ones are garbage. I took the same knife and lightly ran it across the palm and it cut all the way through the glove. You can tell they are no longer made the same. Save your money and if you bought these DO NOT TRUST them. they offer NO cut resistance at all.",0
It leaves white residue all over dishes! Gross!,0
"Does not charge at all. I have charged it up multiple times and the ears light up but when I plug something in to charge nothing happens. I’ve tried different cables, different devices...nothing.",0
"Nice style, but quality is too low! It simply fell apart! And I just tried it on, didn't have time to wear",0
It's a Sink Hole... Must have been a tax write off!,0
These are advertised as “gold” and the picture appears glittery gold but the ones I received are MUSTARD YELLOW! I purchased them jus tin time for a big cupcake order and do not have time to order new replacements. I will now have to shop around locally to find something that actually matches the event theme. Very upset.,0
"the massager never worked. I missed the 30 day return window, amazon refuses to assist me, so now it's going in the trash. I think they sold me a used one as it didn't even look new. I'm cancelling my amazon prime and shopping in other stores now as you can see what you are buying and it's easier to return. Also, amazon prices are no longer cheaper than in other stores.",0
"I bought this twice. The first time, the longest two cords stopped working within a week or two. I ordered it again and the same thing happened. By the time I contacted amazon, I missed the return window. Amazon needs to ease up on the return window for certain products and stand behind their customers.",0
"I love the pillow in the picture but unfortunately, mine does not look like that. The fabric is yellowish, texture looks different and the colors/ink are blotchy and running into the other colors. I uploaded pics but honestly looks worse in person.",0
Weak/cheap quality! The bristles are not full and very flimsy...doesn’t clean the sides well. I love the nipple cleaner.,0
This would be an awesome blender if the lid were made worth a dang. It's a high enough powered little blender but the lid is so cheaply made that I literally have to keep a hand towel near by to hold the lid on with and it still gets saturated. The first time we used it my 3 year old wanted to help and ended up having hot coffee sprayed all over his hands and arms.,0
I would give a proper review if I ever received my order but I paid for a decal and never received it. Give me my money back.,0
Update to my previous post. The left one stopped working a few days ago and today the right one no longer pairs to any of my devices either. Unfortunately my return window closed Feb 2nd. Very disappointed because be for them failing I really liked them.,0
"I didn't even get it in the mail. I got my other order and this was supposed to be in the package, but it wasn't there.",0
This item is terrible for pregnant woman! Poorly designed! Poor quality! The straps just keep popping off and it’s even big on me. When I adjust it nothing changes. Do not buy.,0
Its very bad. It just peeled my skin but did not remove any dark spots.it made my skin very red :(,0
"Holes all over the dress, terrible!!!",0
"This probably works fine as an IR extender. I bought it on the basis of using it with a OTG breakout cable, to control the normally non-IR equipped FireTV stick. I knew this was an extender and not a USB sensor when I bought it, but seeing as the seller had told another customer confidently ""Yes, it will work with FireTV"" - I thought It'd give it a shot, if nothing else, I could call out the seller's lies. It arrived, tested it, yeah...It's just an IR extender, as expected, no USB data functionality. This is fine, it's advertised as this. What gets it 1-star is the irresponsible, inexperienced, lazy seller telling another customer that it can do what it cannot.",0
I read all of the reviews and thought...YAY something that will help me lose the 10 pounds I need to use. Everyone said it was great and it did nothing to help me lose and I was hardly eating anything!,0
These are really low quality.,0
"I got this backpack Monday night and I was excited about it because I had seen many great reviews for it. I used it for the first time the next day to hold a fair amount of things, and while I was out I noticed this huge rip right down the middle that wasn't there before. I would have been more understanding if I had it for a few months but this was the first time I had put anything into it. I've never been more disappointed in a product before as I have with this backpack. Be very careful when considering purchasing this product.",0
First order delivered was missing; ordered another one and was double charged. Product is thin and pages are even thinner. Disappointing on multiple levels.,0
Amazon did't disclose the return policy of restock fee which is called cheating.,0
Was very disappointed in the quality of this oil. The smell was very unpleasant.,0
Not as described. The large sphere is 2in not 20 like advertised.,0
I enjoyed using a previous larger version of this humidifier but this model (1) is small and doesn't output much mist or meaningfully change room humidity according to an indoor humidity gauge and (2) produces very loud water gurgling and bubbling sounds that kept me awake. The older version did not have these issues.,0
"I bought these candle holders for my baby shower and we were unable to use them because the bolts that came with them were too big and the candle holders were too wobbly to use...this purchase was a waste of money! We tried everything, including glue, and nothing worked!! Nothing stabilized these candle holders.",0
Not reliable and did not chop well. Came apart with second use. Pampered Chef is my all-time favorite with Zyliss coming in second.,0
PINK PART CRACKED AS SOON AS I PUT MY PHONE IN THE CASE,0
These bulbs are not bright at all. I’d guess about 10% as bright as the 7w incandescent bulb I wanted to replace.,0
Tea was not in their INDIVIDUAL boxes,0
I am a stylist and purchased this dryer to use on clients. Within a week the medium tempature stoped working so it only shot cold air and hot air. Then about two weeks after that the hot air came out super hot. I would only recommend this for home use. It is not meant to be used multiple times,0
This shirt is one length all the way around. It does not drape or fall as it looks in the picture. Will be returning!,0
"Didn’t work at all for what I needed. Based on the pictures it looked more flexible but I broke my toe and this was so bulky. Also, I tried freezing it but it only stayed cold for a few minutes. I sent it back. Maybe would work better for a big toe.",0
"After 2 months 1 light or 25% of the order didn't work. Hoped they would work. Now I will have to return all 4 lights just because 1 didn't work. Seller is less than responsive. Asked me to create a movie of the issue, not sure why when it is simply clear that one doesn't light up with motion.",0
Defective- no longer working after 6 months,0
"Worked for about 6 months then just stopped working power will not turn on, speakers started going about a month before it completely went out",0
Very cheap a dollar store item and u can not sweep all material into pan as the edge is not beveled correctly,0
I never got my order,0
This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn’t fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.,0
"A complete and utter piece of garbage. I never damaged, dropped, or neglected this device and by the end of 3 months it is no longer charging. The response time is abysmal when trying to access apps. Then, once accessed, the phone takes it upon itself to kick you OUT of the app. The screen, at times, is completely unresponsive. The memory is virtually gone with just the addition of a few basic apps. Sometimes you get a good product at a good price. Other times, you get exactly what you pay for. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.",0
"Fantastic belt ,love it . This is my second one , the first one was a little small but this one is perfect. I suggest you order one size bigger than your waist size.",0
Super awesome light My 5 year old absolutely loved this light It didn’t last long he got it for his birthday in January it’s February already has trouble with the buttons and doesn’t run bright with plug in eats up batteries even tried recharging batteries Super cool but needs improvement,0
The magnet in the pen fell out shortly after my grandson received it in the mail we didn't find this out until we came to visit after the 30 day return. Poorly made and pretty much useless after only one month.,0
"Ever since we have bought this, I have got back pain sitting on the chair. I cannot sit for more than half an hour on my computer table. I hope that I could return this and get my money back. Working from home has become a pain after buying this chair.",0
We loved these sheets st first but they have proven to be poor quality with rips at seams and areas of obvious wear from very rare use on our bed. Very disappointed. Would NOT recommend.,0
I haven’t had the necklace for more than a day and the lock is broken!!! The necklace is beautiful but I’m honestly disappointed!,0
When i opened the package 2 of them were broken. Very disappointing,0
Mango butter was extremely dry upon delivery.,0
This dress is trash! Not even worthy of a house dress. Literally just pieces of material sewn together. Absolutely no workmanship or quality about it! DO NOT BUY!!!!,0
Item marked delivered but all I received was an unsealed empty bubble pack.,0
These bags break and have a terrible perfume smell to them. I only got them because I couldn’t get to Costco. Not worth it.,0
Screen didn’t work at all,0
Had one of these backpacks for years and time to replace it.... How disappointing the TWO zipper pulls broke less then 30 days after first use. Very disappointing the quality used to be good not anymore. I would not buy this bag or brand in the future.,0
Not good. Absorbs heat like memory foam.,0
Did not fit as advertised.,0
The description said 10 pound bag. There is no way this is 10 pounds. I get the 5 pound bags at the feed store and the 5 pound bag is bigger and heavier. I ordered two bags and I can lift both bags with one hand without trying.,0
The order was three days late (with Prime guaranteed delivery). As I bought it for Christmas present- I had to run in the last minute to Sephora to get an alternative,0
Cheap halogen bulbs that do not come in individual packages. 1 blew out after a day - you get what you pay for! Would not recommend.,0
THIS PRODUCT DID NOT SHOW UP,0
Did NOT fit the car we so carefully measured for. The description and sizing is all wrong. Buy larger than you actually need. Its thin and rips easily.,0
Too small. Very disappointed.,0
Repair looks like crap and they will not take returns! Stay away and don't waste your money here.,0
Pillow do not look like picture,0
Did not work at all.,0
"Thin curtains that are only good for an accent. 56"" wide is if you can stretch to maximum. Minimal light and noise reduction. NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!",0
Never received the code,0
"The steel rule I received is very inaccurate, I ordered it for accurate markings. I never write negative reviews , but this rule is really bad. I checked against calipers and a rule I know is correct. It does make a fair straight edge.",0
When we received the scoreboard it was broken. We called for support and left our number for a call back. 3 days later no call. Terrible service!,0
This product is to small to even fit on my waste lining! Made in China so I assume a person that is normal in US large must be a very 3x person over there. But it is what it is!,0
"The adhesive is only on the edge of the screen, and did not stick in one of the corners. This makes it so my finger can't make contact with the screen, so basically I can't use that corner of my screen. There are also visible lines where the curve is in the screen protector. Just overall a poorly designed product. Don't waste your money on this one.",0
My child did not like at all the flavor. Texture is weird,0
We return the batteries and never revive a refund,0
The seller is not honest... The product has no date and no original box.. Bad.,0
Took a bottle to Prague with me but it just did not seem to do much.,0
Came with 2 pens missing from the box.,0
"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...",0
Came with one detent ball broken,0
This product is not what I ordered and paid for. This was supposed to be a vintage compact mirror (peacock). Highly upset as this was a Christmas gift for my sister!!!,0
I have purchased Orgain products for years. I started out drinking the smooth chocolate and then switched to the vegan chocolate once that was available. I drank 1 to 2 every day. The last products I received tasted horrible. I looked at the ingredients and noticed Orgain changed the formulation. It is absolutely disgusting. Orgain has lost a long time customer.,0
This shirt is not long as the picture indicates. It's just below waist length. Disappointed b/c I am 5'10 and wanted to wear with leggings.,0
Couldnt find these at walmart so i looked on Amazon but later found them at the dollar store. These are obviously overpriced,0
The digital reader would not work when I took it out of the box. So now I've wasted quite a bit of money. Tried to contact seller and no response.,0
I wanted to be able to use both sides at the same time Very dissatisfied with the product,0
"High wasted, does not fit properly. Material not right for that design of the dress does not flow.",0
Stopped working within a year. Would not charge.,0
"The suction cup is the worst quality I’ve seen, I’ve tried multiple times to stick it to my dashboard however any little bump it falls right off. I will definitely return this",0
"This is at least the 4th hose I've tried. I had high hopes, but the metal parts are cheap and it leaks from the connector. The ""fabric??"" of the hose retains water and stays wet for hours or days depending on how hot - or not - the weather is. I do not recommend this product.",0
Sorry but these are a waist of money. Washed my handy one time and they come right off. I even glued them on because they were so cheep and didn’t stay when you put the ring on .,0
I have severe allergies and ordered them because the product info stated they were the softest handkerchief on the market. NOT soft at all...Don’t bother!,0
"Most worthless attempt at saving money I have ever encountered. Three of the exhaust runners either hit or miss-align the intake manifold. It took me more that 15 hours to cut and modify the runners to a point where they had an 1/8 of an inch clearance to the intake. Niw that I have everything assembled, and without touching the down pipe connections, now the downpipe is over a half inch off. To make matters worse, the connecting joint is almost too big for the flares on the downpipe and to top it all of, the supplied hardware is almost am inch and a half too short.",0
"I expect better of Amazon branded products. This cord remains in my car to charge my phone at the end of the day. Purchased in May 2019, dead in August 2019. That seems unreasonable to me.",0
"Not a typical Christmas story. Reindeers have different names, my kids struggled to follow. Also book arrived in poor condition.",0
It is not mush of guide.It kinda sucks I wish I wanted for the official one,0
"I own a Pampered Chef small scoop, but am in between residences so most of my 'stuff' is in storage. I love using these scoops while baking for perfectly portioned cookies. I looked at the OXO scoop and the Pampered Chef scoop and decided to save some money and get the OXO one - I usually have good luck with their products. Not this one. At about peanut butter cookie #30 the lever inside the scoop stopped working. I had to pry the handles apart and re-position the lever in order to do a few more, and then repeat. So... save your sanity and buy the Pampered Chef scoop. It's totally worth it!",0
"Glass was poorly packaged in a *very* thin plastic case in a thin and excessively large bubble mailer, and arrived with both the case and the glass cracked. Returned for refund.",0
Made very cheap!!!! you get what you pay for,0
"I end up spilling a god portion of the charcoal trying to get it in the bag and with that, they don't last. It may cost me more but I'm going to way I use to do it",0
My son was very excited to get this scooter but he has had this scooter for only a month and the handlebar welds and the adjusting bar weld broke as well. Very disappointed. We are unfortunately 3 days over the return policy.,0
"I did not receive this item, what steps to take to have this item verified ?",0
Squeaker broke playing catch in the house in less then 3 minutes. $10.00 for a broken rubber ball is a ripoff. NOT HAPPY. Most squeak toys last us months and we still have some from years ago. Not this. Broke immediately.,0
Horrible product! Does not glide on smoothly and consistently. Will never purchase again. Trashed.,0
Total waste of money. None worked. I try to inflate myself and the balloon immediately deflated so I went to a local balloon store and paid the owner blow up the others I bought the balloon still didn’t inflate...:( I totally do not recommend buying this product waste of money,0
Neither myself or my seven-year-old son was able to make this thing work.,0
The unit I received had damaged thread fitting in the middle. I could only fit 1/3 and it won't go all the way in.,0
"Doesn't cover much of the screen, even with a case on thus doesn't cover the entire touch screen. Also cracked very easily.",0
Does not dry like it is supposed to.,0
The parts did not fit together well. It clogged up and stopped working in less than 24 hours. I returned it.,0
"Picture was incredibly misleading. Shown as a large roll and figured the size would work for my project, then I received the size of a piece of paper.",0
One of the boxes I bought of this cereal had live bugs in it. The other 3 were fine.,0
It's nearly impossible to find a 5 gallon bucket that this seat fits onto. I'd recommend buying the 2 together so that you might get a set that fits.,0
Please do not buy this! I was so excited and I got one for me and my co worker because we freeze in our offices. It's so small and barely even heats up. One of them didn't even work at all!,0
My 10 pound dog shredded the rings within a week of purchasing.,0
"It leaked in the envelope it came in and was almost empty, when I opened It. Which I had read on other reviews, but I thought I'd give it a shot.",0
Shipped wrong tire. Not sure how this can happen when the description is what you’re sending.,0
Charger did not work at all right out of the box. Charged it all day and plugged it into my phone and iPad and nothing.,0
The first 2 days it lit up nicely. Then it just became very dim and doesn’t light up very much. Waste of money,0
Absolute garbage. Arrived defective. Does not work well at all. Terribly glitchy.,0
Why are you still selling an out of date version of the book. To a Ham newbie like myself it is not the easiest to figure out that this was not the current version for testing,0
I’ve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription. When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can’t do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there’s motion and it can’t distinguish. It doesn’t even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really ineffective unless someone hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period. So if you’re comfortable with being stuck with a subscription every year at $100 per camera then it is a decent camera but it’s useless without the subscription. I’m looking into other cameras where I don’t have to have a subscription.,0
Does not charge. Horrible product,0
Ring pops off the flange as soon as torque is applied on screws. Do not buy.,0
Just had the second one break in the last 3 months. The clip on back of the case for the belt is simply not sturdy enough and it's broken in the exact same place every time.,0
Purchases this for my husband and after 3 months it just stopped working will no longer turn on. Being trying to contact support for this item since it has 1 year warranty but it just seems impossible to heb ahold of someone for a replacement.,0
never stayed connected to wifi. Unusable,0
"This is a super cheap, tiny little over priced piece of junk. We returned it. Everything is terrible...the star display is barely visible, you can’t find the tiny buttons to operate the alarm...and especially turn it off when half asleep. The display doesn’t light in the dark, unless you fumble around in the dark for the back light button which only lights for a few seconds. Save your money on this one.",0
Quality was broken after 3rd use. I had a bad experience with this lost voice control.,0
I returned the product to the Vendor in December and have not received my refund yet. I found the product to be difficult to use.,0
Never received this item waiting on a email from someone..,0
"Easy to setup, sounded great for about 6 months then both speakers started crackling. ours are placed under our deck for protection but both still sound terrible now.",0
Larger than expected. Not as pretty as I had hoped.,0
Wow. I want that time back. What a huge BORE!!,0
"This pillow seemed promising for my beck pain based on the 5 star reviews; however, it was not firm enough for me. After requiring a cervical fusion many years ago my neck needs firm support. If this is you, I would not recommend this pillow.",0
Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly. Last but not least was the only product that didnt allow me to return the item although i was able to return other products from this seller. Long story short the seller had to of know this was garbage and blocked the acceptance of returns so i had to call amazon to get this resolved. you get 1 start,0
"The plastic film is very flimsy. The right side always rips no matter how carefully you peel it. For some weird reason, the left side doesn't have this issue. Definitely not the same quality as the photo albums from years ago. I'm returning this.",0
Kind of lame. Thought it would be a hat that I could have worn for our Mexican themed party. But it was just a little floatie thing with no hole for your head. So now it will just have to be our life saving pool device.,0
"I have bought these cloths in the past, but never from Amazon. In contrast to previous purchases, these cloths do not absorb properly after the first wash. After washing they feel more like 'napkins'... very disappointed.",0
When I receive this charger it didn’t work! Tried to contact seller with no luck,0
The box arrived crashed and opened.,0
"Ordered these for my daughter as a Christmas present. When she opened the case 3 of the markers did not have the caps on and were completely dried out. She was very disappointed. She then starting testing all of them on a piece of paper, several of them began to run out of ink very quickly. Not happy with this product, tried to return, however these markets are an unreturnable item.",0
Had for a week and my kid has already ripped 3 of the 4 while on the cup. So disappointed.,0
DO NOT BUY! Device did not work after the first use and the company is ignoring my return request. You want the device to be reliable when you need it. I no longer trust this brand.,0
Product was not as described. Foldable metal spoon was missing despite ordering for the 4 pcs Thermos with it,0
These literally fell apart the first time they were used. The triggers broke the first time one of them was used. Terrible quality--save your money.,0
Arrived for the second time broken.,0
Seal was already broken when I opened the container and it looked like someone had used it.,0
"Not the color advertised, doesn't work well at all.",0
Didnt get our bones at all,0
Broke easily. Very poor quality.,0
I won’t order this you will be wasting your time money and energy,0
Super poor quality. Rough material. However if this is just used for a photo shoot it is cute.,0
This product does not work at all. I have tried it on two of my vehicles and it does not cover light scratches. Waste of money.,0
I never received the product. I want my money back,0
Returned item. Wouldn’t work on my faucet,0
Too small...even for a child. Dissapointed,0
"Item description says ""pack of 3"" but I only received 1",0
Had three weeks and corner grommet ripped out,0
Disappointed. They do not work. I invested in a tool. Still not good,0
"Tried two of these straw cups in this design, and I sent both back. It must be the material used to make the part holding the straw in place that is defective because the green version of the product works fine. I usually enjoy Contigo products; this is the first time I've been disappointed.",0
THE EDGES FRAYED AND FELL APART AFTER ONLY 3 MONTHS USE. THIS PRODUCT IS TOTAL JUNK GIVEN THE PRICING. CANNOT TRUST SPECK ANYMORE.,0
I was very excited about this unit at first. It physically fit what I needed but would not connect to Google pixel 2.,0
Poor quality and nothing like the picture,0
Poor quality. Would not recommend.,0
I never received my order very disappointing!!,0
Some of the undies fit wonderful but other pairs are much smaller. Waste of money!,0
Real makeup. It caused a rash and was difficult to remove.,0
They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing,0
does not support wireless charging like it was advertised to do so,0
I did not order this app. please remove it.,0
This mouse claims to have an internal receiver. It shows a USB port connector but then when it arrived it had a very small piece of paper with a couple of small words stating the USB receiver was built in but I have tried to use this mouse on numerous computers with no luck. What a joke. Of course because I thought the computer I was using was outdated I didn't try returning it before the 10 days they give to request a refund or any return so I'm out the money and have a useless pink car.,0
When I opened the bag the product smelled of chemical. Which isn't very surprising. Thought I just may have to wash it. I held it up and the fabric was awful. Itchy feeling and very heavy. I tried it on anyway once again I thought after wash this may change. Well it felt heavy on and it has no shape. This is not breathable fabric at all. So I did not wash it repackaged it and sent it back. I bought it to hang around the water park or beach with the kids as a cover up. Nope,0
"The product did not work properly, after having it installed the check engine light came back on",0
"These are mediocre at best. Wouldn’t recommend, they don’t look that nice as the picture shows. Looks like a computer print ironed onto a burlap sack. Get what you pay for I guess. It’s ok I’ll use them for garbage bags",0
Smell terrible and neck is coming apart sent back,0
I wasn't please at all it broke a piece fell off very disappointed 😔,0
Wouldn’t keep air the first day of use!!!,0
Downloaded the app after disconnecting my cable provider to watch shows that I enjoy and to see any of them you have to sign in thru your cable provider. Really disappointed!!,0
Product received was not the product ordered. It was a different set without a kettle and their were ants crawling in and out of the box so i didnt even open it but the picture shows a different item with no kettle. I was sent the same thing as a replacement. Fast shipping though.,0
I love the cologne of it ever is actually delivered. They said it arrived 2 weeks ago and that I have to pick it up? Then what is the point of using Amazon is I still have to go pick it up. Amazon you are slipping so bad lately!,0
I never received my item that I bought and it’s saying it was delivered.,0
I NEVER GOT THIS ORDER PLEASE SEND ITS TO ME,0
"October 2017 purchased four (4) cartridges from Vision Supplies - Amazon Marketplace, so I would have when needed and to save shipping cost. Used two over the last couple of years, about one a year, and they worked okay. Tried to use one last week, almost empty after printing 20 labels, but in last one ran out after 40 pages. The plastic a missing on both. Told warranty expired!!!! Who would check every single cartridge when received???? BUYER BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"The adhesive is not put around the entire edges of the cup, so the pasties folds awkwardly leave your breasts appearing oddly shaped and the cup prone to peeling off. Made this completely unwearable.",0
Order the set with 2 cables . Black housing. Only got 1 cable no housing,0
Ordered 4 boxes to stock for staff at work. They all came looking like they got ran over by a truck. They used the worst packing available.,0
When you pour the body wash on the bristles it doesn't foam up. No matter how much you rub it to try and get it to foam it doesn't. Don't buy this if you use body wash because you will be unhappy... Requested Return the very same day after I tried to use it.,0
"This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven’t used them yet, I’m beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They’re only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger.",0
"The figure is pretty solid, but the legs were very weak on mine. Both knee joints have become stuck to the point where if I try to bend them, the lower part of the legs will just break off. Overall, the figure has great detail. My figure just has very weak knee joints.",0
"Wrong sizes listed, belts way to small, and now they are out of stock till after xmas, this was supposed to be a gift.",0
"We have another puzzle like this we love and were excited to add to ours but this is just circles with the smaller shapes painted on. Not what is looks like, no challenge",0
"I can't really write a review as my item does not turn on. I've tried charging with different cords, plugs etc. I apparently missed my return window by 1 day and there's no way for me to contact the seller. I would not recommend!",0
Poor quality stethoscope. I ad to hold the stethoscope in an awkward position to heard heartbeats. I don't have time for extra hands for that.,0
I wish i could give this a zero. I did nit receive the item and had to order another one from another supplier.,0
"Well, I ordered the 100 pack and what came in the mail was silver eyeshadow....Yep, silver women’s eyeshadow...no blades....how does that happen???",0
Not a hundred count and very small,0
Love the look of them but only had them for 3 months an one of the lights burned out:/,0
tried it for 3 weeks every day and it did absolutely nothing for my nails,0
"Not a big fan. I cannot follow the story, because everyone in this show acted too hard. I don't see the characters but only the actors pretending to be whoever was described in the script.",0
The small wrench was worthless. Ended up having to buy a new blender.,0
"This arrived bent way out of shape to the point where it doesn’t sit flat. No hope of actually using it because the cutting boards just slide out of it, because they sit at an angle.",0
Stay away! Our primary reason for purchasing was the mold-resistant claim. Item was used less than 10 times and started to grow mold. Not resistant to mold as advertised! Do not buy unless mold is not a concern.,0
"This product is actually just plain, clear squares. Not what the picture looks like at all 😞",0
"Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.",0
"The delivery took longer than expected. However, I was going to give it a chance but when I opened the box the item looked beat up, one part was broken and another part and one of the hinges was on the wrong side.",0
Stops working after 3 weeks of use. Good thing that I have a backup filter. Please replace.,0
"There were no pins with this clips. The purpose was to use on a bulletin board, but there were no pins included. A complete rip-off and not as advertised. Would not recommend.",0
"Knew in 5 seconds it was not for me. However I completely blame the misleading Title. Shame on you for "" allowing people to believe it's anything close to the real game.",0
past is not enough strong,0
"I don't know if it work or not, b/c the products isn't full its half. I don't understand why it cost so much but i get such a little amount of product. This disappoint me!",0
No liquid was in the bottle,0
6 out of 10 were completely dried out when we received them.,0
After open heart surgery the last thing you need is something that irritates and breaks you out. Don't buy!,0
Out of the box mine leaked all over. Poor quality.,0
It wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I agree with the negative reviews.,0
Didn't fit well and it was not as sturdy as expected,0
"Scam, never came in!",0
terrible quality. cheaply made and looks kitschy! I have wanted to return it from the get-go but they charge for shipping. I have it!,0
"Waste of money, constantly leaking. The lid is loose, the well does not stay seated, and it makes a mess. Every. Time.",0
"For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I’ve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.",0
Cheaply made. It broke during first use and it is not easily returnable.,0
"The fabric has an awful odor, even after washing. Fabric also had a hole in it. Really liked style, though.",0
Got the cutoff in and had it break cutting off an aluminum part. I highly recommend against it,0
"Bought this light January 19, 2018, the topmost light broke within warranty and vendor replaced quickly enough. Second light same issue, yesterday the top most light broke (again) and now out of warranty window. I now own two lights and neither work - DO NOT BUY",0
Did not order; returned,0
This ring is beautiful but turned colors within the first month. Will never buy again,0
Worst purchase on amazon,0
"Ummm.....there is no ink in the cartridges. I'm thinking someone returned this and Amazon regifted it to me. Thanks,",0
I did not receive this order. Tracking said that it was delivered on 6/6 and signed for by Rose. There is NO Rose at this location. I WANT THIS ITEM!!,0
Some kind of cheap conversion/repackaging of the original DVD set. Returned it.,0
Failed out of the box.,0
"So I buy this case thinking, dang rose gold tho. love it! But nah bruh! the screen protector had so many bubbles in it, I immediately threw it away. phone comes with a replacement kick stand. yea the 1st one broke after a week. dropped the phone once and the second kickstand broke! fml! few weeks later....i dropped the phone a second time and the case cracked in half. I gave the case a chance in spite of other bad reviews....dont be an idiot...dont be a rebel, JUST DON'T BUY IT. I've had the case 3 months and now looking for a replacement.",0
"So, i am pretty sure this would be an awesome tool, if you have skip tooth chains or semi skip tooth chains. But i was trying to use it on a full complement chain (tooth, drive, tooth) and it doesn't not lay flat in and grind the rakes. Had to send it back, back to hand files.",0
"We bought one of these. Returned it, bought another. Stupid mistake. I don’t know if we had bad batteries but we ordered two of these. They last a couple of hours and die. Not worth the money, to put new batteries in every couple hours. Not the headache now of taking the tape off the walls. Ugh.",0
"If I could give zero stars I would. I decided to try something new. Usually buy the shin bones. Pup is very soft chewer and She managed to break off a piece ball/joint part and started to choke while chewing it. Bones smells so bad. Just threw all of it away. Like this brand, will only buy shin bones.",0
I had the bag just over a week and the handle already broke!,0
Absolutely horrible vinyl does not stick at all I even had my heat breast up to 450 and it still wouldn't,0
"The product was stale, hard, and expired in October of 2017. What’s not to hate?",0
Had this product since December 26th already can't turn it on and loses its charge really quick.,0
The bottle leaked in the package never got to use it,0
"This strap is very loose fitting, defeats the purpose...no matter how tight I pull it...it does not work and I hv a sizable head...don't t like it..waste of $$$...sending it back...",0
I liked the color but the product don't stay latched or closed after putting any cards in the slots,0
Love the material but I ordered x-large and received xxx-large. I won't be ordering any more from this bunch.,0
"One of the products I received has a hole in it. It is not a problem necessarily, since I could still wear it under something, but still not very disappointing.",0
"Smells like Fish, tastes like Fish. Yuck",0
ordered and never received it.,0
product worked for 30 mins then quit,0
these were nothing like their terrific potato chips from my childhood.,0
"The result was ""Invalid"", so it's money and blood spent for nothing.",0
"The rails fit my handguard just fine. Screws are long enough, inserts are the right size, and the rails have the little circular feature to prevent them from moving around. The problem is that none of my accessories fit the rails. It's like they're too narrow. I tried an Atlas bipod with the quick release and it doesn't tighten up. Neither do my Magpul forward grips. Spend a little extra and get quality rails.",0
Waist is too tight. Doesn't fit. I tried a 44 and that's too large. What I need is a 43 but that is not available. I'm lost.,0
"What a rip off. Even cheap tools should work more than one time. Bought this and used it once, it quit working so I returned it to the manufacturer and got a new one, and guess what? Used it one time and the thing quit just like the first one. Cost me $18.00 to return it. I’ll be damned if I pay postage again.",0
If there has 0 star.i will give it...,0
add makes u think your getting right and left bearings,0
They sent me the watch with a dead battery then wanted me to drive it down to ups for a return!,0
"Very thin, see-through material. The front is much longer than the back.",0
I have never received coffee from Amazon that was punctured and there’s no support for this product!,0
Its says theres 100 and i only received 80 😡😡😡,0
The protective seal was broken when I received this item and a large amount of the contents had spilled out of the container into the plastic bag that the item was in. This was a huge disappointment as you should never use any product when the protective seal has been broken. This caused a major delay in several of my DIY projects that I needed this product for to make several Christmas gifts.,0
"Very disapointed. Phone arrived with damaged microphone. Now I have to mail it back, wait for them to get it, wait for a refund, and then reorder. Very disappointed.",0
"I had high expectations about this product and it was supposed to be a present to my mother. What a disappointment! It never worked, I waisted my money for nothing.",0
"I did not receive the Fitbit Charge HR that I ordered, I got a Fitbit FLEX ,,, and I am very upset and do NOT like not receiving what I ordered",0
Loved it to bad it didn’t fit,0
STOP! Turn around! These are a SCAM! These JUMBO Bully Sticks aren't even as wide as a PIN!!,0
Nothing like the photo. Boo.,0
Zero stars!!!! Scam company DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!,0
When it arrived and I sat it down on the table it was very unbalanced and the feet on it was uneven. Scared to use thinking it’s gonna fall over and burn my house down!,0
The product received does not spray and there is no option to notify seller or return. Says sale is final...guess so when you are selling something that is broken!!!!!,0
I give this product zero stars. The bottle appears very old as if it has been sitting on a shelf in the sun. The expiration date is May 2020.,0
"Not squirrel proof AT ALL. In fact, the squirrels get more mileage out of this thing than the birds do.",0
Grandpa doesn't use it,0
I purchased two pairs of the glasses. By day one the nose pad fell out on both pairs.,0
"It had to be changed very frequently. Even with the filter we had to empty the water and refill because the water would get nasty, the filters put black specs in the water. And it stopped working after 3 months",0
The product is of very poor quality broke just after few uses,0
These are horrible and catch nothing. Nothing.,0
Installation instructions are vague and pins are cheap. It gets the job done but I dont feel it will last very long. Cheaply made. Update: lasted 3 months and I didn't even put the max weight on a single line.,0
"I waited a long time to open this light because there was construction going on at my dock. I stored it in my bedroom away from the elements. I finally tried it out last week, the light worked the first night. Then each use since then it has become less and less bright and less LED cells are lighting up with each power up. I can’t find any info on the company to contact them and get customer service. I am very upset because I was very excited to finally use my light. :(",0
Tried these out and did not charge our X phone nor my daughters iPhone 8,0
I am not impressed at all. No matter how much i fluff it every day I find it to be a very uncomfortable pillow.,0
It smokes and doesn't do well with thicker meats,0
"We bought this for the size and comfort after my husbands knee replacement surgery. On the 3rd day of using it, there is a scorched/burned out spot in the center of the pad! Terrifying that it almost caught on fire!! Don’t know how to go about reporting this...",0
There are terrible! One sock is shorter and tighter than the other. The colors look faded when you put them on. These suck,0
Did not fit very well,0
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I bought it to transfer VHS video to computer as it was advertised to do well. 1) There was nearly no color in my recordings when using this converter. I confirmed it was the converter by directly watching the VHS recording directly on a TV using the same composite outputs, 2) The software is way outdated (9 years in fact), 3) The product cannot be returned. Don't waste your money or your time !!!!!!!!!",0
This phone is not worth it.. the color is washed and the storage is minimal. When I first rcvd the Phone tge charger that came with it did not work so I had to purchase a new charger. Never again will I purchase from third party again. They refused to give me my money back and AMAZON wasn't much help..Sucks,0
I thought this would fill cracks but the material is water thin like paint. It's also very yellow. This product is ineligible for a return so I could not recommend buying it.,0
Paid $25 for 14oz and received an 8oz bottle. Clearly they were hoping I wouldn’t notice? Careless and frustrating. I needed by a certain date and will now have to return it because the product is WRONG. Ridiculous mistake.,0
"When the case is on my phone, my sound gets muffled and the caller can’t hear me at all.",0
"Assembled the unit, tried to use it. The 42mm nor the 40mm Apple 4 watches fit on the stand. There was not enough clearance at the bottom for them to align with the charger. Super bummed, am returning.",0
I received this and it was a piece of thin wood with a picture that was glued on crooked and a thin piece of wire.... sent back ( as instructed) and cannot seem to get seller to even answer that they received the return or anything about my credit!!! Told them to keep money if they needed it that bad.... the only reason for the 1 Star is I wouldn’t be able to let others know about product and seller.,0
These are painful to use,0
Missing the 4 reality cards??,0
"buttons are hard to push display start to change color the lower side of the scale is not uniform (straight), when putting it on a level surface it's shaking hence when brewing espresso it's not showing the accurate measurement",0
I order hot pink. Look at that. That's red. But label is hot pink No return? Omg!!!!!,0
bought this to put on my chevy with r12 system but it did not fit,0
came with the threads not tapped all the way for barrel nut. the handles seem sturdy enough but very poor quality.,0
"The handle keeps coming apart when you use the brush. The pieces don’t screw in, more like they are made to push in. But the inserts don’t seem to be made to keep the pieces together.",0
Didn’t work for me. Did not fit.,0
Total crap wouldn't even plug into the phone the pins were bent before I even tried to use it,0
It was great until it ripped after 3 uses.,0
"Not even good, this screen protector was a joke; the lgv30 have a screen curve around the side and this not even cover it. It peel of easily. Wasted.",0
Product doest work at all anymore.,0
The case seems to be doing a decent job of protecting my phone but it is not very well made. It is difficult to take off and put back on. Overall feels like cheap construction. The kickstand is awful to work with. Once it's open and locked open you have to find the perfect way to close it or it doesn't work. Fingerprint sensor ends up awkwardly deep because the case adds about a quarter inch of thickness to the back. Overall very dissatisfied with this case,0
"This watch was purchased in mid-June. Not even 2 months later it's losing 45 minutes every 4 hours. The indicator boasts a ""full charge"" but still, losing >10 minutes every hour - faulty. Amazon's customer service was A COMPLETE JOKE. I was on the line for over ten minutes (probably longer but my watch runs slow), and got nowhere. Out of warranty.",0
I did not receive the dress I ordered,0
"I like heat but this is a little ridiculous. It is all heat, no ranch flavor at all. Even cutting it with normal ranch the taste is way off.",0
I never received this and I was need to go to the store to buy a replacement,0
I bought 2 and both remotes stopped working first 5 min of useing them,0
Not what I expected at all. It's very heavy and uncomfortable. It's like resting my head on a block,0
"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",0
I hate when I receive a product and it has that notice that tells me it causes cancer in the state of California. Absolutely not. Right into the garbage it went.,0
"Cheap, don’t work. Very dim. Not worth the money.",0
Did not receive it yet. Was unaware it was being shipped from China.,0
All of the boards came damaged.,0
Most were sour and dry. I ended up throwing most of them out. Don’t know if I just got a bad bag but I’m afraid to try again.,0
This item runs extremely small.,0
"What I received with this product was a fancy bottle of BROWN WATER that had a extremely slight scent of vanilla and NO VANILLA TASTE! It tastes like plain water. I tried working with the company as well as Amazon and the company REFUSED to allow a return of this disgraceful excuse for vanilla extract. I would not recommend Blue Cattle Truck in the future for any product. This is absolutely ridiculous that a company would not stand behind its product. So, now I have a $36 bottle of brown water to stand on a shelf and remind me that I was taken advantage of. I would rate the product a ""0"" but it won't allow anything less than one. Thanks a lot, Blue Cattle Truck.",0
I don’t see how this brush made any difference to styling my hair. It’s just a hair brush. Not sure what the hype is about.,0
"Does not stay in place, color is very pale!",0
"As other customer's commented, this shoe does tear apart. Bought them in August for my son who is a cook and he had to throw them out yesterday. The pictures are accurate, they tear on the sides. This shoe won't hold up if you work in food service.",0
The ball is so hard to put together and when you do it pops off instantly you are better off buying a real hamster ball,0
I didn’t even want to give this 1 star! This is a piece of JUNK! Terrible made! I am having. Such a HARD TIME RETURNING THIS PRODUCT! Don’t WASTE YOUR MONEY. It looks like these toys were made for a doll house. Wrongly advertised!,0
Had this product for a little over a week and it stopped working. Never did work when you placed the phone sideways in it...super picky on placement when the phone is upright. Very upset that it doesn’t work after a week of use...DO NOT BUY!,0
"Had this bowl for only 3 months and used it only 6 times when it cracked. I was washing it by hand and heard it crack. This is not a durable product. Perhaps the bowl is too big and makes it weak. I'm going back to glass for my ""go to"" large Mixing bowl- not fancy but durable!",0
Arrived with a missing bolt...,0
This stopped working adter a minth. Would not recommend at all.,0
Love the product but one was broken in box and left a awful mess.,0
"I ordered this phone for my daughter and the ""unlocked dual phone "" is misleading as it came LOCKED & in Chinese!😡",0
"Won’t pull dents out, once pressure is applied, the tool just pops off. Glue that does stick to the car is a pain to get off, will even pull off paint. This this is worthless.",0
"I ordered these screw drivers to remove screw links from my watch. The driver heads just spin in the driver handle without budging the tiny screw. I tried tightening the set screw in the driver handle, but the blade just keep spinning. I cannot recommend buying this driver set.",0
Although I love the case. It is not functional for me. If you turn the case on the side all the oils fall out of place. The purpose of me purchasing this case is so that I could take my oils with me.,0
I was very unhappy with the delivery - I ordered this on December 11 and was supposed to get this before Christmas since it was a Christmas present for my niece and it did not arrive until after Christmas which was very unfortunate.,0
"Worst cable I have had to date for my iphone. It's so stiff if you move it at all while plugged in, it disconnects. I have to carefully plug it in all the way and it doesn't give that really solid click feel, then if disturbed at all it loses connection. I have another Anker Powerline 1 cable and it has been great. Not sure how the II can go backwards. My window to return has closed so I guess I'll contact them directly and see if they will replace with a different cable.",0
Not worth it. Looks like a cartoon Jean painted on leggings.,0
Came all withered no saving,0
Never Received this hot little item,0
Product came broken. The bottom plastic piece looked like it was dropped and was broken on the corner. It taken more time to be returned and replaced so no I have to tape and glue it?!?,0
The book was damaged. There was a deep scratch on the comer and wat looks like sticker damage. This was supose to be a gift and now I can't git it to my niece,0
Does not fit average tv,0
"This is our 4th automatic kwikset lock. Not sure what is going on during manufacturing but they work well for a while then all of a sudden the lock just stops working; beeps for no reason, the keypad doesnt respond when the code is pressed and it randomly goes through a series of locking and unlocking without being triggered. I wish I could return this and get my money back. We replaced the batteries before going on vacation, our pet sitter called us to come home because the lock would not respond when she entered the code. We had to come home from vacation to make sure our dogs were ok! Dangerous and a piece of junk!",0
"Clumpy, creases on my lips, patchy, all in all not worth it. Have to scrub my lips nearly off with makeup remover to get it all off.",0
Not sure but I don't think the infrared light last as long as the regular ones do. Only lasted me a little over a year. I'm not sure how long the warranty is or how to get a replacement.,0
We bought this for light rain for our kids birthday party and it collapsed! Luckily no one was hurt! Then seller wanted me to return the 100lb product and somehow get bent poles in a box and I would have to pay for the return shipping!!!,0
"Shines dimly. broke on next day! Awful, terrible quality. Price is higher than any other. Do not waste time and money on this!",0
"Stop using Amazon Delivery Drivers, they are incompetent and continually damage packages",0
"This product should not even be sold on Amazon. It’s flimsy, cheap and there are no stakes to assemble it properly to set up in yard.",0
The tablet had a slow reaction time. I would touch the screen and the page or item would take at least 2 to 3 seconds to work.,0
Got a screen didn’t worked reorder it and still didn’t work trash screen,0
Very poor quality. This broke after one business trip(soft crushable plastic). The digital screen went black and the disc spins but nothing comes out. The sonic quality is also poor although it has EQ options. I miss my old Sony original from 1991. This isn’t even close.,0
"This fabric was so disappointing and it looked completely different in person, it's not rose gold and its dull. How can sequins be dull, it's an oxymoron!!",0
Do not waste your money on this product! The tie mechanism is defective.,0
"Shocked when I opened the box to find that the tool was broken, most of the attachments were completely used up or broken. This thing looked like it had been used for years, then put back into the box, sawdust and all then shipped to me. Check out the pictures! I'm sure it's a great tool, but I'll never know...",0
"did not work, spit out fog oil ,must have got a bad one",0
Not the best product for the money,0
"I used it only twice and when the sidewalk ended, it went out and didn't turn on anymore. I did not buy it. Do not throw your money",0
"The water didn't get very hot and ran through quickly, making a weak cup of coffee. After having it a little more than a month, only half of the water would go through, basically making a mini cup of weak coffee. Amazon said we had it more than a month so we would have to contact the company. The company said it was still under warrantee but we would have to pay $11 shipping and handling to get a new one. $11 is a lot of money considering we don't know if the second one will break after a short time. So now we have a $40 piece of garbage and will be replacing it with a different brand. Very dissatisfied!",0
"Wrong color suspension and quality compared to picture. Picture shows different suspension, color. Very disappointed.",0
Arrived frozen solid. Been in the house for 2 hours and still frozen. Brought into house 7 min after delivered. Probably ruined. Suspect package was in delivery vehicle overnight. Waste of money.,0
Cheap material. Broke after a couple month of usage and I emailed the company about it and never got a response. There are much better phone cases out there so don't waste your time with this one.,0
"I put this on my nose as directed twice a day rubbing it in for 2 minutes. The skin on my nose reddened and went completely raw. I was pretty taken aback. I had a well healed scar from falling into barb wire from years ago. Not only did this product not work but I almost ended up at the dermatologist's office, however, putting aqua-for and a bandaid over the area finally calmed it down after about a week. My nose is still reddened however but hoping this goes away soon.",0
Bought this gauge half way worked. It would freeze and then drop real fast. I turned key off and back on and it would show different readings. The sender was good. I bought a sierra and works like a charm.,0
"These are terrible, threw mine in the garbage. Every couple of songs it makes a skipping sound like a CD player and you have to turn off and back on the headphones to make it stop. Dont waste your money on these.",0
Totally got scammed. Worked for 10min. Thanks,0
I bought this for my sons birthday party and one hour into it I noticed a tear in the back of his shirt where his arm is. I was so embarrassed when someone asked me about it and had to change him midway through his party. It was brand new never been used and tore within an hour.,0
"One of them worked, the other one didn't. There's no apparent damage, it just won't work on multiple phones and with multiple wall ports.",0
The antiglare is just a low quality opaque piece of plastic. hard to see thru it,0
"I am unable to use these on any of my doors! They do not fit. My doors have frames, and the doors in the pictures do not have them. Will never use these.",0
It is a horrible book.,0
These are not soft or flexible on the ear at all! Worried I will damage my ear using them and they don't work to massage the ear as it says either!,0
Poor quality screw base. Not made to US specs for standard household bulbs.,0
Did not receive I want a refund,0
cheap quality doesnt work,0
The glow powder claims to be kiln fired in; that’s a LIE. The glow powder came off onto EVERYTHING in the fish tanks. One betta Fish survived the trauma. The other one died shortly after this chaos.,0
"The band was clunky and uncomfortable to begin with. I managed to alter it to fit, however it remained awkward and too large. I should have ordered something less masculine. I was managing, though. Until about three weeks in, when the band completely broke. One component of the band apparently simply fell out, and the band fell to pieces. I was disappointed.",0
Worst product I’ve bought,0
I think it was an Out of the Box Failure. Too cheap to send back. Solved my problem another way.,0
"Product was diluted!!! I had used this as a hand soap at a friends house and REALLY liked it. She’d purchased her bottle from homegoods. So I ordered mine on Amazon. I was so totally disappointed and felt a little insulted. The package and scent were as I remembered and liked, but the product was DEFINITELY watered down. Felt like what you’d do to dish soap when you come to the end and you rinse the bottle out to get the last drop. I couldn’t believe it. Maybe try another seller if you like this soap!!",0
Not worth your time. PASS.,0
Was not as advertised. Is not 6” insertable.,0
"The faucet worked well for the first 3-6 months it was installed but them developed a pin-hole leak in the hose (the main part of the faucet). We contacted the seller and they said they would send a replacement part but sent sprayer head. We have tried several more times to contact them but they will not respond. Now we have been 2-3 months without a faucet for our island sink. The lifetime warranty is false! Go with Delta, Kohler, Moen or any other brand that stands behind their product. Terrible!",0
"Was really looking forward to this product due to the reviews but when the package arrived, the jar was in pieces and marmalade was everywhere. They didn’t even put the product in a box; just the standard amazon shipping package. Disappointed",0
"Absolutely no protection on the phone, flimsy plastic material, terrible quality. This is the bulkiest case I have ever held and it only fits two cards at maximum - no squeezing a third at all. Very expensive and obviously cost very little to produce. Stay away~!",0
I never got my order... Definitely the worst saler on Amazon.,0
DON'T!!! Mine stopped playing 3 days after return deadline ended.,0
Almost all of the packages were hard to chew so I didn't bother opening the rest :(,0
I dislike this product it didnt hold water came smash in a bag and i just thow it in the trash,0
Very poor material brooke in two days. Not worthy. What a waste and my daughter was looking forward to that.,0
"they're super cute.... but not durable at all. took them out of the packaging and already flowers were falling off. put batteries in them and it was only a week or two before the lights altogether stopped working (and no, it wasn't because the batteries ran out of juice).",0
Arrived completely melted! Would not recommend!,0
It was great the first few weeks. Now the bag is falling apart. Received august 20. Today is october 2 and bag is now coming apart . Only ever had 1 racket and 1 pair of shoes kept in there. Still looks new. *Zipper broke *Handle broke *Ripped near zipper area can't close.,0
Only lasted 2 months!,0
"Doesn’t work! You can hear the battery moving back and forth and it feels cheaply made, wouldn’t recommend to anyone would actually tell them not to buy from them.",0
The closures seems like they would open unintentionally very easily. They don't seem to seal well.,0
"Product does not include instructions, but turning the shaft changes the frequency. Does nothing to quiet the dog next door, but when I blow it in the house, my wife barks.",0
"I purchased this headset for my grandson on March 12, 2018. They stopped working on March 26, 2018. He could hear the person on the other end but they were unable to hear him.",0
I opened my package to discover it had opened and spilled everywhere! I went to return the item as defective and found out it isn’t returnable. Now I have 3 lbs of gum balls I have to throw out because I have no idea on how sanitary the boxes are and where they have been.,0
Not very happy with this product. Upon opening the package I was hit with an unpleasant chemical smell. Had to air it out for a couple of hours before I let my daughter play with it. She's only had it for a total of 3 days and it's already torn at the neck seam. The black of the penguin smudges to the white. Definitely not worth $8.,0
This did not work AT ALL on my puffy under eye. I promptly returned it.,0
These are beautiful glasses. We ordered them specifically to drink gin drinks. They are the perfect size and look really classy. We used them a couple of times and hand washed them each time. The third time I hand washed them and the bowl part of one of them totally shattered in my hand while I was drying it. I was really careful with them but still this happened. Such a shame. Really liked them until that happened. I was going to order more but I'm nervous the same thing will happen again.,0
None of them worked.,0
"It’s disappointing opening the box getting excited to see your package arrive, only to find that only 4 sets were delivered not the 6 you were promised.",0
Each one I put on bubbled,0
"Although this is a work of fiction, I am troubled that the theology would give someone a very wrong idea of Christianity. I was so worried about leading someone astray that, for the first time in my life, I trashed a book rather than reselling or giving it away. This is fiction, this is fiction, this is fiction.",0
"These are very fragile. I have a cat who is a bit rambunctious and sometimes knocks my phone off my nightstand while it's plugged in. He managed to break all of these the first or second time he did that. I'm sure they're fine if you're very careful with them, but if whatever you're charging falls off a table or nightstand while plugged in, these are very likely to stop working quickly.",0
The connect to the phone basically fail and the case would not reliably charge the phone within 4 months. Tried contacting the seller and received no response. I would NOT recommend the product .,0
The belt started to slip after a month,0
I tried these with 2 two different pens. The ink does not flow and the cartridge dries out after a few days.,0
Book was a mess when I got it. Returned it the next day and was only refunded 1/3 of what I paid!!!!,0
Yeah it’s great to have a remote for PS Vue but every time you go to use it you have to press either the TV or PS4 button. More irritating than helpful. Such a buzz kill.,0
Waste of money smfh sooo upset,0
"This movie took to long to get to the point. A lot of nothing happens for an hour, by that time I was bored.",0
"Don't waste your money, much too thin to protect your phone",0
my problem with the product is the fit. I have a large head and it is too tight everywhere and the neck just doesnt feel right. I want to pull it down but then my nose has no room. I can't use it because of the poor fit.,0
"I had to return them. They said they worked to recharge dog bark collars, but neither cord plugged into different USB outlets charged the collar.",0
This is a poorly made piece that was falling apart as we assembled it - some of the elements looked closer to cardboard than any wood you can imagine. I can foresee that it will be donated or thrown away in the next few months or even weeks.,0
"Yeah, that's about it. The nipple pieces are so tiny that at best, they are fit for feeding baby mice or maybe baby gerbils. I can't use them for my two little, five week old puppies. They weigh 1.3 and 1.5 pounds respectively, and this teensy nipple is too small that they would even recognize this as something from which to suckle. Other use I can think of for these would be a 5 - 10 year old girl, who wants to bottle feed her dolls. She would love these! I can't imagine how the makers can claim that all professional nurses use them for new born animals. I don't believe it! I am going to buy some real baby bottles with some real nipples.",0
Only used for a week,0
This is crap. Very thin. Lasted one day,0
Warped. Does not sit flat on desk.,0
Upsetting...these only work if you have a thin phone and or no phone case at all. I'm not going to take my phone's case (which isn't thick) off Everytime I want to use the stand. Wast of money. Don't buy if you use a phone case to protect your phone it's too thin.,0
The description of this product indicated that it would have a cosmetic flaw only. This pendant is missing the socket. There is no place to put the light bulb.,0
"why give me a date for a month then when its suppose to ship, its running late",0
"I purchased this to replace the screen on my friend’s 6s plus. I’ve replaced numerous iPhone screens in the past. This one, as soon as I powered on the phone, had a cluster of dead pixels in the middle of the display. Also, the home button was completely non-functional. I’m not just talking about TouchID. I mean the home button was completely dead. I tried moving a functional home button to the new display and it didn’t work either so there was obviously an issue with something in the replacement part. Fortunately, Amazon offered me a refund so I’ve purchased a different replacement part that will hopefully work better.",0
Started falling apart in three months.,0
"When using the bag for the first time, when it comes down from the baggage conveyor, the baggage handler packs the entire bag in a plastic bag. The zipper between the bottom compartment and the top has been separated. Fortunately I didn't lose anything. But I have to buy a new suitcase for my next trip. By the way, the weight when filling is 23 pounds. Therefore, I did not overfill it.",0
I canceled this order and reordered using a different mailing address because this was a gift and it came to my address and does not have a packaging slip where I can send it back....disappointed. Also the mailing envelope it came in was torn in two places.,0
Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it's more or less the design of the applicator I don't really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that's just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL,0
"Arrived busted in 2 corners and the box was ripped, looked like they were reselling a returned product.",0
never received my order,0
The screen protector moves around and doesn't stick so it pops off or slides around,0
Worst purchase ever...bag is way too small cannot hold anything in it First time I opened the bag the bow at front came off in my hands Wasted my money,0
"Product was not to my liking seemed diluted to other brands I have used, will not buy again. Sorry",0
The rating should be zero because I never received my item. It was supposed to have been delivered but I never got it.,0
Ordered this for a Santa present and Christmas Eve noticed it came broken!,0
"Garbage. Shipped damaged. When I tried to return it they wanted me to pay for the return shipping. Currently dealing with amazon customer service - which is my first attempt in years, and even they are making it hard. Apparently this is the 3rd party seller - so amazon customer service doesn’t apply. Wow. Sadly I paid amazon.",0
Did nothing and was nothing,0
These flavors are blah! I’ve had these same flavors from different brands and enjoyed them but these are gross.,0
I ordered Copic Bold Primaries and got Copic Ciao Rainbow instead. Amazon gave me a full refund but still annoying to have to reorder and hopefully get the right item.,0
One of the 5 cords received is already broken. The other 4 have hardly been used. The one that’s broken has only been used moderately and it already stopped charging.,0
Do not order from this vendor. They sent me the incorrect size twice. Too expensive to have such dismal attention to detail.,0
Worst iPhone charger ever. The charger head broke after used for 5 Times. Terrible quality.,0
"I followed the instructions but the chalk goes on gritty and chunky, and looks nothing like the photos. A giant waste.",0
It did not work when I received it the packaging was all wet I'm not sure how it got that way but it must have been in transit because it was delivered inside and picked up immediately as we really needed it for our RV. I ordered one from a different supplier and the unit works well but the one I received from Amazon never worked,0
"The first night of using this air conditioner it stopped working (in the middle of the night) and the red light went on, indicating that the water tank is full. I removed 3 buckets of water (on the 1st night of operation!). After turning it on, AC stopped working in 1 hour again!!! And I removed 1 bucket of water again!!! So going forward, the AC stopped working every single hour. From what I see this AC has a totally faulty water evaporation system. Don't tell me that the company is not aware of it! This AC should be removed from production and sales and faulty system corrected. For $500 I got myself a trash and a headache, instead of peace and calm and comfortable nights what I was hoping for. If you ever think about this crap, you have been warned.",0
"I have never had a bad shipment of these and my yard is full of them, this last shipment has one strand that won't work at all and the other strand only works on flash, i'm definitely afraid to order any more of them.",0
Tested this water with ph drops and it is not alkaline but acidic,0
It said that was shipped but I didn't get anything,0
This was a super difficult read with no characters that were of value. I found it not up to his usual quality.,0
So liquid that it poured! Very disappointed!!!,0
If does not always work for some reason.,0
Disappointed. There's this pink discoloration all over the back of the shirt. It's like someone already wore this,0
"Recieved the item with obviously re-closed packaging. Box was scuffed & dirty on outside and small dark marking on the actual thermometer. Then, once I downloaded the app, created my account, confirmed account via email, I still couldn't even log into the app to use the product. Pointless!",0
Took a chance on a warehouse deal and lost. It said like new minor cosmetic on front turned out to be stickers on front and a broken speaker Connection in the back making Channel 1 useless.,0
relieved itching in ear for a few seconds.,0
Glass was broken had to ship it back waiting on the new one to be here tomorrow hopefully not not broken.,0
"The width and the depth were opposite of what it said, so they did not fit my cabinet.",0
I never got this when it said I did????,0
I received this in the mail and it was MISSING. The bag is ripped open and there is no bracelet to be found....,0
Brought this as an Christmas gift for my son. Assembly was pretty easy I liked how sturdy the materials were. However it stopped working the first day he played with it. Was very disappointed because the cars on the track would stop moving and it was times when they would get off track. I would not recommend this product at all.,0
It was working fine for the first 3 months after purchased. But after that I need to change battery every month and now it does not dispense any more soap. That is a design flaw where the soap will dry up and block the soap dispense hole.,0
Product was never received. Seller contacted and still no product.,0
I was so happy I finally found venison and elk sausage well what a disappointment. Save your money they all taste the same and it is not a lot of taste either would not even pay 2 dollars each for these,0
BINDING FALLS APART: Throw it away!! I cannot imagine why they would bother to produce such a poor quality product for such HARD WORKING professionals!! This book is used every day- almost every hour. It fell apart instantly with use the first week. so sad...,0
I never should've ordered this for my front porch steps. It had NO Adhesion and was a BIG disappointment.,0
This blade worked well for a little while (had this item for a little over a month) and then it snapped off as I was opening a box with it. Would not recommend.,0
"Very cheaply made, its not worth your money, ours came already broken and looks like it's been played with, retaped, resold.",0
"Awful product. I tried different doses (2 to 6 sprays) when I needed a boost in energy. I did not get any positive result, neither mental nor physical. All I got from this product were heart palpitations.",0
Does not fit as the description says!,0
Stupid story line & beyond boring!,0
Photo sensor to sensitive. Lights turn on and turn off herself.,0
"Did not open the bottle,too late to return to seller.",0
"After having the trampoline for only a couple months, our trampoline got a good size tear in it.",0
Product broke in less that 3 months!! The speakers are great but the manufacturing not so great !,0
Didn't notice a difference.,0
"I paid over $50.00 for this to arrive without the battery pack and a broken zipper! When I asked about the battery pack, I was told ""they would look to see if they had a spare one."" They never followed through. Never would I recommend purchasing from this company!!!! I didn't want to give them even 1 star!",0
"Very disappointed in the quality of this product! For the amount I paid, not what it looks like in the pictures. And the box was squished on one whole side also.",0
"I know this tracker is several years old and the technology has improved a lot since then, so I was really not expecting much. I just needed a simple step tracker that clips onto my clothing and syncs with my phone, and the price was incredibly low so I figured why not. I received this tracker on Friday, and by Monday it has stopped syncing with my phone. It worked for 2 days. I have tried troubleshooting this error but cannot fix the problem. I don't know if its the app or the tracker, but either way it was a waste. I also felt like it was not counting enough steps when it was working. Fortunately I ended up getting it for free due to a delivery error, but I'm still annoyed that it is such a piece of garbage.",0
I like this swim suit but it fits really small. I am a size 14 and per reviews that's what I ordered. It runs really small. Also a lot of mesh in the back and on the sides of this suit. Don't like that. its going back....sad,0
Tip broke after a few weeks of use.,0
One of them broke as soon as it was opened.,0
This rice is from the ice age. It tastes ghastly and revolting. I threw the rest away and I'm sure not even the ants will like it. It seems to be leftovers from Neanderthals which might add some archeological value to it.,0
"The speaker has a great sound and size is perfect for traveling. after around 6 months the speaker drops connection constantly and cannot be returned. it is not a cheap device and the brand is known for quality in general, but very disappointed now.",0
"This was not like the name brand polymer clays I am used to working with. This is much to plasticky feeling, hard to work with, it won’t soften up even the slightest bit with the heat from my hands like the name brand polymers. It was difficult to mold, roll, and impossible to create anything halfway decent looking. This is certainly a case of “you get what you pay for” Stick to the name brand if you want this for anything other than for a kid to mess around with. I am highly disappointed in everything except for the case it came in.",0
Charging port broke when I got it out of the box to charge it. It pushed inside and no way to get it out. Waste of time.,0
"Broke, started to tear immediately when pulling weight",0
Save your money this is lame and not fun at all. My kids and pimple popping addicted wife do not even like it.,0
Very fake looking. I sent back.,0
Bought it on December broke on me on February. Got an E1 error meaning hardware fault. Second time I bought this only to break a couple months later. Buyer beware.,0
I'm sure its a lovely book.. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. Not very please with the looks of it.,0
"Other reviews have claimed that this product has failed after a short period of time, and this was my experience as well. Mine no longer responds to X10 commands or the on/off buttons after less than 6 months. I requested a repair or replacement from Texas Home Automation (the Amazon seller), but they informed me that it was past the 120 day warranty period.",0
Plates won’t snap in. The keep falling out no master how hard you push. Leaks every where. Handle won’t snap shut. It’s good difficult to use. It’s not like my d sandwich maker I used in college. Only reason I wanted another one-the simple ease of making sandwiches. But this is more headache than worth it. I’m cleaning the mess it’s made.,0
The time display stopped working after 3 months. Can now see only bottom half of numbers. Don't buy.,0
It will not turn on. It was a gift and the person called and said it does not work. It won't turn on. I would like to send back and get either another or my money back.,0
I should've checked reviews before buying these headphones. They barely lasted 2 weeks compared to my original android headphones which lasted me close to two years before one ear died. DO NOT BUY,0
"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."" HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards. (Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually ""baffle"" squirrels!)",0
Doesn’t look anything like the case.. brought for a gift and I don’t even want to give it to her,0
I don’t like it because i ordered twice they sent me the one expired. No good .I don’t want to buy anymore.,0
Did not seem to slow mice down. Plugged them in and mice still kept coming. Did absolutely nothing to stop,0
"I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS PRODUCT BUT THE RETURN WINDOW RAN OUT. The liner comes folded and does not lay flat. I thought that if I left it out, the material would eventually relax and become flat. It has been out a week and it I still all rippled. Why would the manufacturer not ship it in a tube or wrapped around a tube!!!! This liner is useless. What a joke. Do not buy.",0
"Not only was the product poorly packaged, it did not work and made a horrible grinding noise when turned on. To make matters worse, I followed ALL return instructions and still have not been issued my refund! Would give zero stars if I could.",0
"The battery life is terrible compared to earlier versions, an all day reading episode uses it up. It is not something I could count on for a long trip without power nearby. Also, it often goes back several pages quickly because my hand gets near the left edge. I regret buying this version.",0
They have no clue what there even doing waste of money.,0
This paper I believe is a replacement for a glossy cannon paper I used to buy. This paper isn't as heavy as the previous edition and won't stay straight in my Canon pro-100 printer.,0
It broke after a couple of days used in the water,0
Didn't work well for me. Lips still dry and peeling,0
Terrible color and texture. Trying to salvage it as a blush,0
Movie freezes up. Can't watch it. Doesn't work,0
If I could give a zero I would. I have emailed this company 3 times that I haven't receive my lunch bag. They told me the post office left a note of an attempted delivery. I've never received a slip. I've called the post office and they dont have my bag. The emails tells me to keep calling the post office. O just want my lunch bag or my money back.,0
"The teapot came with many visible scratches on it. After repeated efforts to contact the seller, they have simply ignored requests to replace or refund money.",0
they changed the recipe and now they are dry and crumbly,0
"I wanted to switch from supermarket ""natural"" kibble to 100% organic, but my cat hates this stuff. It costed a lot, so I'm very disappointed.",0
This company went from five to negative zero stars.,0
This pen is garbage just got them they’re already skipping this is the first time writing with them not to mention that they are so ugly they are not full like they are in the picture they have no feathers,0
"Cheap material/fabric. Won't survive one wash. Asian size that will only fit a Doll not a Human. Once again sellers are Amazon listing clothes as American sizes but not referencing that the product is from China or Asian Country. Don;t buy this, you will be wasting your time to mail it back.",0
"I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn’t stretch, it’s not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it’s stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!",0
The cords are too short. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks.,0
"Product arrived with scratches on it prior to even removing it from its packaging, then when I tried to use it there was no connection. This spliter does not do what it is intended to do. Interesting that all of the 5 star reviews are from unverified purchases.. 🤔",0
This review is not for the product its for the seller. There was a mistake on there part and I didn't receive the right product . Would have been too much of a hassle for me to return. Gave the tablet form vitamins to a friend. This product does work.,0
"Dislike, it doesn’t look like the 5th edition show on the picture. I WANTED THE 5th edition",0
Very poorly packaged. The glasses banged each other. Should have been bubble wrapped. So bummed that I can’t use these for a party tonight!,0
Material looks and feels very cheap.,0
Whoever packed this does not care or has a lot to learn about dunnage.,0
My daughter said they shocked her inside her ear.,0
The nozzle broke after a week and I reached out to the seller but got no response,0
Wasn’t happy how it bent my hats & also left a line on the bill from the plastic,0
i never received my package but it shows it was delivered.,0
The cover felt soft enough after washing. I followed directions exactly as stated. It leaked the first night and every night since. I am disappointed. It is a good thing that I used a different cover underneath it just in case.,0
No space bag alot smaller than it looks in picture,0
Did not come with the wand,0
This thing is angled the wrong way. It makes you bend your wrist up in an unnatural position which is very fatiguing. Sent it back after using for less than an hour.,0
This printer is horrible. It's way too complicated and is constantly giving error messages. The printer drawer and output drawers are very cheaply made. We've had this printer for less than 6 months and have only been able to print many 5 items since it's constantly giving us a new error message. Once we try to correct the error message by doing exactly what it states it gives us the same error. Very frustrating.,0
"We got an old product or expired product which it did not work for us. We have filed a complain with the Amazon and the seller so far we have not resolve this problem. We mixed the product as recommended on the container. The product was very hard to use it was very sticky. Then it became like a real glue after half hour as shown in the figure above.. The seller told us that you must leave the lid open after you mix it which was not on the instruction. This does not make a sense. We believe that we have received an old product which was sitting in the shelf for more than a year. The shelf life of the product is one year. The shelf life of the oriduct was missing on the container. There was no date on the container when it was made, and when it expire. This is very important. We have filed a dispute against the seller.",0
"Cable tester defective right out of the box. Stuck flashing on port one as others have stated. Tested on known good cables, still stuck flashing on port one. Buyer beware, you get what you pay for.",0
I bought this from Liberty Imports and it was not secured in the packaging and did not work. I returned it for another one and with the same result. The second one had markings on the car that suggest it was used before.,0
I like it is solid and also easy to apply on my baby. Also the ingredients are organic and natural. However after I start using them. I realized it have something hard plastic SHARP in the middle of the stick!! I almost make a big scratch on my baby's face! The design of this stick is TERRIBLE!,0
Zipper broke right after return period expired. A nice bag but now useless.,0
Product does not stick well came loose and less than 24 hours after installing did everything correctly but just didn’t work,0
colors were misleading as well as the texture,0
"Absolutely terrible. I ordered these expecting a quality product for 10 dollars. They were shipped in an envelope inside of another envelope all just banging against each other while on their way to me from the seller. 3 of them are broken internally, they make a rattle noise as the ones that work do not. I will be requesting a refund for these and filing a complaint with Amazon. Don't purchase unless you like to buy broken/damaged goods. Completely worthless.",0
Arrived broken. Son was not happy at all,0
Not bright enough. Very disappointed.,0
Extremely thin backing paper. Poor adhesive. Overall poor quality. Do not waste your money,0
Pure sugar Do not buy this brand,0
Stopped working after four weeks. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.,0
"This door hanger is cute and all but its a bit small. My main complain is that, i cannot close my door because the bar latched to the door isnt flat enough.. Worst nightmare.",0
Very drying on my hair .,0
Had Western Digital in all my builds and they've been great. Decided to try the Fire Cuda and it failed two weeks in and I lost so much data. Never again!!,0
"I received girls instead of boys that I ordered. I returned and ordered it again, hopefully I get the correct one.",0
Did not spray a mist; only a stream and no directions provided to try to fix the problem.,0
Horrible packing! Chips were completely crushed!,0
I had to return mine because the +/- for the flame did not function n the least.,0
"Purchased this case in June. It cracked about a month ago and now it completely snapped. There was no outside influence kn the case. Since being installed it had never been dropped or attempted to remove. It's a nice case, too bad it's useless when it doesn't protect the product.",0
So small can't even see it in my garage i though was a lil bigger,0
Never received item and smile amazon has no way on their website to refund orders that were never received.,0
Only lasted 8 months and it stopped working. I don’t drink enough wine to wear it out in only 8 months. Worked great when it worked.,0
I did not get my package from poster,0
all of the cards are from cheap paper,0
"This product is great when it works, which is RARELY. We have attempted to record multiple soccer games and lacrosse games and have ended up with some videos of the grass, a bunch of 0 byte video clips on the card, and that is about it. For a $700 product I would expect it to work. The memory card is one of their suggested cards, and we have applied all the product updates that were available. We have used it for streaming which worked, but that would be all I would recommend it for at this point. We have other friends that have them and all have had issues with theirs as well. Nothing like thinking you are recording your kids playing sports to come home and have NOTHING.",0
"I REALLY wanted to love this protein powder, but it gave me terrible gas and the flavor wasn't very good. I tried using it to make chia pudding as well and it came out very bitter.",0
Only 6 of the 12 lights were included...,0
"A lot of the capsules were empty, dust everywhere.",0
I tried everything to get my dogs to use this. Never happened. I would like to return it.,0
Not enough room for your coffee cup. Not big enough for a cell phone. Not the best material I would not recommend the bag it's not good.,0
"The dress looked nothing like the picture! It was short, tight and cheap looking and fitting!",0
"This was not what I thought...patches are very hard, not flexible..uncomfortable to wear...heat impact was too warm.....well packaged...",0

"this started out to be a great knife for being out on the water ... until it went into the water ... it began to rust right away; wow, what a disappointment and waist of money ... if wanting something to be used while in the water that will not rust as soon as it touches the water, then look elsewhere",0
"I hate to give this product one star when it probably deserves 5. My dog has chronic itchy skin and I had high hopes that this product would be the answer to his skin issues. I'll never know because he won't eat them. At first I gave them to him as a treat. He sniffed it and walked away. I crumbled just one up in his food but he was onto me and wouldn't touch it. So, sadly, the search continues.",0
"The directions make no sense, could not even put it together as all of the parts did not come with it either",0
"Well, the mother card came damaged and I can not return it because I'm from another country and the cost of sending the package is greater than the price of the card, so it's not worth it. The card is beautiful and comes well packaged, but unfortunately it came damaged from the factory, it does not turn on or the LED lights that it has on the part of the external connectors. The criticism is for those people who buy the items internationally, bear in mind that they can lose their money if it is damaged and the cost of returning it to amazon is much higher than the price of the item.",0
"The screen protector doesn't stick to the screen. Followed the directions , the first one didn't really stick on the top just wouldn't stay ,had rainbow effect, this phone is new, the second one lasted three days before popping loose on top, the screen cleaner wipes that came with wet dried out for the second one, so used my lens cleaner, how do you get them to stick, this is the second time that I have contacted about this.",0
"It doesn't tract the steps accurately, I did several tests and it failed in most of them, besides, I need to take it out when taking a shower because isn't wanted proof.",0
"swimsuit indicated that it was Prime and consistently shipping dates kept getting pushed out to a later time. The swimsuit ended p coming after my vacation which was completely disappointing and while contacting Amazon and Cupshe, nobody could give me a proper update as to when I would receive it.",0
"This product was supposed to ship in 2 days with prime. It took 2 weeks, ended up not being delivered on the updated date they said it would be, then because the package was left on a delivery day other than what was expected based on their updated information, it was stolen off the front porch as we weren’t expecting a delivery that day. Amazon refunded and I will buy from a different seller.",0
I did not purchase this item and why was the money drafted out of my account,0
"I purchased this trimmer because the one I've had for several years just died. I use a trimmer to trim my husband's unruly eyebrows! The first and only time I tried to use this tool, it twisted and pulled the hair out, instead of cutting it. I threw it in the garbage and used my scissors instead. This is a cheap piece of trash!! Don't waste your time and money, choose another brand!! It is truly rated ZERO!",0
"The package arrived in the town just down the road from me, and they are holding it for 3 more days for reasons unknown, when I could have picked it up from there myself and had it yesterday, it's so annoying",0
They did nothing what the description said. I wore them not even 10 minutes and the began to fog up.,0
Stopped working after less than 2 weeks,0
"I bought a second unit after my first one failed. Second one doing same as the first one now. Black or white screen on back and will not turn on or record just shows red light on. tried to reset it and nothing. picture quality is awesome when it works, problem is it doesn't work for long. :(",0
"it does not work, only one hearing aid works at a time",0
Absolute WORST pads ever!!!!!!!! Terrible!!!! They fall apart when you open one up. Huge mess! It should be a crime that anything so crappy can be made and sold.,0
Has dairy in it. Not straight coconut milk/cream.,0
It was dried out when I opened package. Was very disappointed with this product.,0
Very disappointing. Bought these as gifts for my granddaughters. The light in the pens did not work from the start. Would not p,0
Terrible product had the dealer program it’s not consistent takes several times to lock and or unlock. Spend the extra $$ and buy OEM. Very frustrating,0
The seal of the product was broken when it arrived. This is ridiculous! I will not be purchasing another one from this seller.,0
Cheap pieces of crap! They did not stick well to the controller. Would not recommend. My 11 year old ended up taking them off because they were just that bad!,0
The product has a Prime badge but after 4 days Amazon said it is running late and I am eligible for a refund. The product did not show up in 5 days and I requested refund. I emailed the seller and he never responded.,0
"Bought this iPhone for my 9.7” 6th generation iPad as advertised. Not only did this take over 30 minutes just try to put it on, but it also doesn’t fit whatsoever. When we did get it on, it just bent right off the sides, exposing the entire edges of all the parts of the iPad. This is the worst piece of garbage I have bought from Amazon in years, save your money and go somewhere else!!",0
Audio hiss and the lightning plug broke within a week,0
Did not work at all. Right from box. Will not charge.,0
"Purchased in June but not worn till school started in August. Both shoes are falling apart at the toe. This is my 5th pair of Sketchers boots, at least 2nd pair of this style. I wear them daily and typically they let an entire school year. Very disappointing.",0
"These did not fit my 98 Chevy k1500. There was an overhang at the bottom and would not sit flush. It was a shame as they appeared to be of good quality. I returned them and was out the money for the shipping. Was advertised to fit my model and year, but that was not accurate so be careful. By the way I never write reviews, but I felt I had to on this one since I had to pay shipping on my return for a product that claimed to fit and did not.",0
"I have had a few laptops over the past few years in same price range. Actually most were cheaper. Rate features section says touch screen there is not one, which I knew by reading description so that is not at all the complaint. Computer works but I have never had one this SLOW. My last computer was same ram and space with the processor being an i3 vs. this one being amd. So guessing that is the difference, otherwise I got a lemon. Feel like I am back on dial up at times with high speed internet! After 2 months of use and no drops ect. this computer is already starting to act like it is going to quit. Worst computer I have ever bought in my life. Very disappointed,",0
"This charger started to fall apart after only 3 months. The back continually falls off and the cord wires are exposed. I would have expected a longer life on this charger. Poor quality. I'm sure I'll have to replace it. Description says 24 month warranty, however Warranty expired 3 months after purchase. I do not recommend.",0
Honestly this says 10oz my bottles I received wore a 4oz bottle,0
The first one I purchased broke after about a year so I went and order another one. The new one snapped in half while attached it to the hose. I barely tightened the thing at all and I'm not an olympic body builder or something. Very low quality.,0
Unit arrived with no charging cable or instructions!!!!!!!!!!! Cannot use it cannot charge!!!!!!,0
Couldn't take it anymore - had to throw out the hot smelly box before it stunk up the garage. Fellow Amazons - YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! THE BAGS SMELL LIKE CIG's!!!!!!!!,0
Bought it over a month ago and it never came in.,0
The hot glued parts are falling off.,0
It won’t stay clicked in to the seatbelt opening,0
This mop is pure rubbish! There are no directions in the box and I cannot get it to work. The mop head is quite small and I don’t expect the hard plastic components to last. I would return this if only I had opened the package immediately. Unfortunately my return window has closed so this will go out with the rest of my trash on Friday.,0
"Im not sure if its just this sellers stock of this product or what but the first order was no good, each bottle had mold and clumps in the bottle and usually companies will put a couple of metal beads in a bottle to aid in the mixing but these had a rock in it... like a rock off the ground. I decided to replace the item, same seller, and once again they were all clumpy and gross... I attached a photo. I wouldnt buy these, at least not from this seller.",0
Nothing is worse than getting a toy for a child and having it not work. This toy did not talk and left my 3 1/2 year old grandson upset. Waste of money.,0
I had these desk top fan since Christmas 2017 and only used them a hand full of times and now the fans don’t even work. What a waste of money.,0
"Package arrived damaged, possibly used?! No way I'll be using this for my newborn.",0
"The bible contains pictures, which depict Christ. The illustrations are well done, but give the bible a cartoon feel. My young reader wanted a more grown up bible. There are many, many sections of pictures which neither of us liked. Also, the pages are not bound well.",0
"I ordered this 5 months ago. Amazon said they sent an email to the manufacturer for me, then they sent me an email saying that the manufacturer no longer had email. Huh?! Amazon also said that could do nothing about it.",0
"This review is for Amazon directly rather than the product. The mailbox was damaged when arrived. The delivery box was fine, but the product packaging and the mailbox itself was damaged inside. Clearly someone at amazon fulfillment dropped the ball. Reordered. Return was easy.",0
"I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I’ve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It’s fantastic. I’v Had it for over a week with no problems. It’s faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.",0
"let me start off by saying this is not a bad rating for the product but rather Amazon for not delivering on time. So my order was over 8 days ago and Amazon barely shipped my package. All I received was an email indicating that the package would be late. The website continues to indicate that there were 15 miter saws still in stock. So when I get the shipping email, it moves the date by 5 additional days. No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service? I questioned myself, why do even shop on amazon? I suppose with the other options I won't any longer.",0
"At first I loved it because it looked good and was light weight. However, the magnet stuck to everything that my arm came in contact with and pulled my fit bit off, such as the refrigerator door, my office building door, the car door, etc. I have had my fitbit for over 3 years with the original band but after having the new bracelet a month, I lost it last week when it fell off somewhere between my office and th e restaurant I walked to for lunch. Very very disappointed! Now I am, out the money for the bracelet and I have to buy another fitbit.",0
I loved the first book so much had to read the sequel. Actually couldn't believe it was even better than the first,0
We did not get the package.,0
Right earbud has given our after less than 6 months of use. Do not buy.,0
"Adhesive stickers are completely defective. Mirrors fell off on their own with enough time, and shattered.",0
This product was defective and didn’t work. I contacted the seller who finally sent a return label and sent it back. This was three weeks ago and I still haven’t received a replacement nor a refund.,0
KIDS NEVER PLAYED WITH THEM AND THEY DO NOT KEEP A CHARGE!,0
"Very unfortunate that I have to 1 star this screen protector, but the adhesive is terrible. Very good value, but in 15 days I've had to use both that came with as they keep falling off. There are spots in the adhesive that are not coated and allow dust to get under the screen as well.",0
"ordered January 24th, officially opened the box last week (end of March) and it stopped working after second use. Apparently no returns after 30 days. Screwed consumer",0
Does not plug in well.,0
My cat didn't want to chew it. I wasted my money.,0
"Just used it 2 times on very small projects. Now less than 3 months, the paint will not spray out. Plus the handle gets hot while spraying. Properly cleaned it, still no paint will spray. Please refund my money. Very disappointed.",0
Falls of cup therefore does not hold tea bag string,0
Still haven’t received refund.. didn’t fit my 7/8 bar properly flew off on highway,0
It's only been a few weeks and it looks moldy & horrible. I bought from the manufacturer last year and had no problems.,0
"Personally, I couldn’t get past the scent of this. I don’t know wtf it’s supposed to be, but it smells just awful walking around and having it in my nostrils all day. No thanks!",0
Does not work. My phone says it is an unrecognized device.,0
Received wrong size.,0
"When i took it out of the box, i plugged it in and tried different heat values, but the tip never heated up. It appeared poorly constructed. Even if someone bought this and it worked. It would expect it wouldn't work for long.",0
Stopped working after a couple of weeks. You get what you pay for.,0
What a piece of shit ! Very disappointed,0
Not flashy at all. One little spot of blue. I feel really ripped off. Now i find out i CANNOT return it!!! I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!,0
"Not what I expected, not satisfied with the product",0
Navy color is 40% polyester. Stitching coming loose after a few washes.,0
cheap and waste of money,0
"The product fits fine and looks good. turn signal and heated mirror work. Unfortunately, the mirror vibrates on rough roads and rattles going over bumps. Plan to return it for a replacement.",0
I recieved a totally different product than I ordered (pictured) and I see that I cannot return it !?! I give them one star just because I'm tryin to be nice. I ordered these black hats for a christmas project that I am doin with my 5 yr old son for his classroom and now I'm afraid to even try to reorder them again in fear that I'll recieve another different product.,0
"When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out. THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.",0
"After use, became too loose.",0
Item was used/damaged when I received it. Seal on the box was broken so I checked everything before install and it looks like the power/data connections are burnt. Returning immediately.,0
The version I received does not have any illustrations at all. I was mistaken by looking at some of other reviews that had photos of the book showing pictures.,0
The smell of this stuff is terrible and extremely artificial.,0
The tv arrived with a shattered screen and Best Buy would not take it back. I opened the box after the return date and didn’t realize it was broken. Probably in transit. Best Buy should still take it back if it’s damaged.,0
"Absolute junk!I used it and broke withing 20 seconds,keep scrolling on this one,I give it zero stars.Poorly built,UNREAL that they actually built this thing to sell it,it should come free as an incentive to buy a 20 dollar drill.Better off using it as a handle to carry your drill,then again,it would prolly pop out of the drill from the 5 pounds of weight.",0
I don't like anything about it and I don't like that it is not able to be returned. JUNK!,0
Broke the first week. Do not buy!!!,0
Too big and awkward for your counter,0
Every bags was teared apart when I opened it. I can barely get a fine one to use.,0
"This is the worst mascara I have ever tried, and I've tried them all. I never got the length that was advertised and then when I went to put a second coat on, it basically turned all of my eyelashes into one big lash--all stuck together. I've seen some advertising in the past that was a little misleading, but this should be illegal to lie this bad.",0
As pictured and actual product is fine but they made me sign for it. I originally missed the delivery person and had to run down the road to get them or else I would have had to drive to the center for pick up. Why would you send make up you need to sign for without fair warning?,0
This product did not work as advertised in fact it was supposed to help keep my water clean but it did the opposite very disappointed,0
Crap! Totally not worth a penny.,0
The product suppose to come with the leash Leash is missing,0
Never receive my cases and never answer,0
Cheap knock off that came with rust on it. Sent it right back.,0
This is definitely a fake.,0
"It's a joke, won't work, doesn't help at all. Do not waste your money",0
"Your going to need all of them and you may get it even after watching the video on YouTube, I do not recommend this product.",0
"I am returning product, I’ve been getting the same Wella Brilliance shampoo for years...the darker and cheaper one circled, and the last Two deliveries were the lighter bottle which smells nothing like the product I want and have been using for nearly 10 years. Extremely dissatisfied, why would they have two products and two prices and send the one you DONT PICK????",0
Lots of static. Can barely hear my music,0
"I'm sure I would have liked it, but I never received it. I waited many months and finally went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought something else. Never could get any help to get my money back either. I rate this a zero.",0
"But I am so filled with disappointment. After investing time setting up the reminder schedule on my phone and syncing the watch, it would randomly reset itself, erasing all of the programming. Therefore my child didn't get any reminders the first day she had the watch. After re-doing it all over again, we woke up this morning to find it had reset AGAIN. Now it packed to be shipped back and I am scurrying to find another product that will actually work. As an FYI, the rubber band is very difficult to get on and off a child.",0
Okay if you like crass potty humor.,0
I’m not sure if I should keep this or not?? The seal was broken but the foil inside is still intact!,0
"I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired. UPDATE: I talked to a customer representative who refunded by money. Thank you AMAZON for your wonderful customer support!",0
Way to sensitive turns on and off 1000 times a night I guess it picks up bugs or something,0
"The one star is for UPS. I wish I had been home when delivery was made because I would have refused it. I have initiated return procedures, so hopefully when seller gets this mess back I will receive my $60 in a timely manner.",0
I thought I was buying a regular size tube of toothpaste. Why would I pay $2 for a travel size tube of toothpaste???? I felt like this was false advertising and a waste of money.,0
Uneven sticker. The yellow plastic is peeling off the blue portion of the HRC logo.,0
WARNING!!! Will make your fur babies sick! After 400 dollar vet bill the diagnosis is this.,0
I did not receive this item with my other items that were all in the same box,0
Really can't say because cat refused to try it. I gave it to someone else to try,0
When I received my package she was heavily damaged and poorly packaged probably the worst delivery for three items I purchased,0
"The quality of the fabric is not that good, although the price is pretty low.",0
"I ordered from this company because I've bought it previous seasons and it worked great for us. This season I bought the next size I needed. One of the pajamas I received had a hole on the foot of the pajama. I returned it and the company sent me a new one. The replacement pajama my son wore one time, I put it in my washing machine just like always and the zipper broke off! I'm so disappointed because I don't have time to be dealing with returns every few days and yet that is what is happening right now.",0
Grandchildren did not like them.,0
"Very difficult to get anything to come out of the ""spray"" bottle. It might work if you can figure out how to dispense the product. Maybe I will soak the sprayer portion in hot water and see what happens. Otherwise will need to work out how to get it out of the bottle to be used",0
The quality is terrible. The screen was glued on crooked which gave me a crooked picture. The glare/reflection on the screen is too much for my liking. Don't let the pictures advertising it fool you. It doesn't look anything like it's being advertised. I'm sending it back.,0
Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.,0
Not the real thing. I bought 2 of these hoping it would replace the original batteries well. Both worked for about 2 minutes and rhen neither worked again. Just pay the extra and get the real things.,0
"So pretty...but the first time I unplugged it, the glass top came off of the base. There’s a plastic ring attached to the bottom of the glass part. It has notches - supposedly to allow you to twist it onto the nightlight base. You’d need to be able to do that in order to replace the bulb. I’ll try gorilla glue or something to see if the ring can be securely affixed to the glass. Surprisingly poor design for something so beautiful.",0
Arrived broken! Bulb was fine but didn’t work...disappointing,0
"These are really more like tights than leggings, especially on the side panels which are completely see through.",0
Never received due to Amazons delivery service fault. Couldn’t get my address correct,0
"To me this product just does not work. Decided to give this a try based on the great reviews this product has. I used it for about two weeks and just did not feel any extra energy nor anything else. Obviously the seller has a good system, maybe even a little scam going on, give me a 5 star review and we will send you a free one. Not saying this will happen to everyone, but these were my results. Happy shopping!",0
"This product does not work, and unfortunately we missed the return window. Would not recommend.",0
"I am returning. Very flimsy, could not get top to stay on because the design, shelves did not stay in one place. Would not recommend this.",0
Never got mine in the mail now that I’m seeing this! Wow. I’d like a full refund !,0
"What can I say...I read the reviews. I knew the risks. My son really* wanted a red boombox. The thing stopped working after 2 weeks of playing. I pulled it out the other day because I needed a boombox and low and behold.....it still didn't work. Trust me, avoid this boombox!",0
Horrible all around. My girlfriend got one for herself and it works great. I got one for my mother’s room thinking it would help her sleep and it never worked,0
Finger print scanned does not work with it on,0
Took forever to do 1 nail.,0
Never received it! It days it shipped and delivered and I never got it. Contacted seller several times and they’ve done absolutely nothing about it. I want my money back SMH,0
ordered product in MARCH has not arrived as of MAY 11. Attempt to contact seller and NO response!,0
the packaging was so bad the box fell apart and crushed other smaller packages,0
No opening for middle seat buckle as advertised. Doesn’t stay in place even with tie down straps.,0
"Very disappointed! As soon as we ordered the paid version, it stopped working. We couldn’t sing any songs at all. The free version was better than the one we paid for! The whole app stopped working when we clicked “buy”.",0
I ordered chocolate gold coins & received a vaporizer cleansing kit....seriously. Trying to find contact info for the seller not having any luck.,0
"My son was so excited to receive this gift from Santa. He had been asking for it for 3 months. He opened it Christmas day and it was the first toy he played with. It stopped working after two hours. Cheaply made product with a big price tag. Based on the reviews here, the problem seems similar. This product should not be sold for more than $7.00.",0
This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!,0
"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",0
Did not fit my watch.,0
"I'm very disappointed to have been notified that my package arrived, and the product is not what I ordered at all. I ordered a hydration pack water backpack and instead received a first aid water proof bag. I order from Amazon all the time and this is the first time this has ever happened, but I was really looking forward to what I ordered.",0
I ordered two pairs of these shorts and was sent completely wrong sizes. I have both pairs same item ordered and the shorts are completely different sizes but are labeled the same size. One pair is 4 inches longer than the other.,0
"Unbelievable - The back of my iPhone XS cracked (with this case on) after just one drop less than 2 feet from the ground. I trusted you, so disappointed.",0
They were supposed to be “universal” but did not cover the whole seat of a Dodge Ram 97,0
"I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.",0
Hard to read and the colors are too bright.,0
Bought this just about 6 months agi and is already broken. Just does not charge the computer and is as good as stone. Would not recommend this and instead buy the original from he Mac store. This product is not worth the price.,0
"Camera fail to focus after couple of months. Wife loved that phone and love it more than new Nokia, but we can’t figure out how to fix it.",0
"Learned the hard way not to skimp and buy remanufactured ink carts. Got the carts and installed the black one, which was what I needed. Immediately my printer got super clogged and went from printing fine to printing 1” stripes across the paper. No amount of head cleaning and alignment would fix the problem. I ended up throwing the printer away and buying the newer model which was on sale. $50 for the new printer plus the cost of this horrible ink makes for an expensive lesson.",0
"Initially the product worked as explained. However, after a several months the edges begin to peel up(I also have a case one it), I tried to fix it with no luck. Maybe the peeling comprised the protective material in some way because after the peeling got worse my son dropped my phone, nothing crazy just a normal drop and the phone cracked all down the left edge and ran across the screen and I have otterbox case on it as well. Next time I would buy the glass protector and deal a slightly less responsive screen (as some say happens), seems worth it to me especially now I am stuff with a cracked screen and since that one incident it was knocked out of hand and now theres a huge crack right in the middle.",0
"So far I've only found sports from all over the country. I'll try it again, but that's not what I was looking for.",0
"Terrible product, wouldn't stick tok edges of the phone",0
Bought this Feb 2019. Its already wore down and in need of replacement. I dont recommend one purchase this unless its jus for looks.,0
"After 5 minutes of supervised play, the motor started making high pitched terrible screeching noises. Don't buy unless you have a tiny, useless little rat of a dog. Wasted $18.00",0
We bought this to use as a panel control for our home security system. It only works for couples of month then stop working.,0
"I use these shoes when I’m kayaking, once they have been wet a few times they smell badly.",0

It was the wrong color,0
This was 3 rd time I order reorder due to plants drying up and dying...I'm eligible for a return 2 of the 6 have died.,0
"The wig in the picture looks nothing like what I received. It's too big, no combs to support wearing it and the adjusting does not help with my size of head. I'm going to try to work with it, because I wear wigs regularly, however I do not plan to purchase this particular one again. I do not recommend this wig, if you are a new beginner with wearing wigs.",0
"After install, turned on and only half the bar worked. The company told me they would send another but at three months it’s still hasn’t showed up. Not holding my breath",0
Soft... Which is why I haven't thrown it away.. but it doesn't seem durable and the waist line is uncomfortable. I suggest wearing these around the house :) I haven't trusted to wear them outside.,0
I wish there were 2.0 version with a large canister. This only holds about 12oz coffee so it’s. It really enough to make a large one. It’s only good for one use at a time before it needs refreshing. I’ve tried to fill it 2 times in a row and the second pour was extremely watery because the inside had melted and poured out the air vents on the lid,0
Lasted a month and magnetic clasp wore out. It now comes apart and falls off. It’s too bad as I liked this one.,0
Item is comfy and gel material. So I gave it 2 stars for comfort. But as far as straightening my hammer toe...it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR IT. Possibly bc the material is too soft. There is no difference from having nothing on toe to when I put the little gel brace on.,0
I didnt wear it alot umm maybe for 2 weeks then after it looks kinda trashy,0
The bungee cord in the sticks for assembly broke after one use.,0
Sitting in an office all day I needed extra support. The strap on this doesn’t secure to the chair like you would need in order to use this how you’d expect to. I had to use a giant rubber band around the top half to keep it from tipping out/forward all the time.,0
I see a lot of people have these. They are a cute decoration but pretty cheap.,0
"Took one after eating oatmeal in the morning, drank 20 ounces of water, had a cup of coffee and then the taste kicked in.",0
"this bulb is not as bright as the other bulbs I ordered, looks funny when you see it on either side of my garage, one bright one not so bright. Going to return it and try another one.",0
"Unfortunately the trigger aspect broke the second time I used it, and it would not shut off. This was with a 1700 psi electric pressure washer. Returned",0
Too strong or peppery/minty for me.. I wanted to like this product. Like the idea - similar to oil pulling..,0
So I installed these in my rv and the color seems to very from light to light. Kind of dim and some were just not warm white as described but a blue tint or white color.,0
"I have bought two of these. The ring/kickstand in the back has broken off of both of them. The first one broke on the inside of the case, i thought maybe I was too rough with it. I ordered a second one and the ring broke off within days.",0
"I was excited to try this with my cricut since the first printable magnet paper I bought would bend/hang off the refrigerator extremely easy. Once this one arrived, I’ve noticed it was even thinner then my previous brand. I still wanted to give it a try and it seems to have a stronger hold then my other brand I’ve tried but the paper started peeling after it was cut. I won’t be buying Avery again because of this. I could of lived with the thinner magnet but because the design started to peel once it was cut then it’s worthless to me. Hope this helps.",0
This works as described..clear NO IT'S MILKY.. GOT A REFUND..,0
"It worked great for the first 4 days, but now the color either doesn’t come out at or comes out in clumps. Not sure if this is common or if I got a defective one.",0
Very thin. Not high quality but worked for the intended purpose.,0
I dislike this litter. I does not clump like it should and leaves litter box a mess.,0
Some of mine were dried out when I opened.Some of the colors were very light and didn't show up well.The darker colors worked the best. For the price it was a great range and selection of colors.,0
Returning these. They felt really cheap and I usually wear cheap sunglasses so that really says something lol. Felt super thin and flimsy the look was okay.,0
"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash.",0
It's ok. Material quality is great. Seems though that it's not a wide enough material used. My wife is small. 5 foot 3 and about 135 pounds. This barely goes around her. Seems they should add about 3-5 inches of material and it would be perfect. She needs an extra clip on bottom half to avoid any free shows.,0
Worked great but grip the device too hard. It stripped the charging plug on my s7edge 😢,0
The small was entirely too small I’m a 36DD waist 29 hips 40 the boobs did not fit at all so if you’re busty order a size up,0
"I have always own these type of shoes but for some reason these pair only lasted 3 weeks before the front rubber sole came separated. Updated review I order the Asics 6 on March 1 , and again I have to request a refund because on one sneaker the rear sole is coming Apart , I don't know what happen when you find awesome sneakers and good quality and once they get popular it's not the same quality anymore .",0
These worked for about 3 months until the right ear stopped working.,0
I wanted to love these. I expected them to smell like essential oils. They smelled more like old soap. And each one smells the same.,0
This never works it constantly is needing something to work.,0
"These ""tights"" are very thin, which I didn't expect given that they were also described as cropped pants. They are too small, although I ordered the large that was specified for my size (I wear a 6 or 8 in U.S. sizes). I can barely get them on, and I am afraid of ripping them. I will probably not wear them; not what I expected at all.",0
Two Stars because what I received wasn't what you see in the picture!! In the picture theres no nose cover which is what i wanted. Instead i received the kind that cover my nose. Second the velcro doesn't adjust it has only one setting and the velcro is misplaced the harder hooked part should face away from the head not towards it. Theres nothing like a Sleep mask thats two tight and catches your hair because you tried to adjust it.,0
"The book itself is beautiful but mine came in pretty bad shape. I bought it as a Christmas gift and it took almost two months to get to me, so there was no time to return it. Considering how long I waited and what I paid I was pretty disappointed in the quality. However, the book is very cool and I love Lisa's work.",0
"Instead of a black one I got a white one, but at least i could return it.",0
Flag itself was on point. Suction cup to secure the flag sucked.,0
The bracket that links the tub with the frame was badly designed and poorly manufactured. I tried to get a replacement bracket from the seller but they said no replacement parts were available. They offered a return label or a rebate. I chose the rebate since I had thrown away the shipping box and I thought I could get the bracket fixed. The bracket was made from weak metal so repairing it is not possible. Hopefully I can find a machinist to make me one.,0
"The device is nicely designed and quiet and seems to do a good job lowering allergen levels in our bedroom. However, it has one really silly design flaw - when plugged in it is always lit with an LED (red when off, blue when running). These lights are much dimmer than the night light they offer, but still much brighter than they should be for one's bedroom. I tape over the light, but it is impossible to block it out completely without also interfering with the air flow. Too bad!",0
Arrived with a dent in the lid. Packaging was great so I assume it was shipped that way. Shame because other than that it is another quality Stanley product. Not worth the hassle of returning for replacement.,0
This cord did not fit my Galaxy S6.,0
"The mandarin oranges were BLACK AND MOLDY inside, all 48 of the cups. They had to be thrown out. Buyer Beware!! Update. Amazon refunded me for these, consistent with their great customer service!",0
"I really wanted to like this stapler, I truly do. It's cute and lookd like a toy. Unfortunately it's sensor don't work well. It takes 3 to 5 tries for it to recognize that there's paper inserted and it should get to work. It's quite frustrating.",0
Nice quality but little empty inside and the adhesive is white which is looks bad on my car from side !Should make the adhesive black for the black emblem .,0
You have assemble it looks like a DIY project to me. Cheap materials.,0
"Plastic is way too hard,",0
This outfit was made in 5 minutes or less I believe. It was poor quality. Save your money,0
"Now it just sprays non-stop. It is easy to clean and was easy to assemble, but I didnt expect it to be disposable. Disappointed. Its suppose to have a warranty, but not sure I would even want another one. Luckily and unfortunately, it was cheap.",0
"I got a free sample of the charcoal one at Credo Beauty and I liked it, so much I bough this scent. I know you'll go through a detox phase when using a natural deodorant, but I've been using natural deodorant for several years and it made my odor worse and I had terrible wetness too. I had to stop using this one and use Lume Deodorant, which is 1000X better.",0
Rinse small. Not colorfast. Color runs even after a few washings.,0
"The emblem is exactly the right size for what I wanted. However despite being packaged as a genuine Mopar product, which I suspect is counterfeit or at l least hope so, because the adhesion is terrible... it fell off twice, fortunately both times in my driveway. So I took some 3M double sided tape and using an exacto knife put the 3M on the back of the emblem. That did the trick. However it should have come that way in the 1st place if it was really a genuine Mopar emblem.",0
Had to replace batteries constantly. By accident the base got wet and the dispenser did not work after even with the batteries replaced less than a year. I had to dispose of it.,0
"Nice charger, but keeps turning off and right back on again when charging phone. The annoying tones sound many times every charge cycle.",0
My daughter loves JoJo but this backpack is not stitched well. First day carrying to the school bus the top loop broke out.,0
Nice color but needs to be ironed to wear,0
WONT WORK WITH WINDOWS 10,0
It has great shut off but it’s very heavy and I guess my thumb isn’t strong enough. I also think the shut in and off is counterintuitive.,0
Cheap made but not cheap price. Wire in wing took no time to be poking out.,0
"It was a fine coffee maker for a while, but there were always issues with it. If you got water between the black plastic and metal on the carafe, it would leak and drain the water for days. Then our plastic lever broke which allows the coffee to flow through the filter and into the carafe. I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house. It's great at making coffee and keeping it hot, but there are too many other issues with it to invest in it at the current price.",0
"These were for the most part a waste of money, they do offer moderate protection but no enough to actually justify buying them. They were cut perfectly and fit well, I just don’t see any real value in them.",0
This was for our Grandson’s Birthday. The directions are extremely difficult to follow And there were parts missing My son-in-law is a mechanic and he was able to rig it up anyway I do not recommend this product,0
"The pods smell fantastic, but the coffee comes out super weak and barely has any flavor to it. :/ I’m glad I also bought the Breakfast Blend. Wouldn’t buy this again.",0
"There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made. The plastic will probably not last with much use either. The material and velcro were robust, but the quick release velcro was not intuitive to setup. I returned this.",0
The product came in a plastic bag and box but the labels were wet so I could not read them. I sprayed the product and there was very little change on the leads but it pretty much hurt all the plants.,0
Just received the honey. Looks great. However the lid arrived cracked and the seal was broken! Says no way to return or exchange. How can this be?! No pun intended. Sucks!,0
"It was an okay figure. The only couple of problems are the changeable hands can’t stay on his arm, and the sword is small",0
Velcro doesn't last long once it has contact with water and it's very uncomfortable and quite painful helps with my carpal tunnel while at work but on a daily basis id never wear it,0
"Used with our three dogs according to directions. No apparent benefit for two of our dogs, and the yeast may have actually compounded the problem of allergies with the third.",0
It was a little big/long the elastic straps on the sides of the mask. Would not stay tight to my face,0
"The pillows are soft but you could basically compress it down into a medium-sized purse. They present well but there's very little in them. I like soft pillows but I'd still like to lay on a pillow. They'll flatten out to feel like you're not laying on anything at all. If you need pillows just for show, these are great, but if you want to USE them, I suggest looking elsewhere.",0
came tangle waste of my money,0
The delivery was in front of my door but went to the wrong address didn't bring my package.,0
Ring broke off after a week.,0
"I have a big head. I admit it. I generally look for larger products for my noggin. I have a previous purchase of Gonex OTG goggles and wanted to ""shop"" and compare. The Gonex came with a great case, velvety bag, wipe cloths and were of a general higher build quality. I'm not returning the set, as my 6 year old and wife want to use them for snow this winter. Unfortunately, that wasn't the intent with the product. BE CAUTIOUS if you got a big melon!",0
"complicated, bulky not easy to use. will return it and search for another brand.",0
It went on very well but affected the sensitivity of my screen. It only lasted a few days before it pulled up and got caught on my case and the corner broke. Then it kept popping up and doesn't go back down well. Once off it doesn't go back on well.,0
The cord pulls off and leave the tips in my ears. They're hard to get out if you don't have tweezers or fingernails long enough to pull out. Not happy paying $19.00.,0
"The case works well and charges the phone quickly. However, it is bulky and a headphone adapter is needed to use the headphone jack. The case comes with the adapter but be prepared to carry it with you when you want to use headphones.",0
"Please read all the reviews regarding installation difficulty. To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned. I hope this review is helpful! Good luck!",0
"This item had an issue with the #1 key right out of the box. Unfortunately, I purchased it in August and I didn't get a chance to return it in time so I'm stuck with it now. I also purchased one of these in July of last year, and it completely died with no reason or warning. It wasn't dropped or abused in any way, just completely stopped working, even with new batteries. That's what led me to purchase this one, which adds a ""1"" to the numbers you're typing in if you hit any of the numbers close to the 1. It also seems to omit numbers that you feel like you've typed, so the keys on this one are very inconsistent and temperamental. Technically it works, but not great.",0
It only took my 2 year old 3 days to figure out how to work this lock. I did a lot of research before buying this lock because I read it was really tough to figure out (from a toddler's perspective). Either she is too smart or the lock is not as child proof as it should be.,0
The sunflower seeds look so good but they tasted old.,0
This was great for all of 3 months and then one day BOOM. Dead. No longer works. The product return window has passed as well as product support.,0
Just went to put on another one....bubbles everywhere and won’t come out. I’d continue shopping around before purchasing here,0
"We bought all these balls to practice and at least 5 of them developed a ""dead spot"" within a few uses to the point where you could not use them anymore. I had bought these because I thought they would last for at least a season. Not what i expected.",0
Too difficult to put together.,0
"If only the ring part were not metal, perhaps you could fold it out to alow wireless charging compatibility.",0
"The sharp bend of the crevice tool did not allow the lint to flow from the dryer into the vacuum cleaner. After using it for just a few seconds I noticed that the lint was not been extracted ... looking closely into the tool I found lint stuck inside and noticed that the passage narrowed greatly, thereby not allowing the lint to flow through. Tried blowing the lint out; tried straightening the tool so the stuck lint would flow out -- no luck.",0
"I am very unhappy with the helmet I received, it came out of the box warped (the shape of the helmet was bent like it had been squished.) The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy.",0
The second collar quit working the same day the return/exchange window closed. How convenient for the company.,0
Paid for two day shipping. Took over a week and a half.,0
"Broke in less than 2 months, and I’m only 110 lbs. Great product in the beginning, but the plastic is cheap and cracks if you put too much weight on it. It’s relatively easy to use compared to other boards. Stable center, low height, less wobbly in nature. I love the idea of it though. So much better than sitting all day and easier on the feet and back than just standing. Works your balance.",0
"It's super sticky, and I end up taking it with my phone when I grab it. Also, the Google pixel is too heavy for the pad to hold it upright. It is also a little long for my dashboard",0

I run a music studio and this was the main monitor sitting on the desk. The buzzing sound may be tolerable for normal use but any place that prioritizes silence should avoid at all costs. Dell customer support was not able to get me a replacement that didn't have the buzzing sound so I will be giving up and purchasing from another brand,0
"The tape is much like duct tape, but does not stick well, I am sure that I can find a use for it, but not as a secure fix. I realize that it is made to tape wires and cables to the floor, so obviously needs to be removed at some point. I didn't do enough research before purchase..Maybe it will make a good masking tape...",0
Was so excited to put it on my new car. Then I peeled the edge off and the outer ring separated from the middle. Didn't look right when I tried to put them together. Why design them separately like that?,0
"These lump up after about a week, causing them to be uncomfortable.",0
"The set up was pretty easy and the DVD guide made very confident when it came time to set up. However, once I began filling up the pool I noticed ground was wet. Their must be a very small leak somewhere at the bottom of the pool. Not sure if I should contract the company or not (previous reviews said they are of no help). Oh well, I guess that the risk I was taking buying an affordable pool.",0

"Purchased June 2018 and snapped while I was using it 15 months later. This is not something I use extremely frequently, so the cause was not overuse. I guess I got me $7 worth, but it’s not very fun having a resistance band snap when you’re using it...",0

I own so many of her books its ridiculous. Love her books. But this one was a disappointment. Teagan was an airhead for a better word. This is not something i am used to seeing in Feehan's books. I couldnt finish the book. I got to 70% and just could not take the stupidity of Teagan any longer.,0

"Grew up with these and was psyched to purchase them for my son, but they lost the package of live caterpillars. They told me they'd replace it and charge half the shipping this time. After significant phone time they ended up re-charging me for a new order with like a 3$ discount. I thought it was pretty unprofessional because not only did they lose it, but they led me to believe they'd rectify it only to charge me almost full price at the end of a 30 minute phone call with some spiel about a voucher. I spent 30 minutes on the phone so I caved and just bought another set of caterpillars. Whatever.",0

"I had high hopes for the lug nuts. I wanted the added security that these would provide. I have no issues with them performing as intended (holding my wheels in place). However, what I am unhappy with is the fact that I have had them on my truck for less than a week and they are already rusting. The paint that is applied to them is poor... I usually don't leave negative reviews, but I wanted to ensure that others know what will end up happening when they are purchased.",0

The battery dont last long I litteraly had it charging all day and when my son used it after 5-10 minutes it would heat up and not want to work other than that it works the app you have to use for the camera tho sadly does not work my son tried multiple times to uninstall and reinstalling the app but it does the same thing I plan on returning it since it overheats I'm afraid the battery will explode.,0
This product came on time. But it does not charge your phone like stated. It is a regular charging port not worth the purchase,0
Is good to protect your phone but It limits what your phone can do like the in display-fingerprint scanner does not work properly after installation and face Id takes longer to unlock your phone I even try to reset the fingerprints but did not work like it used to,0
"The product was well recommended by bush crafting videos on YouTube. But it arrived very dull.

Received the travel money belt and it a lot smaller than the pictures shows. I wished I did not buy it and will still have to look for something larger.,0
Not the correct bulbs would not work in conjunction with factory fog lights,0
"It dissolves very quickly. Ideally, it should last longer so it can work more effectively.",0
too loosen. cable is easy to dropping,0
None of my dogs will eat them. I am a groomer and none of my clients dogs like this flavor either. Everyone enjoys the plain liver version though.,0
"Recently installed new router. Every two to three days I need to reboot device. Checked netgear forums, appears to be a problem with new firmware version. Hopefully it is fixed soon.",0
"bought these to download data from a pixel 2 phone (using its usb-c to usb-a adapter). didn't work. it'll charge, but data doesn't flow. cables are braided and durable, and they seem to be a high-quality build, so for other purposes they might be quite reliable, but they're useless for me.",0
"The idea of this tracker is great and if it did what it should, I'd give it 5 stars easily. Bought the refurbished. It will sync but it doesn't remind for chores at all. I bought it mostly to remind him to use the restroom every hour or so. I thought maybe I could set an alarm every hour but you can only set one alarm... on a smart watch... how does that make any sense? Anyway, it'll sync and it'll chime when I check a chore off from the phone but the watch itself doesnt remind him of the chore which was the whole idea. I'll probably return it if I cant get that function to work. Good in theory, doesnt work in reality.",0
took to LOW In MN didn't make it home Great idea poor build.,0
Not durable. Our 5 year old son bit off almost all of the spikes on a ring within the first two days and he was only holding it from time to time.,0
Very flimsy wristband that doesn’t support very much. The magnetic isn’t strong at all so it doesn’t do much good.,0
"I wish I would have known to pay attention to the ""voltage"" or some sort of suction rating. While I love the attachments it's barely more useful than a broom. I end up sweeping after it for all the pieces this misses.",0
"Fit a little more snug than I expected after reading other reviews, but still happy with my purchase. Update: Right after my original review two small holes on the shoulder seam appeared. I wouldn’t buy this again.",0
Cheap. No where the quality it is represented to be. Granted Apple charges more for their version but what a piece of plastic junk this thing was. Thank goodness for Amazons return policy!,0
I received wrong color and wrong size.,0
"The first one I got was great. The last one I got was hard as pencil lead and broke just as easily. It went on only with much pressure. The wedge shape made the lines erratic at best. It must have been old, dried up product. It broke twice. There's very little product to begin with.",0
It’s an OK case the case scratch really easy but did save my phone when I dropped it on my motorcycle in the street,0
I've had this case for just 6 months and the case cracked and then broke.,0
"I purchased two and returned after my husband warned that it would look out of place in my living room, or an area not close to the kitchen. Also the most important thing to note is that there is a glaring solid red light that stays on. This would draw way too much attention to it even if I ignored my husband's suggestion. The camera worked well however the app could be a little more user friendly but it's not terrible. We're going to just invest in a real security system with motion detector nanny cams so they are more inconspicuous.",0
I have an older series 7 that I bought this to replace. But I might end up just keeping the older one. This one feels cheaper and more like plastic. Works about the same as older models,0
"Really cute, but the underwire dug into my ribcage.",0
There were no instructions!,0
"It’s uneven between the 2 sides, & the teeth aren’t cut all up. Edges of the teeth are sharp, but I filed it down w sandpaper & that helped.",0
Too large need to send back for smaller size,0
Big biggg large shoes as expected and loose fitting,0
Better off using pieces of yarn - difficult to transfer from one needle to the other.,0
"Wore it once. Washed and hung to dry. As I was folding it to put away, I noticed there’s a 1/2 inch hole in the sleeve. Disappointing.",0
"Nice pill container box, but unfortunately the pills won't stay in their compartment. Too much space at the top of the separate compartments.",0
Very cute but fit was super loose! Very flimsy quality!,0
The length was good. Quick delivery but the color looks more greenish then gray. I desperately need them so can't return. Will try to get another color.,0
"Package came crushed, box was torn in the bag.",0
Does no work with Moto z force 2,0
Sounds issues with these,0
"I don't know if maybe I got a dud but USBs will not go into the USB jacks all the way making it very easy to knock out and accidentally disconnect while you are using it. Very poorly designed, I do not recommend.",0
"While this product does work to keep the reflux in check, the side effects were pretty intense - bloating , gas for many hours after. I used it several times and got the same exact reaction. I think this may be due to the artificial sugar alcohols used to sweeten the tablets. Too bad they don't make a cleaner version of this. I've had better luck with lifestyle modifications in diet and making sure I eat sitting down, slowly and calmly (instead of standing up or eating while working.)",0
Cheaply made. Clip mechanism not strong. Does not stay bent into place. Blows a charge quickly. USB interface is flimsy.,0
Warranty contact info?...mine died after 6mo,0
These were useless. Probably one of the worst $20 purchases I’ve ever made in my life. They booted up one time and then I left the room and came back ready to use them and they would never turn on again. I hate them.,0
"These scents were not as good as I had hoped. You get a lot for you money, but only if you like the scents. There really is only 2 out the collection that I like.",0
"It’s perfect for my needs, but broke after 7 months of daily use.",0
"Just received but haven’t opened it yet, however very disappointed in the appearance of the package. It’s crumbled, looks beats up, opened and parts looked to have been moved around. Quite disappointed for this being ordered through amazon. Hopefully product is not damaged.",0
Love this drink. Does give me energy when needed and no crash. Will be ordering more.,0
These are comfortable but still sweaty they're not what I expected.,0
I loved the hat but I have a wider face. The bill didn’t quite look right- was too narrow for my face so I returned it.,0
Not enough support and the springs are glued inside and are coming loose!,0
"The features are nice, when they work, which is infrequently. The Bluetooth range is short, which is fine. we all know what we're getting into with the Bluetooth game. My issue is the device will fail silently and get 'stuck' on a temperature and gives the user absolutely no indication that anything has gone wrong. I have tried it 3x for smoking meat and it has failed in this way about 10 times. each time the only way i can figure it out is to notice that the temp stays the same for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, and then I must power cycle the device and force close and reopen the app. After i do this it starts working again. Unreliable garbage.",0
"Those are at least 30% smaller than standard ear backs of the same type. I suspect, too small for an average person to be able to hold them between your fingers comfortably.",0
Not a very close shave!,0
"Disappointed. I am used to another brand with adhesive to make it stick. These were covered in a slimy liquid that does stay on. It worked ok, that’s why it’s 2 stars, not 1.",0
"To be honest I should have looked closer regarding this product. This item boy comes in one size....tiny. Now I am a tall person so I am larger than most people. The only way these would stop any noise is if I shoved them way deep into my ear canal which I would not do. As it was, they were hard to remove. I will now search for a similar item than comes in different sizes.....I’ll keep these for my wife.",0
Very low quality materials and construction.,0
"These are incredibly thin, it practically rips when you have to open it and put something in it. All of them had a small tear on top and when we put a party favor in each, they would just rip more. If you need something sturdy, look for something else.",0
"Don't buy this, cheaply made, already broken after six months.",0
"I really wanted to like these. I got them specifically for driving as they have better allowance for peripheral vision. Problem is, like most low price point sunglasses they have a lens distortion. The distortion is subtle/minimal compared to other cheap models however it is most definitely still there and will wear on your eyes in the end. What a shame - otherwise the frame quality is quite good",0
Does not match dark skin,0
"I really wanted to like this, but i can’t get it to work with an OtterBox defender. When I place my phone on it, it charges for a few seconds but then it stops, waits a few seconds, tries again, and goes back off. The ledge it sits on is also a little small and doesn’t like to hold my phone on there. I haven’t had any luck horizontally either. The stand looks really nice on my nightstand though. The charger did work for me without a case, so I may buy a thinner case to be able to work with the charger.",0
"I was very excited and optimistic about this product! When first trying it, it was very comfortable but I wished it could be a little taller. I used it for a couple months at work and the seat started the slowly lower while sitting. I contacted the manufacturer directly and the customer was great. They sent me a replacement part and I was satisfied. Until about 2 months later and it is having the same problem. Contacted them again, they sent another replacement part but this one for some reason or another won’t raise as high as the others had. When contacted again, the customer service rep let me know that it could take a month to get a new part shipped from overseas. I like this product but am disappointed with the quality.",0
"The hot water bottle stays warm for a good amount of time, but it STINKS! I kept it outside for over a week to try and get rid of the smell and it’s just as bad as day 1. If I let my clothes touch it, they smell too. I will be looking for another product to replace this one. Irritated I didn’t return it in the right amount of time.",0
"The product looks nice and will do what it's intended for, but it arrived with scratches in the acrylic which make me question how long before it looks like trash. Shelf inserts were a nice touch though.",0
"the pen was heavy, it was just a simple rollerball cartridge in pretty casing which was alright, I suppose. What I wasn't happy about was that the pen came chipped and the chipped piece wasn't in the packaging so that I could glue it back on. It was wrapped better than most things I've ordered online so there's no way this was done through shipping and the thing was not delicate. maybe just not checked thoroughly before being wrapped up?",0
Still hurts my feet.,0
I’ll pay extra money to come in early and they come in a month,0
It’s cute but very poor quality. Gets rusted quick.,0
"My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.",0
Good quality but too small,0
This fit well so I can't complain about that. The white is just so see through. Will probably never wear it!,0
Love love the case but it cracked at the top and bottom while putting it on the device. Sad,0
This item was way too oversized. The floral print on sleeves is a different material than the black middle of the top. The flowers also look super fake.,0
Shirt was cute but quality of material was not great,0
"I was so disappointed in these shoes. They took so long to be delivered, without and shipping updates whatsoever. When I finally got them I discovered a cheaply made shoe. The platform is either styrofoam or a stacked cardboard like material, and the straps are a very thin and cheap looking felt. The buckle on the ankles do not even properly clasp. I’m giving this product two stars because in pictures and from a distance they do serve the look I am trying to achieve.",0
"I thought the lotion would feel, a little more creamy. Feels very watery for lotion. Not satisfied, cant even tell of it moisturizes my body.",0
My son loves Optimus Prime. He only has this for a couple of hours before he broke off several pieces trying to transform it.,0
Half the papers had weird creases in the middle. Could only use about 300 pages out of 500.,0
The battery that comes with the flashlight is no good dies really fast and the magnet is really weak,0
LIttle uncomfortable and didn’t notice a difference and they had fallen out while I was sleeping,0
"I liked this holder. It looked really nice on my keyring, however....it broke after three months. The ring snagged on something in my pocket and when I pulled on it, the piece of material that holds it onto the medallion snapped off. So, I am trying a different holder that is one piece of leather.",0
"Lasted 14 Months then died. Used a couple of times a week over 14 month period, so maybe that's all that can be expected of it.",0
just didn't care for it,0
"Bought it for its features. While it worked, it was fine. Problems: was too inconsistent in detecting shots and tee boxes. So requires intervention almost every hole to ensure accuracy. Impossible to play well if one was to focus on the app. And after 11 months, almost 60% of the sensors are no longer working. Save your money and hassle.",0
"This book is like a footnote guide to things you already know.... It rings of truth but barely glances over every subject with 6-8 page chapters in a larger print. I guess it is great for bathroom reading... Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the depth of the subject matter left something lacking.",0
Pockets and strap too tight. Difficult to get things in and out of while wearing.,0
"The attachment cleaning tool doesn't fit on my Shark Navigator. The item seems to be made of sturdy plastic, but I'm unable to use it. This item needs more fittings to accommodate various vacuums. This isn't as ""Universal"" as we're led to believe. I'm disappointed. Returning for refund.",0
Balls were smaller than I thought they were going to be.,0
"Too Warm - Expected it to be made out of a material like a bath towel. Very soft, but seems like an old lady would wear this to stay warm inside a building that the A/C is on in the summertime on a 95 degree day...",0
"Gosh! They sent me a different item. I saw the picture and it showed it’s medium roast coffee, so I bought two of them. But I got the light roast coffee. Can’t just trust the picture information.",0
Directions for set up are not in english not well put together.,0
These are a good value for your money they look nice but they are way too heavy I saw some review that said lightweight which made me purchase ....they are definitely not lightweight,0
Pump settings do not work. Lowest two settings pump no water although you can hear and feel the pump working. 3rd setting pumps too much water so spills on the floor - I have varied the water depth but it made no difference. Looks great but going back as it does not work as expected.,0
wish I've read the reviews first. What a disappointment.,0
"Very large and the moter is loud, it’s not realistic at all. Disappointed",0
This did not work very well on my 2 cairn terriers.,0
It just doesnt look like picture. The picture looks tightly gathered and beautifully ruffled. I've had it awhile now and I'm going to take it off bed and try to do some sewing to it and see if I can fix it. I probably should have returned it right away but it's too late now and I think with some adjustments I can make it work.,0
"Performs as expected for cooking purposes. However, handle melted when resting on rim of frying pan for a very short time. This an unacceptable and is a possible safety issue. Would not buy again.",0
"The wicker is wrapped much more loosely than pictured. Basically an outline of the ball, not the multiple layers as shown. Will not buy again.",0
"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",0
Does not fit well on all large breed dogs. Cheaply made and broke very easily. The product didn’t hold up longer than 2 months for both a small boxer and a extra large king shepherd dog.,0
"We use Wooster all the time in 9"" and 11"" rollers and love the coverage. Tried this one but the holder was not good.",0
"Very flimsy, thin felt on top, thin rubber bottom.",0
I like the product it’s a nice size and color! Unfortunately only had it a week and opened the one door and it cracked the top of the wood piece! I’m really disappointed! It’s all assembled and I don’t have the box anymore so how could I even think about sending it back?! My husband did try and fix it with wood glue but sadly that didn’t work either! The door popped right out again!!,0
"A lot of the welds were very sketchy, which made assembly more difficult. I say more difficult because the instructions are unintelligible with pictures that serve almost no function. I still managed to put it together and it holds my guitars, but wobbles too much for my comfort when placing or removing a guitar. Not sure how long it'll last.",0
Not delicious without altering. Very acidic straight or diluted. I would prefer something smoother and darker.,0
"1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.",0
Even with a pre-shave conditioner it burned the crap out of my throat.,0
I gifted this phone to my cousin and she indicated to me that it is very hot. She has to use the speaker when making calls. A technician told her it may be the motherboard.,0
still waiting for the first issue,0
I returned. They were slightly too large and the color was off.,0
I ordered the xl and it is way to small.,0
The kit comes with the wrong tool to swap the lens. The T4 tool is too big to take off the screws to replace the lenses. Be careful not to strip the screws while attempting to swap lenses. Luckily my lenses were already a little loose so I was able to replace them. Other than that the lenses seem to be of decent quality. They seem just as dark as the original lenses.,0
No support. Just seemed to keep the ladies pushed down and against me. Returning.,0
"This is the 2nd time I have ordered these bottles. My first one came packaged in a sealed box, no damage whatsoever. This order came and although the outside Amazon box was in perfect condition, the box of rollerballs inside was smashed, torn up, and not sealed. The caps are all scratched up. I was making up some rollerballs for gifts for my family, and hate the thought of gifting these! Hoping this is a fluke, and they’ll make it right quickly!",0
Broke within a week and was told I could not use the extended warranty I bought until after the manufacturer warranty is expired. What a rip off.,0
"I returned this bottle unused. Didn't like the baby pink color and the pink and blue print of the insulation sleeve. The description said rose quartz, but it is just baby pink. The product looked like cheap plastic and did not appeal to me visually.",0
"Product did not last long at all, been using 4 to 5 days a week at the gym, they no longer work. Starting using in August, shopping for a new pair ,today.",0
"Great concept, but the wires are still a mess and this did not do much to help the problem",0
My hair is bleached and this definitely didn’t get the knots out after a shower.,0
Did not crimp the tube tubes,0
"It looks great, but after using it, it just doesn't do the job. I guess it's good for the price, but I definitely wish I would have spent a little more money and got a product that actually works.",0
Images shows a double case pink one and green one. I only received the green. Not at all what i ecpected,0
I like the quality but extremely too small. Looks like a 2x.,0
Fits kind on tight in the chest area and I'm a 38B and purchase large,0
"It moves too easily when you slide an envelope through it. It needs to have a non-skid bottom incorporated to its design. I only have one functioning arm, so I can't hold the opener to keep it from moving. This design flaw defeats the purpose of this purchase in my unique circumstances.",0
"These are wonderful poles tall durable the cap is nice on the top, reflective tape is good. The only downside that is disappointing is I bought the yellow ones and within a month they are compleatly faded. I was using them in the summer to mark areas on a field. Now they are almost white which makes them very hard to see, kind of defeats the purpose of buying nice visible poles.",0
Quality wise very cheap not durable.,0
"I really like these glasses while they last, but an arm has broken on at least three of them and I'm not buying them again.",0
"I received these for Father's day 2018. At first I really loved them, but the battery doesn't last long, therefore I could only use one at a time while the other stayed in the charger. After five months they stopped working. I could charge them all day and night and they would not come on. What a waste of money. I'm very disappointed and highly recommend you look into a different product. Unfortunately the time to return these have come and gone and now I'm stuck with a useless paperweight",0
"This lamp looks and feels very cheap however for $10 it does the job. Item did not come with remote (box has picture of lamp with remote) and the motion sensor does not work. I chose this item because it said Amazons Choice, however it was not what I was expecting!",0
"It's big, but the colors are awful. Throwing away not worth it to return",0
Great style and pattern but Material is cheap and looks it.,0
Very cheap material. Didnt seem to be safely connected to seat well enough,0
The protective case seemed good quality. The tempered glass showed up in a separate package and the box was empty.,0
Didn’t really see results with this...still have a lot left because I found other products that worked much better..I will say it lasts long...,0
"First of all it doesn't dissolve in water. 2nd of all, it doesn't seem to make a difference in workout with or without.",0
I bought these for birthday goodie bags. My girls are obsessed with squishes. These however are not actual squishies and I was not aware of that. Really disappointing.,0
"Very thin material, the small fit very large, especially in chest. Not sure who this would fit it's just a strange design and material. For reference I am 5'8, 130lbs, 32DD. Provided no support as well and very flimsy",0
I have used the full contents and have not seen any true changes in my feet. I am diabetic and do have diabetic problems that this product was not effective on.,0
Not what I expected.,0
The download for this software is available for free elsewhere,0
"I got that as a Christmas present for a 4 year old. For adults it's ok to put together but for a 4 year old not, it is to difficult to clip them together. The led lights would work only for a couple of days and then only partially. Out of 5 cars only 2 work ok, the others are very slow even with new batteries. It hurts to watch them struggling around the tracks and praying they make the round while the 2 strong cars crash into the slow once and push them around. All in all good idea but didn't go through quality control for sure. Big disappointment!",0
I ordered about 8 items and got only five of them delivered. The other three package was nowhere to be found even though it is shown that it was delivered. I tried to find the items everywhere but there was nothing.,0
This arrived on time. The thread came apart pretty quickly. The colors were very nice. My son loved this toy. He was quite disappointed that the threading came undone.,0
Not very good they sheets easily rip as you try to bloat and wipe the extra oil on your face. Going back to Clean & Clear oil absorbing sheet are the best kind. Sad I wasted my money on trying these they totally disappointed me.,0
"Would not recommend. The bits are poorly made. It isn't a big deal on the philips and other bits that don't need percision, but the holes and lobes of some of the security bits are off enough where I don't think I could use them.",0
This slime is not fluffy it was very sticky. The picture shows the slime swirled together and you cannot do that with this slime.,0
"This did not help my hair and scalp. Had a pretty bad allergic reaction,I am not saying it is bad product. Just didn't work for me.",0
Smells a little oily...,0
I miss their old design. Too hard to get my little one into this. Notice that the shoulder strap attaches to the door. I need to have the bag on my shoulder to get my dog in properly. So disappointed. Found older version on EBay and bought 3 of them!,0
"These mats are functional, but they are NOT the same color as seen in the pics. Not even close. The mats I received were a very light grey, and not the dark grey depicted on this page. I sent them back. .",0
"I have two cats. One has a very healthy appetite and carries a good weight. The other is finicky and though she eats a lot of what she likes, she stays quite thin. I had hoped to add a bit of weight on her, but she wouldn't touch this supplement (she does wolf down her Organic Hairball Remedy which comes in similar form). My other guy sniffed, but after one tentative tiny lick, walked away (and he eats almost anything). Doesn't smell particularly appetizing (i.e., doesn't smell like food) to me either. Waste of money for this household.",0
"Great product for a while, the hard plastic is a perfect fit! The problem is the rubber will start to fail in a year or two and the case will no longer be good. Shop around before you buy:)",0
"Completely thought this was a wall decal that’s sticks right away. You have to remove the butterflies from the card and still put the adhesive sticker on it. Some stickers are a bit big for the butterfly. It still looks nice, but requires a bit more effort than other wall decals",0
"It was a nice cover at first, and does seem like it will offer necessary protection in case of a drop, but after about a week it started discoloring. I ended up returning it.",0
Bought a few for craft show tables. I’ve owned them for years & I just can’t get the wrinkles out.,0
Not to well when u have to erase it,0
"It looks like these are Xerox copies of what they should be. The resolution on the lines is choppy. Also many of the designs only cover a fraction of the page, less than half. My daughter will still get some use out of it and it wasn't too expensive, but it isn't anywhere near as nice as other adult coloring books she has had.",0
Purchased 2 of these for me and my son. It is way too tight to fit credit cards into the slots that they are supposed to fit in.,0
Applied per directions and it still does not lay properly. I going to find the one I had before.,0
This product is very hard to use.,0
"I love these sponges for removing threads from project. But I ordered a 12- pack and first order only included one sponge. Second time, this was supposed to be corrected and only received one sponge in that order also.",0
"Bottoms are great, but absolutely no top support",0
"First of all, this had no directions or even a product photo in the package. I had to open my order on Amazon to literally figure out which sides attach. The other problem? Unless you look live in a Hobbit house or are really tall, don’t bother. I’m 5’4 and I can’t even reach the hooks without going on my toes or getting a ladder. The wood was really splintery and the front pieces of metal were pretty rough looking.",0
"Love the quilted material. The rod inserts are a good idea, the slipcover arms and rods pull out even with the slightest recline. The advertisement says "" straps"", but there is only one strap for the chair back in the package. Will fold the arms underneath the seat portion to try and get some use from the product. Very disappointed.",0
"I sent this back. It had my body fat extremely low, and while I’d love to believe that what it says is true, I know it’s not accurate. And what’s the point of having a scale of it isn’t accurate??",0
Tiny for the price. I thought it was going to be a product for my whole body. But I’d use the whole bottle with one application.,0
"I tried for a month to break this in... but it just isn't the same ball as the ones that others bring to your gym. It doesn't have the same grip or general feel, and looses air very quickly. Better than your average ball still, but not what I paid for and not worth $50+",0
I really wanted to like this but first when the package came the soap was so strong you can smell it from the sealed package but after you shave the smell that it leaves behind is amazing. Still trying to create a lather was ridiculously hard.,0
"The Puzzle dictionary is too heavy to handle. The words, Clues, I tried to look up were more difficult than the clue itself. Would not suggest it for making Crossword Puzzles easier.",0
They break/Rip very easy,0
"Slow read, having a hard time getting through this book.",0
"I can't tell yet still using them, I think they would digest better in capsule form instead of a rock hard pill.",0
I did not get my product yet. It was listed as a prime item with the standard 2 day lead time. It is scheduled to come tomorrow. That means it took a week to get. Not sure of the issue but that is the story. Hopefully it get's here tomorrow Thanks,0
They are very uncomfortable. I can't sleep on them!!,0
"If you're old school expecting that same rich fragrance you knew, you'll be sorely disappointed. Nondescript scent, must hold close to nose to detect. Don't know about feel on the skin as it was a gift. Very well packaged, though.",0
Just didn't like the setup and action of this bingo game,0
"This is a nice looking band with some serious problems. First, the clasp is nearly impossible to open, especially one-handed. Second, if you make it small enough to fit your wrist (in order to get the HR monitor to register), then it is even more difficult to get back on if you are able to get it open and off.",0
"Never actually got to try the product. It came in the packaging, with some sort of tape over the bottle and loose powder all inside the package. There was also no inner protective seal. Quite frankly it looks like it was a used product that was shipped to me. Returning for a refund.",0
you cant see your shot very good at all!!,0
"This was my first menstrual cup and unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Even after getting the hang of putting it in and taking it out, the silicone is just way to firm for me. I bought the small size but maybe the diameter was still to wide? It was too painful to wear.",0
I would have liked them to be smaller!,0
Falls out of the socket a lot. Not very sturdy either,0
"Well, I’ve ordered a ton of plants from Amazon, and this one came in the worst shape. They should have sent me a different one. The picture shows a full plant, but I some how received a sad looking one. It will take quite some time for this to look truly presentable. I hope it lives. I may need to isolate it just in case it has pests. 😬",0
Waste of money. My girl was opening with a hope that there will be a toy and just one toy in all box all others were stickers and some stupid things,0
"Well made, but needs to have a larger handle to hold really small.",0
"Package came with four cartridges, the liquid inside one of them was completely yellow/brown",0
"Front landing leg extensions fell off in the first flight. They are held on by friction only and I guess the vibration was all it took to drop them off although I had no excessive vibration warning. I pushed them onto the existing Mavic legs as far as they would go and they seemed secure but when the drone returned after a 20 minute flight, they were gone. The back legs snap on and were still there. The gimbal guard , stick protector and lens hood are fine but the leg extensions were my reason for the purchase. I gave an extra star for the other parts that seem ok.",0
I have had these on for 3 days and already have condensation. I think the seals are defective but waiting for the seller to contact me.,0
we live with a road on either side of us and it really didn't help our dust problem,0
The main LED light doesn't work. The two red lights do work.,0
"This is a very cheap made product. Going to check the return policy, hopefully can return free. Would not recommend.",0
"This plastic filter wrench is too soft, it could not hold the extension, the extension kept spinning around in the head of the wrench, I had to use a one inch socket on the outer end to remove the oil filter, but even this part was too soft. It won't last long, maybe one or two more use and it will Ibe worn out. It should have been made of metal.",0
They were beautiful but way to fragile. One cracked while putting gumballs inside and the second while washing at the end of the party. I am left with only one. Very disappointed.,0
Took forever to arrive. Once it did... was in packaging from the Wish app. And mangled at that.,0
this is a cheap knockoff with no screen cover. not worth the money,0
"The saying was beautiful , the plaque is warped It cannot be placed on the base we have for our dog. Would like it replaced",0
It was a mistake. I meant to order Quicken for Dummies. My mistake.,0
"Was way more orange looking then the pictures, it is a very bright light orange color.",0
"Though these technically serve their purpose, and are easy enough to handle, I personally wish these were not as transparent. Because they are so transparent, they actually are much lighter {individually} than the picture. You can see the covered Bingo card numbers right through these chips. I will look for some opaque (not transparent) colored chips.",0
On the second attempt to reuse the stencil before it pulled apart. Very disappointed Martha. Expected better quality from you.,0
Stopped cooking the eggs properly after,0
"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",0
"Leaves skin feeling okay, but didn't remove any blackheads, and I used it as directed. Washed face, used some hot towels and vapor to open pores, no blackheads were removed.",0
"Only one tray came and it seemed NOT sturdy or well made, like a cheap knockoff.",0
"Good price, keyway doesn’t fit for my ‘16 Veloster like they tried to say it would. They also claimed you could program the key online? But I had to have a locksmith program it and he needed a PIN from my Hyundai dealer in town",0
"I bought the breathable version and it doesn't really do a good job of shaping. After wearing it twice, one of the steel bones started poking out.",0
"I tried to use this on my lash extensions and it clumped pretty badly. For the money, I wouldn’t purchase again.",0
The sizing was way off. Bought size XL for my daughter who wears a medium bottom and large top. The size was so small,0
"It's an ok sand, it's really rough, it is definitely not like the geographic channel sand or moon sand. It's just sand.",0
This product is definitely lightweight but it’s so cheap feeling due too how thin it is. I have purchased many swaddles and was so excited to finally try this brand because how popular they are and since they have really cute prints BUT the seems look like after two more washes they will come undone and it’s so thin and large I don’t know what real use I’ll get out of it. Not practical for the baby to lay and play on it due to how this and not practical for a good swaddle in my opinion especially if your a first time mom and new to swaddling,0
"Jason hand and body great smell great softness great moisturizing. But how it cam in the package where it must have been very hot they were very warm tubes, hope they don't loose any of their potency???????????",0
Haven't tried yet. Was wondering if I should still take my thyroid medicine with this as well. Really hoping to try it and see if it works.,0
"I purchased this grill cover 2 years ago and, initially it seemed like a nice cover. It fit well and felt like it was made with decent quality materials Now the material is faded, flaking and easily tearing. I’m about to toss it and am shopping for a new one; by a different manufacturer.",0
I have put these together many times and never had any trouble. The last two I ordered have lost 3 of 4 pedals have come off. :(,0
"I bought this as a Christmas gift and it was just recently set up and one of the brackets for the cover cracked. Since it was bought months ago, it’s no longer covered. Also, the sound is not good. It’s much better if you connect it to other speakers.",0
"This SD card does not work as advertised. I can use it, kind of, but all operations are slow, and some functions don't work. My phone can't use it as internal storage like it's supposed to. Videos I transfer from my computer won't work (but they do when I transfer to internal storage). Netflix won't download videos to the SD card. It'll try, but the videos either won't load, or can't be recognized by Netflix, and the app will automatically change the storage location. This card came to me at least partially corrupted, and it just won't work properly.",0
"Does not fit my 2002 Seadoo GTX DI, it is about 6 inches too short to cover the length of the ski. It is good quality so I’m very disapointed it does not fit like it says it should.",0
"My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn’t budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I’m not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life. I’ll update my review in a month or so, once I’ve had time to evaluate if they’re truly beneficial for my plants.",0
Looks too much like christmas lights,0
"Bought the black one with flowers on the sleeves and hood. This is my second time wearing it, and a big hole is forming on my l the left arm from the thread loosening. Returning for poor quality.",0
Worked for about 2 months then stuck wide open destroying my pump,0
The design is cute but the sleeper bra fits weird. It's tighter under the boobs and loose in the cup area so that when i lay to the side my boob doesn't stay in the bra. Can't wear them to actually sleep in otherwise I'll run the risk of leaking all over my bed.,0
I was so disappointed when I got these. They are very poorly made and difficult to pose. I kept them because I have an acre to decorate.,0
My dog scratched right through it on the first use.,0
"Looked great at first, but faded out of my hair by third week. Don’t recommend if looking for longer lasting color.",0
These are powerful but very brittle. Half of them broke/cracked apart immediately.,0
$2.50 for 1 Qt of milk? Too Expensive for powdered milk!,0
I’m afraid this body shaper was not for me. Gave me a really weird shape . Not at all comfortable. Will be sending it back.,0
"I cannot rate the efficiency of the unit because I've not been able to use - only directions enclosed are written in Chinese, not a language I am versed in. Additionally, received an entirely different brand of unit, similar in look but not what I actually ordered. Contacted vendor who had offered to send an instructional video (did not) and did not address the brand switch. Without further email exchange I was given a $10 credit toward the unit cost of ~$30 - appreciated but not what I asked for so now I've spent only $20 on an item that is going unused (until I can locate some online user instructions. Oh well...",0
The quality of the answering machine is very poor. The messages are similar to a cell phone having poor reception. Same problem with incoming calls using the handset. The handsets are attractive but I'm returning it after one week. Very disappointing.,0
"The box was totally mangled. You could see where it had been taped then the tape ripped off. It almost looked like it had been returned then shipped out again. When I opened the box, the coffee had just been thrown in. The flavor is ok, not a very strong flavor. I will stick to my Green Mountain coffee.",0
I have given 2+ rating as it works with Panasonic TV however the buttons are very hard and doesn't look like Original Panasonic.,0
Caution! If you have a case on your iPhone or iPad you may not be able to use this. It won’t plug in far enough.,0
"If not wipe immediately, it streaks, did not like.",0
"this isn't as bad but still , i will never purchase grayscale coloring books again , i bought both of these for my sister-in law",0
Did not work as claimed. Made a much bigger problem.,0
"These were a gift. The sound and noise cancellation are very good. However, watching a movie on an airplane becomes a painful experience due to the pressure of the too-small round ear covers. It is now too late to return them, or I would have done so.",0
The shoes was too small. I reordered this item. Instead of the 4.5 I needed an eight. I also purchased an 8.5 and it was too big. I’m reordering an 8 regular. Thanks I’ll give it a rating as soon as I receive the right size thanks Need everything needed for returns!,0
"Fell apart right away as soon as I removed from the box, large end won't stay on ...",0
2 broke not sure if it was my bad handling our just bad tools.,0
"Love the lights, but they don’t fit like factory at all and the wiring is different. I hit my blinkers and my reverse lights come on. I have a 93 Toyota 4x4 pickup. Just wish it would have been the real deal, looks like they are more universal",0
I can truly eat just about anything but these....these are gross!,0
"The story was all over the place. I felt no connection to Evelyn/Eva/Evie, and the ending was anticlimactic. Thank goodness it was a free book.",0
Has a chaulky taste.,0
Did not get all the screws to put this together. Plus the instructions were not very clear. They only showed pictures and no real instructions to follow. Will be calling their customer care ASAP to figure out how to get the missing screws.,0
The DVD movie was no good it was damaged could not watch it useless order waist of money,0
Length fit width was to small,0
"There are two kinds of double armor cases. You have the cheap ones that come with a flimsy plastic inside shell, and very soft rubbery skin on the outside. You feel like if you drop your tablet, the whole case will come apart. Than you have the flexible inside plastic shell with padding, and thick hard rubber skin on the outside. You feel like you can drop your tablet from the roof and it would be protected. This case is best described by the first description.",0
"Loved this purse but, I can't take the bad odor coming from inside the purse. I even aired it out for two days and there was no difference. In process of returning.",0
"After a week of using this product , it no longer gave any audio to speakers",0
The treats were great but bag had a lot of powder/broken down treats. Made purchase not worth it.,0
it's been only one day and already my dog has destroyed two of the toys . My dog only weighs 30 lbs and is of medium build. Rope toys are completely useless against a dog's teeth therefore I will not be ordering anymore bark boxes,0
"The vases I purchased were not what I expected. Quite a few were covered in wax, I recieved 16 not 18 and there was no cleaning cloth included.",0
USB Light is not working,0
Way lighter than I thought. Figured it would be like the sand type ones that flatten against the door. Its just a stuffed pillow,0
"I was disappointed upon receiving this item as the silver part that goes around the face appeared to be made of some sort of cheap plastic. It's not the fact that it was made of plastic that disappointed me as much as the fact that the plastic used made it look incredibly cheap. For me, this detail ruined the whole look for me. I also did not trust it to hold up to everyday wear so I ended up returning it. I was disappointed because it seemed like it would have been a good deal if it had not been for that. However, it you can overlook that, then it might be right for you. It was packaged well and did arrive quickly.",0
"My daughter is very small for her age, she’s 2 and on the 5th percentile. These were small on her and I was honestly looking for underwear that would run small but there have a bikini cut or something so her butt cheeks are out on the sides, she’s a toddler so I dont need that, we needed comfort and coverage since she’s still new to going potty consistently. I gave it two stars, delivery was timely and fine but the product was definitely disappointing.",0
"First, the button for the crown only works to scroll. The watch didn't charge while it was the case. It actually lost power. The Philips head screwdriver could barely turn the the screw that holds the case tightly together because one of the legs of the ""+"" is missing. I have my own set of small screwdrivers so I was able to loosen and tighten the screw. To me the case took too much away from the watch functions for me.",0
Great sound but the cable that connects to the earphones come undone way to easy. If you’re moving around on stage a lot I wouldn’t recommend it.,0
Just ok. increased width of grip too much. took it off,0
Wish I would have spent money for better quality. You get what you pay for though. They are very fragile (break easily) and don't want to stay up. We had to use yard staples to secure it. And if it's windy at all....forget about it!,0
"Doesn't last long, even at a low setting",0
"unfortunately my computer does not recognize the battery, but they sent me a prepaid label to return the battery and return my money.",0
"I was very excited to receive this mask for event, only to receive it un wrapped in a cardboard box with scuffs and scratches all over the face mask",0
One leaked out in bag during shipping,0
I bought this specifically as the product description says it has a board short connector. It does NOT. Very disappointing. Now have to deal with returning it.,0
The smell was repellant with a chemical smell. It only smelled faintly like ylang ylang.,0
it was just ok. I work in a warehouse and I have a walkie-talkie attached to my shoulder so its nice to have music to listen to in my other ear but its not loud enough. I didn't really have high expectations for the sound quality but it wasn't even loud enough to hear the lyrics. Mine must have been defective because I've it in 3 occasions and it would die after 31/2 hours of constantly playing music.,0
They break or stop working and I was thinking it was my phone but it was the cord not a good buy for long term use. Every day since I wrote these people harass me and email me daily telling me to remove my comments instead of making a better product. It’s not fair and can someone at Amazon stop them from harassing me.,0
I wouldn't wear it much,0
"I was fairly happy with these LED's when I purchased them in March of 2018. My only complaint at that time was they were not dimmable as advertised. My fixtures had low and high settings, and the lights would flicker badly when set to low. Otherwise, they put out good light - Until they no longer did - All 10 LED's failed in less than 1 year, and I was left with having to reinstall the halogen lamps I replaced.",0
There is a reason this item is much less expensive than other brands...it may do what it claims but I would not trust my thousand dollar phone to be submerged for any length of time.,0
"These are soft and comfortable. However, one strap tore off in about a week.",0
"I ordered the 2-pack, there was only one glass inside.",0
Broke after a month.,0
Doesn't show up much,0
"The top rolls and the crotch rises up, I didn’t find them comfortable.",0
"This is a handsome looking knife, but it has some fatal flaws. The locking feature broke within a few days of receiving it. This is too small a knife and too sharp an edge to have the blade swinging freely without the ability to lock it open. Also, this is a really heaving object for it's small size, making it pretty much useless as a knife you would carry around, which is kind of the purpose of a small knife like this. I had to send it back for a refund.",0
Makes OUr Cats Fart!,0
Very nice all but one works but I really like them,0
"Cover fits well...different from the ipad cases since the tablet actually clicks into the case...isn’t just covered by it...it doesn’t hold the tablet in a standing position, however...just collapses when folded down",0
"Worked fine for about 9 months and now won't charge at all. The light comes on, but won't charge anything. Earlier, I had to use a samsung adaptive fast charging brick with it, but now that won't work at all.",0
Too awkward to use. They strips don't stay in place - especially on the lower row of teeth.,0
"I bought my fitness tracker and lost my charger and cannot find a replacement charger , I have ordered several chargers and can’t seem to find the right one! I also got my warranty emailed to me by amazon n the print is so small I can’t even see the link to click on. It will not reroute me to warranty and I can’t even find a phone number!!!",0
"This product is advertised as fragrance free, but it has a very strong odor like burned rubber. I had to wash it off after I put it on because of the smell.",0
Did not like my 7 plus I phone didn’t fit in it well at all,0
"We have been buying these bottles for years, but this last batch leak. No matter how carefully & tightly we screw on the bottom cap, they leak all over the place. So frustrating, because the concept is terrific. My husband & I have loved how thoroughly we can clean the bottles. Don’t know if they have changed manufacturers or what, but this is a bummer. Back to regular bottles, I guess.",0
"If you sweat anywhere at all on your body when you workout, these pants will be look very wet at the slightest touch of moisture. Not for working out. Like baggy sweats that then close circulation just below the knee...",0
"Not really sure if it actually works, but it is broken. So I am returning it after one usage and get a new one. See picture, the screw came off. Impossible to put it back without messing everything up.",0
very small. but 2 of 3 are growing,0
"These are just ok. Pretty thin, I think, and not very soft or silky. Not exactly what I was looking for but I don't want to bother returning them so I'll use them anyhow.",0
Runs small - half to a size.,0
Ok but would not read again.,0
"We didn't expect the light to change colors, but it made for a fun joke with friends. The light it very bright and attracts plenty of attention at dark. However the first light only lasted one month, almost exactly.",0
The only good point in the movie it hardly deviated from the main story. Everything else seemed illogical and senseless.,0
"Got this items and it does not spin freely as others have said. I seems like it came without lubrication for the ball bearings. The product grinds when trying to move with and without being weighed down. It seems like it would work well if it had lubrication, but I didn't pay to not have a working product out of the box.",0
"Pretty disappointed with my purchase. One of the sliding drawer pieces came bent and one of the screws for the shelf came broken. Each of the three times I’ve called, they promise it will ship the next day and it still has not. If they had better customer service I would have given them a higher rating for making up for the damage. Unfortunetly they just don’t seem to care.",0
"I didn't even try to see if it worked because when I opened the packaged and took the lid off of the product, I saw it had already been used. There was wax all inside the container, and one of the wax bead packets were already open. Did you not check the package upon return and just send it to the next victim? Not okay.",0
I sent this back. Waaayyy to big. And the material/quality wasn't good enough for me to spend almost $30.,0
Hard to view in daylight. Would not recommend.,0
"I used it at the beach once and it let water get into my phone, thank God the phone is waterproof but I’m definitely gonna pay the extra money next time for a Lifeproof, 2 stars because it is a sturdy case to protect against drops",0
"I had this cart for about three weeks and the handle broke, leaving me without a suitable cart for my supplies.",0
Brought this for my 1 year old son that has curly hair. It smells very good and leaves his hair really soft but it doesn't keep the curls moist and defined. When used while wet after the hair dries the curls look frizzy and dry.,0
On the picture the dress looked like it had flare at the bottom turns out it doesn't. It is just a straight dress that is high in the front and low in the back. Not what I expected,0
It may seem more convienent to mix all of the poweder at once but with apple cider vinegar and water it will mold quickly and it is wasted.,0
Nuts in the mix tasted old . probably wouldn't order again,0
Received product today but the box was delivered opened. Missing the mic.,0
"Not the right color of pink, but it does the job.",0
this skate board would be ok if the wheels moved normally. The bearing is so tight the wheels barley roll. I'm sending back and buying another brand.,0
"I got this charging cable three months ago in September and it doesn't work anymore. It worked fine when I first got it, but now when I plug it in my phone tells me that the connection is incomplete. For the first few days after this started popping up, my phone would still charge overnight as long as I didn't use it. But now, it won't charge it at all.",0
"Battery life was horrible, didn’t last very long. I found myself having to charge them 2-3x a day. Didn’t have them for long and only the left side would work. Not really worth it.",0
He arrived missing his gas gun.,0
"I loved my case, especially the color, but I’ve had it for just about 2 months and it’s already breaking. Unfortunately, There’s no other way for me to complain about this problem and ask for a refund/replacement other than through writing this review which is a shame because I really do love this case.",0
Ive just had the second one fail on me.....they last about 1-2 years then the LCD starts to fail. I was smart and purchase Asurion insurance with the second one......just filed a claim now - bext $4 ive purchased :) Almost feel bad making the claim as i knew probably was going to fail based on previous experience. This said....when its working the la Crosse unit is very functional and stylish.....this said they've now withdrawn it from their line....i assume because they kept failing/return rates.,0
"More black than silver, either oxidized or misadvertised. Will be returning.",0
The 6 and 10 foot are fine. The 3ft cable worked for one use and now it won't charge my phone. Okay for the price I guess.,0
I bought 2 of these for my 2 new iPhone 8s and this mount holds the phone securely to the magnet and charges the phone without an issue. Problem I have with both mounts is the phone starts to droop down as I'm driving from the weight of the phone. I don't see any screws to tighten to stiffen the joint so I might have to use some kind of glue to hold it in place. Great concept but it's a bit cheaply made and the quality shows.,0
"The ladder will not close when shelf is installed. If I had known that, I would have purchased a different brand.",0
They buzz loudly and the tape does not stick so they fall down. Not worth the price at all,0
"I love this item, however the cap was loose on arrival and honey leaked out inside the bubble wrap. Very disappointed since this is an expensive item.",0
"This mat is attractive, easy to clean and store away. one BIG issue is the poor sewing of the 4 corner loops for pegging down to the ground. The plastic loops are ""barely"" tacked with plastic tread so the 1st mat we purchased, 2 of the corner loops pulled free. I was able to sew them with HEAVY threat to remedy the problem. We did purchase a 2nd mat and I PRE-sewed those before use. The only other issue is with large dog TOENAILS puncturing the plastic weave. Our bloodhounds are young an d rambunctious so they have torn a few strips by running across the mat. Little toy dog breeds will not have the same issues.",0
they were too large I'm a woman's size 81/2 and I was not given an option to choose a size.,0
Loved this mouse when I first got it...but it only lasted less than 6 months before it died... :(,0
I haven’t even had this for 6 months and the rubber edges are all peeling off.,0
"The book was written a long time ago and you could tell, oh; and it was an English writer. Maybe that was the problem. It was very dull but I did finish it weeks after I started it.",0
Order said 50 boxes I only received 27 boxes!,0
Compared to other brands this one isn’t great - it’s cheaper in price and quality....tossed it and ordered a better brand - live and learn ya get what ya pay for,0
Not tips. Full nails. Not good for what I wanted. But theres a lot of size choices.,0
It has only one LED bulb on each spotlight. Other comparable products have four bulbs each. I thought this could still work but the amount of light it’s on is only around 3 hours a night. I’m returning this.,0
One of the earrings had the dangling crystal installed backwards so the pointy part of the crystal was facing forward and one was correct.,0
"I use these gloves to handle hot cast iron pans. If I hold on to the pans too long, I can burn myself. I haven't burned my hands, but it gets extremely hot. These are not anywhere near as heat resistant as the pictures would have you believe. They show a flame underneath a glove -- yes, the glove won't burn, but your hands will.",0
I did notice if you could order it in firm. I got a neck ache.,0
First track is the best. Kind of boring otherwise. No originality of guitar tone or riffs. Heard it all before. Expected more as he was highly hyped as the next torch bearer of the blues.,0
Purchased light in April 2019 and really enjoyed it for 3 months. Then the dimmer/brighter switch sensor stopped working. Then it started turning itself on & off. Have it now set at brightness I can tolerate-will only work properly if I unplug it when I use it! Would not recommend.,0
An Auto shut-off would be great...bottle gets too hot if you don’t stand in front of the warmer to watch. Which defeats the purpose of having a bottle warmer in the first place...,0
Not sure my grandson uses this,0
Grateful bottle was wrapped in plastic as lid was unscrewed and product was leaking out.,0
"Used as described, first time use, it hold but when finish out day found it bent. I was not expecting something like this for the price, the item and finishing looks well made but it seems material is too weak. Very disappointed",0
Not sure about every one else but the sticky part to actually lift does not stick quite well. I find myself constantly readjusting.,0
"this vac does a great job of cleaning ashes and soot from my pellet stove, right up until it just shut off and won't start again. It is only 2 months old and not over used. Very disappointing. I am going to order another one hoping this one was just flawed, if the next one stops before a year goes by, I won't order it again.",0

Gerbils chewed up this hut in less than a day. Nothing was left but tiny scraps.,0
"I ordered two routers and they came packaged and appearing to be new but after several hours of trying to figure out why one was not showing up on my network although it was working, I eventually figured out it had a manually assigned IP address unrelated to any address I use and I had to factory reset the device in order to get it to work correctly. So clearly this thing was packaged as new but it was not. I will see if it works it seems to be working but I am quite concerned that I received a router with pre-existing information programmed inside of it.",0
Not even close to the good ol' cartoon. Had to stop after 15 minutes.,0
It was not what I expected at all from the description on web site.,0
Poor quality. Very disappointed. I usually love the Zebra pens. The pen inside the case already had chipped marks on the design.,0
"My goodness, my poor armpit, pinched my skin so bad . I really don’t like this electric razor , I go over one area for so many times just for one piece of hair .",0
"Fit as expected, however there was a defect on the sleeve that i didn’t notice until after I washed it.",0
comfy at first but wears down fairly quickly. stretched out and slips off feet when walking,0
"I like the look of this band, really dresses up my fitbit. the clasp, however, is ridiculously hard to open and close. I was able to remove a link with the tool provided but there are no instructions provided at all. Would not buy again.",0
"Unfortunately, these strainers developed rust spots after their first use.",0
"If you are looking for a ton of stickers to use as rewards and care more about quantity than quality, these would work for you. These stickers are good for the price, but that's about it. The designs are not very well drawn, and the stickers fall off of the plastic very easily. When they are put onto something else (like a plastic name tag lanyard), they are difficult to remove, resulting in the sticky half staying stuck and the front half ripping off.",0
Easy to install but there’s still bubbling all around the edges. The edges are raised off of the watch face so you can tell there’s a protector on it and hair and lint will more than likely get caught on it.,0
"I have bought two of these already, the cap keeps breaking. If you don't tighten it down enough it leaks, but you can easily over tighten it and break the cap. I was very careful this time and it still happened. Would like to just but more caps but cant find them separate. Be careful with the cap.",0
"Very cute but Way to small! They are 6.5"" in width (open) 6.5"" L but the holder plastic part is 3"" and very flimsy! and Not eligible for refund!",0
"This is not good quality, and will not hold much weight, card board bottoms bend. A little stronger built would improve this product.",0
I wanted to take these for at least a month before writing the review. They did help with some of the symptoms of PCOS BUT I wanted it to help me ovulate and instead I've been spotting for 3 days 2 weeks after taking them. My periods are normally regular so I've never done this before. My period wasn't due for another week when I started spotting. Disappointed):,0
The main issue with this ped is it shuts off all the time. I dropped it once and it to me a couple days to get it to work again. I would not buy another.,0
For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me. They bag and roll behind the knee with the extra material and don't lay right since they are too long. I would also suggest to size down since they run big in my opinion.,0
Stopped working after one day of use Music and sound continued but blew 1-3 bubbles after using for an hour(vs multiple ),0
"I really wanted to like these. So cute hanging on a hook on my fridge! Unfortunately that's all they are good for. There's no thumbs and they don't bend, so it's really impractical to pick anything up.",0
"In theory these should work well, however, I could not get these to stay in place once they’ve been used a couple of times. Once they start falling off, they are useless and makes breastfeeding frustrating.",0
"I love these shelves but I was pissed when I went to put them up. The metal washer covers don't fit over all the plastic washer. So, I was stuck leaving the ugly black plastic washers showing. Very upsetting. You can't tell this at first glance either unless you physically put the washers inside of a metal piece.",0
These liners were very short and does not provide needed coverage.,0
I was so excited to receive and use this...they arrived broken. A replacement is being sent but highly suggest better packaging to avoid broken products.,0
"Each of these operates on 3 triple A batteries which they burn through rapidly. Plus, they are not nearly as bright as suggested. Find another source. I query the rave reviews.",0
Sent it back because it’s much bigger than a normal wallet,0
"This was too much detail on things I already understand, so for me, it wasn’t a good selection. That being said, if you are just starting out on making lifestyle changes for managing auto immune issues this is a great book for you.",0
"Not going to last long, used it one day and corners are already chipping",0
Didn’t remove hair very well,0
Very tight fit in the fingers. Hand fit is good. Never have had to wear a workout glove larger than a large.,0
"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.",0
Its splitting apart.,0
Does the job but not stylish,0
Not so good and my dog destroy it within three days... Maybe my dog is too strong.,0
"I've been using these gripper gloves for years now, but this year the ones that arrived have some very odd shapes for the phalanges. The thumb gripper section now curls inward so that part of the thumb joint isn't protected in the inside but the outside of the knuckle is covered and irritated by the rubber. The same goes with the fingers and the Large gloves aren't very large any more and I had to struggle to get my not-so-fleshy fingers into the gloves. It would be nice if the sizes were just a bit smaller, but with the odd shapes I don't know if I'll be repeating an online order for these next time and instead find them in a local store so I can try them on first.",0
"I did not notice any difference. I wanted it to work, but even with the Placebo effect I did not feel anything.",0
"I was initially very happy with the 2 bowls I received. I use them as water bowls for my dogs. However after about 4 months, the inside of the bowls are covered with rust spots.",0
The taste was wasn't very good,0
"Quality of cover was not as expected, showed wear lines after one week of use",0
"It does the job. The is always a little feedback. Unfortunately, when you plug in the phone to charge, the feedback gets kicked up to an uncomfortable level.",0
"The proportions of the pants did not fit my body. The pants were snug in the legs (as desired), but it was way too big in the waist. I am 5'3, 120 lbs and I ordered an xs. I fear the xxs would be too tight in the legs. I am returning this item.",0
Gave me horrible gas. Did not like taste.,0
"Good concept as personally I need one lease Forbes bicycling one for driving one for other. Problem 1/3 lens doesn’t work it won’t snap in. Going to keep it, but this is a vendor quality control issue they need to address. In my case black lense is cut to short, so won’t snap in. The frame fit on my head is very comfortable so is the nose piece.",0
"I am giving this 2 stars because I don't like how close his goatee is to his nose, it looks like a mustache or even like a mouth. The paint for it should have been lower.",0
"I wanted to love this suit!! The pattern is adorable! I ordered an XL (I’m usually a 10-12, between medium and large in pants and tops) so I thought it would be plenty big enough. It barely covered my behind and left me with lots of side boob. After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me! The suit I got was the same as the first picture in description. Cute print and nice fabric, but def not for me",0
"Gave as Christmas gift, stopped working 3 mos. later. Very disappointed because it was a nice product and gave off a good amount of humidity to the air unlike some. I also thought it had a nice style. My return windo is closed unfortunately.",0
Napkins are really pretty but very hard. They are like sandpaper!,0
"I weigh 165lbs and typically wear a medium size in top and large at the bottom. The top is way too big and the padding is very odd. It looks unflattering. It would look better on someone who has a bigger chest. However, I did like the bottoms, but they are pretty revealing. Also the color in the picture is way off from the color i actually received. Overall I'm disappointed with this purchase.",0
Does not accommodate phone calls from iPhone. Listening to music while charging works however does not allow for phone calls on iPhone,0
"Nice brushes and low price cost of 2 pack. My son loves the colours of the brushes, but feel small in his hand. Also ,very small brush tooo. I would like to say not cleaned well, just ok.",0
Look else ware. Not really a great quality product.,0
Very sticky...leaves a white residue on furniture,0
"Juvenile and boring. The mechanics were reasonably well done,with the exception of sentence structure, missing words. A selected read and a volunteered review.",0
Looks good fits a kid too small,0
"Even after 12 hours, there were still some bubbles watched the video amd followed the steps. Customer service is solid as well.",0
"They are not that bright, easy to install.",0
ONE OF THE GRABBERS WILL NOT LOCK EXTENDED. CUPS ON BOTH ARE NOT REPLACEABLE. BOTH VERY WOBBLEY WHEN EXTENDED. CHEAPLY MADE! NOT A GOOD BUY!,0
Some of the lids were bent and the glass had air bubbles in places. I needed them and had to keep but the quality could have been better,0
Gets caught in loops where velcro meets,0
The cleaning brush was not included. Straws are what I thought though.,0
Bought 42mm for my series 3 .It looks good and exactly in the given picture however the strap loosens up very often .Not comfortable after you wear it for more than 15 minutes.The only good thing is that it comes from the protector which is quite useful to avoid any scratches .Overall disappointed with this strap.Have taken it off and gone back to the original sports strap from Apple.,0
Sturdiness or lack of,0
"Looks like circus tent material, but it fits well on the bed and looks a bit better than nothing if you want to hide stuff you keep under your bed.",0
This did not have an adaptor to fix the tubing needed for my small outdoor fountain. Also the plug is not intended to be used outdoors as it is not waterproof or grounded (three prong). And very short cord.,0
Not as described and it’s missing element to the female elf ... bottom trim looks bad ... I had it delivered to someone to customize it and I’m really upset that it wasn’t put together better !,0
Had I know that this item was this small I would never have paid more than $5.00 for this product. I could’ve gotten these at Target for half the price I paid. What a waste!,0
"Applied these rubbed then as much as possible , daughter woke up and most were on the floor . The color is wasn’t quite Rose gold . Bummer what a waste and can’t return",0
"I was bummed the edges of the card holders were smushed, I'm not able to straighten them, hopefully the recipients don't notice.",0
Read closely....it's an expansion set...not the game,0
Not very flexible so you will need extension arms to properly direct your GoPro.,0
Nice quality but THE STAKES ARE TOO LONG!!! There is no way for me to get in in the ground far enough without the sign sticking up too far off the ground. It looks ridiculous. I'm going to have to take it somewhere to have the stakes shortened. I love the look of the sign but it is not worth the frustration so far.,0
You get what you pay for. Clasp always comes undone and change spills out.,0
"Did not work for me. Too big in the midsection, and too short. Not a flattering look at all.",0
Using this case has caused very poor sound quality through my daughters phone. Voice is muffled to the point you can’t understand anything she is saying.,0
Product was perfect shipping was incredibly slow...,0
I returned it because it did not work!,0
"I wish this had worked because I really like the scent, but it gave me a horrible rash.",0
"First of all I'd like to know who got the devilish idea to add pockets to all dresses sold on Amazon. This is a really nightmare! The dress fit, and it's beautiful but because I do have large hips as an hourglass shape, the pockets make me look even larger. This is so disheartening. I hope I'll find a nice dress for my next trip to Jamaica!",0
"Broke on first use, the cast aluminum is not strong with medium torque from screw clamps. But it's really cheap, maybe if your building bird houses it would be a good buy.",0
I ordered the yellow colored one. It is way too bright. Feels slippery on feet especially according to the kids when they walk/run.,0
"I love how it plays sound on my stream while connected to my el gato as well talk to my pals, but it only lasted for a week until the cords stopped working. If it would’ve lasted longer I would give more ratings.",0
I picked this book because the story had potential. Prologue was well written and gives you that thrill of anticipation for the next page. Then the first chapter happened...the POV writing was choppy and full cliches. I really tried to finish this book but more of the same on the next chapters and I lost interest.,0
"I tried and tried, but the top and bottom corners of these panels curled and fell out repeatedly. I washed the windows first. I cut and then let the panels warm up, I wetted with soapy water. I used a squeegee. I even tried to hold the tops in place with double sided tape, and the bottoms curled up too. I'm very disappointed and have to come up with another idea. And FYI, if you are close to the panels, you can see what's on the side.",0
Ordered the new style strap locks but received the old style! The old style is still a great product but I didn't order it!,0
Did not see a difference in my pores after religiously using it every night for a month.,0
"The taste is horrible. It is so artificial tasting that I have to chug it down. It does seem to do good, I am less sore after working out taking this. If they could make the taste less artificial it would be a great product.",0
"The cuffs are exactly as the picture shows. However, I lost one with in the first hour of wearing them because you can not adjust the size.",0
Wore these for the first time today. Had to come home and soak my feet in Epsom salt water. Were ok for about an hour. Did not provide much cushion. I'm a high school administrator and walk a lot on tile floors. I really needed these to work.,0
"Bought because of the good review A diamond already fell out after wearing it for 4 days. I guess that’s what I get for the price. The color and style is beautiful, but that’s about it!",0
"Does not stay on wall, falls off after I put a couple half-empty spice jars on each stripe.",0
Right out of the plastic several of these were dirty. Won’t be reordering.,0
"Comfortable, but NOT worth the $!",0
Is this really white air dry clay? Maybe it's going to dry white? Much darker color than expected.,0
I wanted to give these five stars but the dark green has already died after coloring one small area. The rest are going strong after much more coloring but I'm bummed not to have a full set right after the first use.,0
did not fit standard bar size. they resent free and still did not fit.,0
This may is no good to me because it won't work on tubes that have any type of texture on the tub. It would be nice if you have that in your description. The tub has to be totally smooth to use.,0
"Used the X-Heavy about once or twice a week for a month or so. Would put it around ankles and walk with it up and down room 4 times. It snapped the other day. They were ok, wish they were more durable and stronger, felt as though the X-Heavy wasn't as heavy as should have been. The other bands are way too light.",0
worked wonderfully for two months then stopped working.,0
I noticed a couple of keys functions are backwards. I have to press a different key every time to place in my password. Not very happy about it.,0
Wear a mask and open the windows! The smell is externally strong! I followed the instructions and this did not come out smooth. It’s very rough. I thought well maybe that’s just how it goes on so I continue with my 2 additional coats for 3 coats total but now it’s been 24 hours and it’s rough everywhere. I’m at a loss on what to do. I bought 2 cans as I wanted to do my shower floor but I’m not sure I’m going to do it. I think I might buy the actual paint for that. Only giving this 2 stars bc of the convenience of having a spray instead of paint.,0
No weight baring at all!!,0
One came already broken 😢,0
One wire broke after a few uses. Not recommended.,0
"At first I thought this product would be beneficial. I used it a number of times and it did seem to offer some comfort. Eventually I tried the heat and discovered that there was no heat. That was a deal breaker since that was a big reason for purchasing this product. Also, I started hearing noises coming from the product (popping) that were not there initially. No heat, can't keep. So I am returning this immediately. This has probably soured me on these type of massagers since all of them seem to be made in China and the quality is dubious. I had hoped to find something that would relieve my neck arthritis pain but obviously I must keep looking.",0
You need a red bulb in order for them to flash but only one of the 3 sets I bought has them.,0
Cable connection fits well. The cable does not always charge. Not a fan of these cables.,0
"I ordered the Pro-Team Vacuum Cleaner and the suggested bags the the advertisement. The bags are the wrong size. Can I return them or am I stuck with what I ordered. Thank you, Curtis White",0
"After 5 or 6 washings, these socks lost their elasticity at the top, causing the sock to fall inside my shoes beneath my heel. Find a better quality product.",0
"I really loved this backpack; however, after only 3 uses the bag started to leak where the ""straw"" connects to the bladder. No matter how I clicked it in it would still leak and not a slow leak either.",0
"Having been a fan since the beginning of this series,always looking forward to next book, was very disappointed with this book. Great lead ins,not enough follow thru. Seems more of someone else writing as the author I have followed for so many years. Far too much material devoted to language,etc. at end of the book. Would have appreciated as much attention in the story as had been displayed years prior . Where the author had .great story lines and interactions, they have become shortened and far more time added to sexual interactions. Far more erotica than story,which is of course the easier route. No more awaiting so anxiously for next installment as I would rather re-read her her earlier works which had substance.",0
"Not flattering at all. Loved the print and the material was nice and thick. Good quality but the cut of the dress is not good. It doesn't hang all cute like the pic, but more like a think, stiffer flannel.",0
One of the bracelets was broken and I was one bracelet short of how many I was supposed to get. A little disappointed.,0
very lightweight and easy to spill litter when cleaning. you have to keep a good grip on it.,0
"Doesn’t fit my surface go and doesn’t leave the upper camera spot open, completely blocked the view.",0
"OK, you would think I would return it - however, the issue was that the gem in the middle was not attached, had come loose. Whatever they stuck it now with didn't hold. Crazy glue holds it just fine. so - for a cheap item, it's just fine.",0
"I am not a fan of how works with my OtterBox, one side of the protective screen is up and I can't get it to sit flat with my case. It was definitely easy to install, but I don't think it's very adhesive.",0
Sellers did not specify that the keyboard and pen were NOT included even though they have it pictured,0
"Pieces fit together loosely; top you can almost just slide on versus screw on. The bottom piece does fit a little better than the top. Not a big fan of the little door on the side; has a tendency to drop the contents; although, it doesnt have any issues staying shut unless opened at the moment. Overall, not too bad and the ""pollen"" catcher works very well. Update Had for little over a month. Magnet that holds the door has now come out and won't keep shut. Not very well made",0
"The desciption needs to be changed to PU leather, NOT LEATHER! this is wrong!!!!",0
"very stiff, still can't shape it well",0
Nice mirror works well on ezgo mounting brackets will need to be trimmed otherwise they will look ridiculous. I was also only given one thumb screw/knob which sucks but it's not worth the trouble to ship it back over that.,0
I thought the key portion was detachable like the one I bought a few years ago. I had to buy one that didn't have the key.,0
We live in a valley and the 15 mile an hour wind gusts completely destroyed it within a week of putting it up.,0
"Good for washing windows or power-spraying your house, but I wouldn't use that sprayer on a garden.",0
These sheets are soft as silk but they snag badly!😞,0
May be good solution for some not knocking the product itself. But for me they didn’t work. Not realistic at all but like I said others may love!,0
"I didn't know that Tony Hillerman's daughter had taken up the reins to continue his Leaphorn/Chee legacy - I used to love those books. ""Cave of Bones"" was pretty good and brought back fond memories of the books, the characters, and the Southwest country... I enjoyed that one, so I tried this one (the author's first effort). But it's pretty weak. Shallow characterization; repetitive; some too-obvious clues/details. Oh well. Somewhere between this book and ""Cave of Bones"" her style and plotting must have improved, so maybe I'll try a few others.",0
I purchased the item about 2 months ago. The fist few weeks the items was great then the watch started to freeze. I would have a blank screen at times the watch does the basic. There are some glitches,0
"I recommend this product to everyone - so many compliments and when I tell them the price, it's unreal. Second pair that's broken....know get what you pay for, but disappointed.",0
Sturdy but it doesn't transfer heat as well as other water bottles U have used. The large opening is nice and it seems to be holding up well.,0
They are soft sheets. I only bought them for the cooling feature. They do NOT cool at all!!!! Do not buy for this feature.,0
"I love this brand, but this is by far the worst scent they have. It does not smell anything like Jasmine. I highly recommend the orange blossom scent. Give this one a by.",0
Plastic had white streaks.. Glue on application strips was old and not sticky..,0
"Just not the quality I am used to from Brooks. I have worn Brooks for 25 years due to heavier support, these don't measure up.",0
The concept of this would be great but the silicone band (for preventing slipping) is not stretchy enough and makes it impossible to get over my hips. And my hips are not that large... I'm not convinced it would be all that comfortable for a petite person either since the fabric is more stretchy than the silicone. I ended up sending this one back.,0
Mine already broke. Within 2 weeks. Not worth. Better off duct taping my old charger.,0
"I really like this bag. It was a gift, and I did not have a chance to use it for several months after I received it . The zipper broke on the first use. It has been too long to return it at this point.",0
One of the things I like about the pixelbook is the keyboard responsiveness and how fast and easy it is to type. This cover is too restrictive and not as responsive as others I've used. It drastically slows typing speed. I have to press harder and backspace to fix corrections too often to make this cover worth it.,0
"The fit was perfect and I love the light blue color. However, after I wore it one time and hand washed and air dryed the suit, part of the material changed color. It has gray areas all over it. I'm very disappointed. I don't understand why better material wasn't used because it felt great on!",0
"They are cute but too light and made of thin metal. The handle is a bit short. It would be good if they made the utensil handle a bit longer and heavier. Except for the giraffe design, nothing special about the spoon and fork. One fork I received damaged.",0
Ordered four and one of the four will not work! I am disappointed!,0
Does not really do much of a difference. My wife stopped using it and was disappointed.,0
It lasted a month and it started to tear on the side and then tore up.,0
"Although it appears to be a genuine Sony battery, it held less charge when I got it in 2017 than the battery that came with the camera that was a couple of years older. Now, after 1 year it will no longer take a charge. Probably a quality control issue as others have said. I've just purchased another from Amazon, as Sony lists Amazon as an official retailer. I'm hoping it will do better. 2019 update. I'll stick with my 2 star rating. The battery I got appears to be a genuine Sony and has the hologram. However, it doesn't hold a charge as well as the one that came with the camera back in 2014. The 2014 battery weighs 2 oz and the 2017 battery weighs 1.5 oz, which goes a long way to explaining the poorer performance.",0
"I LOVE THE SIZE BUT DOESNT PULL SMOKE & ODERS OUT. THE ODERS INSTEAD OF SUCKING IN, THEY SEEM TO BLOW OUT.",0
The butterfly was flat and bigger than the picture,0
"Well made, good price.after washing, dye ran lines diwn front of jeans",0
"Bought this after I gave birth to lighten the line of my tummy. Didn't do anything but exfoliate the skin... although, the line did gas over time without the cream",0
"The fit doesn’t quite work well with Phillips light strips, and the tabs tend to bend sideways when clamping the closure shut, which shorts out the color circuits and prevents you from being able to change colors to anything from white. The tabs have plastic retaining bits which prevent you from sliding the strip in because of the solder, so you have to bend the strip to get them to fit or try to clip out the plastic. I had better results just soldering the connectors to the strip itself. Definitely not worth the asking price.",0
I just unboxed this freezer and its dented in multiple locations. Not what I expected from Amazon. I should have read all of the negative reviews because this apparently an issue with this brand. I plugged it in and it appears to be working. Bought a matching mini fridge at the same time and it is in a similar condition.,0
"Physically well constructed, but the sound is muffled and bad. Also the battery life seems sub-par.",0
"The groovy papaya colorway has a scripted champion logo stitched on on the picture on Amazon, but what came was a hoodie with just the ""c"" logo on the top right of the chest",0
The magnetic backing came unglued from the base first use,0
Gets linty quick it's more of q cotton martial,0
First of all it took forever to get going. The thriller part doesn't even begin until halfway through the book. It gets interesting for awhile and then boom...it just over. Really unsatisfying ending. If this was a movie I'd say wait until it shows up on cable. I gave it two stars because it had potential otherwise I would have given one star.,0
"Initially I fell in love with this protector, that was until my phone fell and my glass cracked WITH THE PROTECTOR ON",0
"I've been using this product with success for over a year. They've just repackaged it along with an apparent change in flavor. While the texture is finer than before, I find the new resulting flavor distasteful and probably will stop using the product.",0
"some of the packets were empty, peppermint and thyme. The seed for paragon and rosemary did not grow. I contacted the seller and was told sometime the packet are empty in error, was told they would send me those seeds, never did. Then the rosemary and tarragon did not grow. disappointing",0
"Purchased 4 for our family. We used 2 yesterday. The plastic is not durable. Within an hour, one of the cases got a small hole in the plastic and the other had some condensation inside. Luckily, we noticed before too much water got in and caused damage. We tested the products as suggested last week and didn't notice any problema",0
I liked how thick the product was also very sticky but it was very difficult to install and had a lot of air bubbles underneath that I was unable to remove,0
"The product started working well, good sound quality and battery life. After 4 uses, the on off switch started to fail and now does not work at all.",0
Doesn't do a good job measuring smaller increments.,0
Cool product but did not last long. I wish I can contact a buyer to see if they can send me a new one.,0
Didn't know that this type of hammer is not good neuro exams...,0
It is the perfect color green and it arrived on schedule. The stickers are not sticky enough and do not stay where they were put. The keep peeling up on the edges of the X Box and on the curves of the controller.,0
This product was supposed to come with 30 stickers. I only got 23.,0
The image portrayed in this advertisement but lead you to believe that you are ordering pillows order some pillow covers and looking for pillows and ran into this advertisement once I order they came they were the same as the order I had before just covers,0
To long and thin for my use. Had to return it.,0
"The gold paint they used on the balloons damaged the balloons. Almost all of the balloons popped, even ones we barely filled with air. Some of the balloons had holes in them where the gold paint was.",0
Ordered because of the low price. But my 2 year old goes through these all the time.,0
"Rod came in a large box with ZERO packing material. Just a rod in a box, that was way too big. Lots of room to shift around. Rod tip guide was destroyed, I had to replace. Poor effort on the seller for sure.",0
"The pillow is comfortable enough, but I’ve only had it two months and a big hole has already ripped in the case. Good thing I only need it to last three more months. Hopefully the whole thing doesn’t disintegrate by then.",0
This is much smaller than my previous companies.,0
I loved this organizer until one side of each of the two handles broke after only about 4 months of use.,0
"These are bikini, not hipster. Returned.",0
I have been using this app for a year now and I have been liking it but recently its showing me inappropriate products. I don't know how to get this to stop or contact customer service. may have to delete app for this app for reason. I never searched for any of these items so I don't know why I'm seeing them.,0
Not sure if it's the product or just a sensitive dog but she got sick 2 times out of 3 after eating just half an ear. Luckily she wasn't majorly sick but I threw them out.,0
"I wanted to like this; the material it was made out of was very soft and it was a nice size for what I needed. However, this support is too soft for its own good. What good is a back SUPPORT that just squishes as you lean into it? Unfortunately, this SUPPORT did nothing but squish for me, and I returned it. If you're truly looking for SUPPORT I'd look elsewhere.",0
"Ok, so I heard that this could be used in the backseat for cup holders if your vehicle doesn't have them.. um. no. The fastening slots are open at the bottom, plus they are small, so lacing a seat belt through is pointless. Comes off immediately. It's lightweight so it will fly off the seat if you stop even slightly suddenly. I'm giving 2 stars because it is sturdy, lightweight, and inexpensive- but it's fastening system means it is not secure in your car.",0
I bought these thinking it would be the same as the eddy kids water bottle but bigger. The straw is different and gets clogged with air bubbles. My kids often bring me these bottles to “fix” because the straw doesn’t work correctly,0
Shoes are very slippery. There’s no grip on soles of shoes.,0
They look nice. But these are not completely stainless. I haven’t even installed mine yet and there is already surface rust on the welded joints.,0
Had to buy batteries for it even though there were 3 in the handle. They were dead since the light was in the on position. Not real happy about that.,0
As far as nutritional value it appears to be high-quality the taste is unbearable and why I rated it at 2 star it does help to put honey in your glass with it.,0
was good when worked but device manager stopped recognizing it soon after working for sometime.Would not recommend it .,0
Very flimsy. I'm paranoid everytime I put a can of soda in it. It means and spreads a bit I wouldn't put a big drink in this at all and trust that it would hold it.,0
The product is good. Wish it just presented it self more information.,0
It states this curtain can be used as is for a shower however upon the first use it became quite saturated and this continued after my next few showers. I gave up and had to get a clear liner because I didn't want mold.,0
If you have celiac or are gluten-free these vitamins are not for you. I hate swallowing pills and was disappointed when I saw the Natrol fast dissolves have wheat. So I am hoping they will let me return them.,0
Corner seam opposite the hose inlet delaminates over a foot with no one near the pool in the first 40 minutes . Grandsons really liked it and hope the replacement holds up for the month of July while they are visiting. Also many holes stream outward versus into the pool as shown. Hope that is better in the second one as well.,0
"I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.",0
It looks like some of the silicon went a little bonkers in the dishwasher the first time I washed one in there. It also annoyed me how the metal flowing through the center doesn't go all the way to the end of the handle. Will return and spend my money for better quality.,0
First time using this for a keto tortilla and really don't like the taste and texture. Also the dough turns purple (I read with some brands that happens) Will continue to try it in others receipts to see if I get used to it,0
"It's a huge disappointment. The fabric is perfect for my needs but the quality of the threads is just terrible. I've been wearing for 6 months for regular weightlifting and it's already worn. There threads are now lose and compression is lost, even though I ordered a size larger specifically to avoid putting too much pressure on the material, since it was already pointed out in other reviews that there is an issue with durability. In comparison, my under armour compression shorts have lasted for 5 years under the same type of training. I am ordering from Canada so it doesn't make any sense to be buying these considering the extra cost of importing.",0
Thisnis a mirrored window cling. It doesnt tell you this but the cling side is the clear side and the outer side is the mirrored side. This will only give you the mirrored effect to the outside if you place on the outside if your window exposed to the elements which defeats the entire purpose. A waste of my time...,0
Kept saying that it wasn’t supported by Apple,0
The zipper pouch in the front has a cheap zipper and mine broke off rather quickly.,0
"I ordered pink locks, got purple!",0
"Firstly don't believe the rating here. Fakespot.com gives it a ranking of D, which means it is very likely that there are a lot of fake good reviews here. Pro: The robot is a new category of toy, or you can even call it a pet. It go explore by itself and it does not require a phone to do so. It wakes up in the morning and wanders around and makes cute noise. It greets you when you get home (you have to make sure that he hears you and sees your face though). In summary, being autonomous is a major pro that you can't see from other products. Cons: 1: too slow in processing your command. I think the chip is from 2015. So can't expect too much in terms of processing speed. Also you can't expect it to be that smart because of this. 2. Edge detection is just NOT GOOD ENOUGH. Sometimes it just runs at full speed and falls directly off the edge. The worst part is that sometimes when it's right on the edge, it misunderstands to be on air. This causes it to act irritated and shake its arms and fall off. I don't think this is merely a problem of software. 3. It gets boring. Soon you'll realize its movements and responses are just algorithms and predictable. You get bored of it after no longer than a week. A toy is just a toy at the end. You don't want to spend $250 and eventually forget about it. In summery. It is a new and interesting experience to have a robot like this. But it is still very limited and you get bored of it very quickly. If you have extra money and really want the new experience, just get it. If you're debating whether to get it or not, don't trust the positive reviews here and forget about it -- it does not worth $250 (or even $150) yet.",0
Nothing special at all about this product... the book is too small and stiff and hard to write in. The huge sticker on the back doesn’t come off and looks super tacky. I would not purchase this again. I could have just bought a journal from the dollar store and it would be basically the same thing. It’s also really expensive for what it is.,0
"Not all that great, hard to adjust, field of view isn’t wonderful",0
Not very sturdy. They are very fragile and thin. Sent back!,0
These were smaller than expected and the material wasn't very soft as described. They are also not high-waisted as stated in the description,0
"was expired, not a good product =burned back of throat.-- do not buy",0
Was excellent when it first came out! Doesn't look the same,0
"Cards are ok — as pictured. But the packaging is wasteful and unnecessary. I’m sure a huge percentage of price is for the overkill packaging, which is a nightmare to open and then it gets trashed.",0
"As many other people state here, once motion is detected it takes forever for it to start recording video. I had a mailman come, rattle around in my mailbox for a good minute, then walk away. The arlo only recorded the back of his head as he moved away. Definitely regret purchasing this.",0
This battery doesn't last very long; the original from the phone that I bought 3 years ago last longer.,0
"being 9800 mah thought they would last longer than they do and the chargers dont hold the batteries to well,they keep popping out,has taken up to 8 hrs to charge a battery, wouldn't recommend these batteries",0
"After weeks of experiment, my crayfish does not eat these pellets any more. My crayfish prefer algae tablets or fish flakes. The mystery snails are not interested either. These pellets just melt away in the tank after few hours.",0
"Works and light weight, but easy to get all the sheets wet and clumped together which turns all the sheets into a thin bar of soap. Not user friendly, which is a bummer because they are light weight and work well as soap.",0
"ok, so I read the reviews before buying. I noticed there were a lot of people saying that it will come off on your clothes and what not. I have to fairly and honestly score it at 50% which I would think is an F.... but it is half of 100% so I gave it 3 stars. This stuff at first looked like it worked GREAT. I had restored the bad spots really well and I did it over several days adding on dye and letting dry in the hot garage. While i was moving it a little sweat fell on it from my face.... I went to wipe it off and with the sweat came due as well.... TALK ABOUT A BUMBER! So I took a wet cloth and wiped it... Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again.",0
"I was looking for an inexpensive pair of Bluetooth headphones for the gym. Bought these bc of the charging case and sleek look. Didn’t expect them to sound as good as actual AirPods. Instead they are on par with headphones I’ve gotten at $5 Below. Absolute rubbish. Again, I wasn’t expecting much in the sound quality department...but these are brutal. No way to enjoy music with these. Do yourself a favor and spend a few more dollars for something with any sort of quality.",0
"This book doesn't do a great job of describing the sights to see. I wish it provided more detailed descriptions, directions, and history. It does provide some sample itineraries which is nice. To me, the gold standard of travel books is Rick Steve's Italy and this doesn't come close.",0
It seems to run small yet the arms run so long you have to fold the sleeves if you want to wear it. It doesn’t look good that way. I also had a hard time deciphering the front from the back because neither way for right. I’ll never wear this. I have it two stars versus one because the look of it is exactly what I was hoping for.,0
It arrived in good time... But I have had the messager less than a month and it no longer works... Not very impressed with the quality.,0
Bought this to use for a vehicle camera and it doesn’t format properly for the camera... then doesn’t work at all after trying to use it for a tablet,0
And big plot holes. Big enough to drive a truck-bomb through.,0
"Fits big. I bought this dress (short sleeve). Not flattering at all. It looks like it was meant for a much older woman. It would look great on a senior who doesn’t mind wearing a shorter dress, or maybe to be comfy around the house. I plan to return it.",0
1 week of use and the small candle stops recharging. Returned.,0
I bought this to help keep my sons curls soft and moisture . So far I haven’t noticed any change.,0
"I bought these for my son - because little boy fingernails are always filthy. I wanted something easy for him to hold (he’s three) so he can do it by himself...the problem is that these are NOT soft at all. Super stiff, hard bristles. I don’t recommend these for small children.",0
Great product if it would stay in the car plug. For some reason it kept pushing out.,0
They were large as described but my dogs had them falling apart in about 10 minutes. Would not reorder,0
The cord broke after about 6 months of light use. It’s a shame as it sounded pretty good up until now.,0
"I ordered this projector because my 3 year old BenQ started to overheat after 5 minutes of use. When I got this new BenQ, the speaker/sound from it rattled like a loose marble was in the internal speaker. I am very weary of BenQ quality after 2 projector disappointments.",0
What I like the most is the easy clean up ... nothing sticks! What I like the least is that only two of the pans will work on my induction cooker. Neither small sauce pan nor the small skillet are recognizable to the cooker causing a no pan error code.,0
Not as good as I expected it to be. Have to continue to pump it to make it work.,0
it shows green glowing eyes light on picture but mine came blue,0
"I liked it okay while it lasted... I really loved this case when I bought it. However it cracked & leaked out. In addition, the lip needs to be a little bit bigger around the edge of the phone. I’ve gone through MANY, MANY Bodyguardz screen protectors with this case.",0
Didn’t work for me. Second brand I’ve tried.,0
"I like it ok... one charging port won’t even work and one of the others is very finicky. If the cord plugged into it wiggles the wrong way, it won’t charge.",0
This product died after a month. When it did work seems like there was a delay in the voice and th e people on screen talking.,0
My dogs chewed them off in a couple days.,0
"These just fall off your feet. If you are going to buy them anyway, get a size or two smaller.",0
"Even after several hours of charging, mirror failed to turn on light. Eventually after touching the switch (???) several times, it did turn on. And then had to touch it several times again to turn it off. Did not seem to have three light intensities. ""Manual"" (?) 2 1/2 x 3 1/2"" instruction was less than helpful. Only good things to say - design is pretty and it arrived on time.",0
This product had sketchy packaging. I requested a refund and now return label won't print. I need this seller to contact me ASAP. Thanks!,0
"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses. They complained that I had to pay the costs for the return myself, they are about $40. I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter. And then there are the extra costs. Conclusion: Who does not come from the states and on gambling stands then she orders you. No recommendation",0
Cute but they taste awful lol,0
"Such a handy little vacuum! It's compact enough to fit under my side table to stay out of sight until it's time to vacuum. Keeps our floors clean and dust-free! ***UPDATE: After only a few days of working, the vacuum started switching directions for no reason and skipping areas of the floor and not cleaning consistently. Will be returning***",0
"Not too picky about these sorts of things but the vanilla smell was too ""chemically."" Not a pleasing scent at all and the drops came out weird. Had to shake the vial pretty hard to get the drops out. Gave this one about three chances in the diffuser before giving up and throwing the vial in the trash. I ordered vanilla from somewhere else.",0
Base got way too hot. Worried about a fire hazard. My daughter really wanted a lava lamp but I didn’t think it was safe enough to have something that got so hot in her room.,0
"several of the balls did not squeak at all. Overall, poor quality",0
"Not soft, thin, can buy the same thing at Wal-Mart for half the price",0
"It was open and the bandage inside was quite crooked. Skeeved me out. The rest seemed to be sealed, but the whole thing itched like mad all night (I'd put it on prior to going to bed). It turned out I ordered the wrong item, but they aren't that different, so I'm not that impressed with the item I got. They're all big band-Aids, after all.",0
"I had been wanting this wallet for a long time. But the ID windows came stained with ink and the plastic is opaque and not clear and see-through, which sort of defeats the purpose of having ID windows. The rest of the wallet looks great, but I'll have to return it because not being able to use the ID windows makes it not functional",0
"It's such a shame. These brushes are perfect, but the mini one snapped and broke in less than a week. I wasn't even using it roughly just cleaning out the nipple piece on the bottle. They should either better design the mini brush to be stronger or at least give you a replacement head. Very annoying.",0
"The plant shipped relatively quickly but without a heat pack. It shipped on a relatively warm day (45 degrees Fahrenheit) so it wasn't the biggest deal, but still. When I opened the package, the plant was completely wilted and had reddish-brown spots on the undersides of all the leaves. I was able to revive it, but overall I was very disappointed. I would not buy from this retailer again.",0
"I will be returning this item. The bottom bracket does not adjust as per instructions. The charging indicator shows sometimes, but does not charge phone. This is a Galaxy S10 Plus, with a punk case. If the bottom actually adjusted this might have worked. Otherwise I very clever design but not fully thought out.",0
"The zipper is very flimsy and broke off on my second use and return window had closed, so now I'm stuck with this useless pouch.",0
Just get a days worth. Expected more,0
"We ordered these because of 3 main features 1. photoelectric, 2. smoke and CO, 3 battery operated. Upon receipt it doesn't' say photoelectric anywhere. I honest to god just put out a neighbors fire last weekend and it was the early detection of photoelectric that saved his home. The alarm went off at the smoldering stage and he wasn't home but we heard the alarm, we busted in and saved the place with a large fire extinguisher. I will not chance using a detector that is not clearly photoelectric, so we immediately returned it, so not able to comment on effectiveness. Can't take the risk.",0
"Even after cleaning the surface with alcohol, the 3M adhesive they have on the back of these mounts is way too thin and weak. The mount fits right, but again, the adhesive is just way too weak.",0
Good price and fits nicely in small apartment. This was the second table sent to me as it was damaged by deliver driver. I don’t think it was packed very well which made it more vulnerable. The second table was also damaged but in a place less visible. It also stains very easily.,0
A stone is missing from it and only used it for two days .,0
They are the worst gloves,0
"liked that supplier had the product I needed available ,but.... I think my 1 1/2 yr old granddaughter could have done a better job boxing my items up. I ordered 2-packs of 6 motor oil and 2- oil filters. Both oil filters had been knocked around inside the packaging box so bad that both were out of their own boxes and I had to dig debris out of the inside of the filters before installation on the vehicle. I was very reluctant to even use them or just throw them away.",0
"One of my glasses came chipped, I ordered the amount that I did for a reason and now I am short one. Very very annoyed that one was chipped. But the 5 that were okay I really like.",0
Works but has runout giving inconsistent pressure on the wire leading to alternating feed speed. Expect better from Hobart.,0
It's cute but it's a little small,0
"The fit of this shirt was great and flattering, but the material was so weird! It was loose and clingy at the same time, I don't even know how you do that. It came with tons of white marks on front, back and at the seams, either where the product was folded or stretched, it looked dirty. I have no idea if this will come out in the wash so I returned before finding out. Two stars for fit only.",0
"Funky, with poor battery life. When working was fine. Replacing batteries every month is a joke. Don't bother buying this",0
Well I haven't stunned anyone...yet. So I can only rate what I know. I bought this because it was small and I could attach it to my belt. The belt loop strap on the case broke in the first 4 hours I had it. So now the convienence of being able to carry it on my side is lost. Now I'm going to have to invest in a case to carry it in.,0
"Depending on where your outlet is, the camera angle ends up being too low to use these outlet chargers. just a piece of plastic really that hold the camera upright.",0
Could never get the bowl filled to the proper level.,0
"It does not crimp well. I tried different crimping tools, all had the same results.",0
"The price is great, but the length of time it works until the cable starts to short out is not nearly what I had expected. I ordered this August 18th, got it maybe a few days later. Here I am, September 13th, not even a month later, and I'm struggling to keep a charge going. Constantly having to adjust the angle of the cable and hold it completely still.",0
"I have had this hat for 2 weeks now and have worn it a few days (4 or 5 days). It is super comfortable, but really lacks quality. The velcro is already separating on the back strap so I'll need to sew it up.",0
"it didnt hatch by itself and the egg was broken... . the hatchimal didnt respond as the instructions mention it will my daugther love it the first day, like any other plushie but this $60 one didnt work as it suppose to do",0
Nice looking watch but fell apart the first time it was worn.,0
"I don't review all the books I read but I needed to review this one because I am genuinely surprised that it was rated so highly and honestly I am frustrated that I wasted my time reading it . The book is not terrible but it is predictable and boring . The author tried to add a twist to the end but like so many books I've read lately , it merely involves the author adding a different scenario and calling it a twist. But this book , like many other recent books, was not intriguing enough and did not have enough depth to make it an actual twist .",0
"Have not used this product yet but want to warn people that one of the bottles opened while in transit. Handling the very soggy box and polish coated bottles was very annoying, As was losing 1/4 of what I paid for because it spilled out.",0
"Unless you're looking for a diaper fit I'd pass on these. Very thick material, not streamlined and just feels bulky.",0
"This was great while it worked, but just stopped working after a month. Tried new batteries, no joy....sad granddaughter.",0
Picture doesn’t come out very clear. Everyone asks what it is a picture of. Very abstract,0
Much smaller than you think. Would be great if they were a little bigger.,0
Cheap plastic so I sent these back and got a refund. I would not recommend these shoes especially in the summer. Flimsy and cheap material. Seem generic.,0
Seemed more like a 2 ply rather than a 12 ply. Much thinner than other 12 ply brands I've purchased.,0
Sprayed unwanted grasses on a Saturday and 5 days later no grasses are dead,0
"difficult to use, especially on yourself. asked my husband to try to braid my hair with it, but it didn't turn out.",0
"They're cute, but order 2 sizes up! I ordered 1 size up and it was too small for my daughter.",0
"I have ordered these several times but in the last batch seems the cut out is different now, and the mask is so wide and then the nose piece is shorter so it doesn't even cover my nose. Won't be ordering again.",0
This bulb is more of a turquoise color than blue. The neighbors made fun of it. :(,0
"This was a disappointment, it breaks off allll the time while applying so annoying. Will not buy this again.",0
The adhesion isn't as good as I'd like my 14month old learned how to pull it off of our fireplace. Now I have trash.,0
not real good quality,0
It cracked the second day and I didn't even drop it.,0
Leaked after 6 months. Great until then...,0
Very small!! Too short on my 7 year old.,0
So boring I couldn't finish it.,0
"Look, it MIGHT bump you into ketosis but it tastes like rotten mangos and smells like feet. I don't expect my supplements to taste good. I want them to be effective. I never puked while drinking it, but I did have to plug my nose and down it like my life depended on it. It's that bad. The seller says they are addressing the odor problem through a combination of solutions. I would advise future purchasers to make sure this issue has been resolved before purchasing, and keep in mind the taste is going to be rough...but the price is right and it's effective.",0
sound only comes out of one side,0
"Diamonds were insufficient to finish the painting., did not line up right and square diamonds were mixed in with the rounds. Very dissatisfied with this painting",0
Packaging arrived dirty and broken as if the item was already used and returned. Felt very awkward giving as a gift.,0
it worked great till the handle snapped in half and the screw the loosen/ tighten the amount of movement for the handle was broken. super upset:/ this happened the first time i got it out to test it with my canon t5.,0
This brand cracks a lot. Not great quality but I’ll let my kids paint with it and get some better stuff for myself.,0
Very small bar of soap .,0
Phone dropped once with case on and screen shattered.,0
"You can slip these shoes on , but there is very little cushion, kind of walking on your feet",0
2 stars because overall purchase was good. I think the YETI cooler is overpriced and overrated !,0
Shipping was fast but I am kinda disappointed with this product because it didn’t work out for me. The price is cheap but the quality is cheap but you get what you paid for. This product didn’t provide a strong thumb grip. It is still slippery and just didn’t function as it is suppose to be. I wouldn’t recommend this product if you are a serious gamer.,0
"It was pretty when it first came in but soon the design started to chip off and it got dirty so easy. And I keep my phone in my pocket or on my desk all the time, shouldn’t be that easy to get dirty. However my phone was dropped a couple of times with the case and it never shattered.",0
Very small and quite hot,0
"worked good out of box and quit working in three months, around 10000 miles, said year warranty and never did get new one",0
"This product did not arrive as described. Only tried on the top and it is WAY to small, not consistent with measurements shown. I don’t think I was sent the correct item and there’s not option to return for correct item. Disappointed!",0
"Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5’8’’ size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it’s for not showing anything on the front? But it’s stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it’s waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I’m cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it’s wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it’s a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee.",0
How can I give it a review when It never shipped to my house?,0
The water socks protected my feet but the were weird feeling and they seem as if worn too much my toes may push through the fabric.,0
Threw mine away after using it twice.,0
"The comforter was very gray, not at all blue as depicted in the picture. I didn't even take it out of the bag because the color was so different from what I was expecting. Quality looked great - I wish they actually had a blue one!",0
I bought these boxes to move. They look great but they broke in several places just from picking them up -and the handles came off and they are hard to get back in place. I would not recommend for the price.,0
"Pretty thin, weak chair. Not really much good to say about it. It's cheap enough but if you're looking for something super sturdy, keep looking.",0
The packaging inside the mailer was damaged and opened when I received it in the mail. I have no way of knowing if the sticks have been damaged until I open one to use it.,0
"I bought these for crawling insects and after about a month, I'm still seeing crawling insects. Granted some are upside down and kicking and some are dead, but there are still some that are crawling/running around at night. I've had to buy insecticides which I was trying to avoid.",0
"These are cool and my kids love them, but they got holes in the seams right away. Disappointed with that.",0
"while the price was excellent and the tool for holding the bands was very good, the bands themselves flew apart about a min. after you started sanding with them. The first one I thought was a fluke but after 10 or so came apart I was concerned . Without eye protection someone could have a serious accident ,I was hit twice in the face as they flew apart. They are separating at the seam and the band of grit is coming loose from the belt. I don't know if somewhere along the line they got wet,or they are not rated for the speed of a simple dremel band rotary tool. The cheapest single speed tools on the market still go at the 25,000 rpm range ,( which was the speed I was using). If these bands are not rated for at least that speed they are no good for much of anything.",0
Was way bigger than anticipated. Not as pretty as the pic,0
"I ordered 3 different palettes, only this one came broken. Well over half of them were obliterated, and all colors I wanted to use. So be very careful if you order, make sure you open over a surface that can be cleaned....I opened mine over light colored pants while sitting on a light colored blanket, SUPER BAD IDEA. Only reason I’m giving 2 stars is because there are still a couple of colors to use, and they seem to be of good quality!",0
"With a brand like Little Tikes, I am shocked at the quality. The handle bar is very loose and wiggles when you try to push. This makes it challenging to pivot when needing to turn. There is also a defect on the handle where the plastic is super sharp. The size of the seat barely fits my one year old and does not look comfortable. I had the Step2 car for my daughter and am upset I didn’t order the same for my son. The only reason I didn’t was because I liked the idea of the canopy!",0
"I actually burned in it and now it sticks where it burned, disappointed but still use it",0
"Let me first explain why I chose this model over others. I don't like the vent clips - I do not think prolonged exposure to hot or cold direct forced air is good for the phone. Dash mounts (even the magnetic ones) require putting adhesive on your dash - no thank you. Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road. My best bet is in the middle, where it is slightly harder to reach, but at least if I'm using GPS it's easier to view than it is sitting in my cupholder or lap.",0
"Made from foam, but I didn’t expect much for the price",0
"Felt, need I say more? From the picture I thought I was buying a soft, silky flower.",0
The stickers are too small and the quality is not good.,0
Was given for a Christmas present. Didn't last 3 months and stopped working,0
Bought this set because i purchased the pots and pans set which are made in Italy. Unboxed this and stamped largely on the bottom is MADE IN CHINA. Also the enamel and ceramic coating looks like it will chip if you blow on it. Overal look of the set is much cheaper looking than the tramontina cook set i purchased. May send it back but this sure explains the low price tag...,0
"Took too long to ship, and assembly instructions were unclear and a poor photo copy so pictures couldn't be used either. Once assembled, they barely spin, only in high(er) winds. Not at all satisfied.",0
"Difficult to open tools. Tried oiling, didn't help much. Had to use a screwdriver to pry tools open.",0
I bought this for my son’s new bed but am sending it back immediately! It’s very soft and a little plush but has plastic in it so it’s So noisy!!,0
Don't buy. Very loud. And wont show up in my DVR settings. Crap..,0
Didn’t keep my hands warm at work stocking frozen foods,0
Bought this and upon opening seemed cheap. The frame would twist and wasn’t made the best. Was hesitant to let my baby play with it.,0
These are freaking adorable! I hung pictures from them. I had these rated a 5 star when i first got them up until I’ve had them for two days and the lights went out. Changed the batteries & still won’t work. All the clips worked fine & it was cute. But the whole point was to have a suttle light & they stopped working. Return started.,0
Really sad because I love this but when I received it it had a huge bubble down the middle where it had been creased. Saw another review with the same problem but was hoping it was a fluke. Guess not. I’ll be returning it.,0
The mic works great once plugged in with a phantom power supply. The part that you insert the arm into the base came off. Seems like it was only held on by glue. So sadly that seems like poor quality.,0
Is cute but to bulky did like it,0
the book was too expensive. can buy it much cheaper. needed to go Amazon Prime because I was gifting it. check with other recovery sites and find the better price is my suggestion.,0
Should have listened to the reviews. The bill is half the size in length of a regular baseball cap.,0
"one of them died on the first rain, one is still working good.",0
First time ordering from this company. Not packed well at all All 3 caps were broken.,0
I have a 2005 Lexus RX330 and it did not fit right. I had to remove the back of the battery pack for it to fit and I had to sand down the inside where the key goes because it wouldn’t shut. I made it work but I won’t be buying this one again,0
Surprisingly ineffective product in very nice packaging. The reagents aren't anywhere near enough for 40 tests. The plunger for filtering simply doesn't work as described. I actually have a background in laboratory techniques so I was taken aback. I had run my samples through a mesh break them down too. Oh well.,0
"package tore when arrived, case they were in not put together very well had to respect it",0
"I have a Moto Z Force. The audio works great and I can control volume and pause/mute from my headset. But, the charger port does not work on either adapter in the two-pack. Could have bought better. Returned. Most, if not all, of the 5 star ratings are fake. You can tell by seeing what other things they have rated on their profiles. Many of them are the same products rated on the same days. Clearly fake.",0
"I'm not sure why, but the first two times I used these they adhered fine and every other pair has been too slippery to really stay where they belong. I would have rated them higher if they all stayed in place like the first two pairs did. I always have limited expectations for products that are basically glorified moisturizing, so while I wouldn't say these do anything dramatic, they are at least pleasant to use - when they are not slipping.",0
"I loved playing this game, but it wont update on my Kindle. It updates on my phone. Very frustrating!",0
It’s very bad i buy one it’s not working,0
It's was nice but had a en hole in it up in the front of it.,0
"Color was not rose gold as per the picture. It is almost write gold. Inside silver is as expected. Size is good. Good condition, good terminations. Disappointed only with the color.",0
Several pieces on this truck broke off within 6 minths.,0
NOT A THERMAL COVER---NOT DUAL LAYER AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE---but it does work for a cover,0
"Two problems, first of all, the mounting holes for the speaker grilles DO NOT line up with the speaker mounting holes into the box. Second problem, how do you mount the crossover network??? There are No holes in the housing to mount it. They should have included a tube of silicone glue with the speakers to glue the grilles to the speaker box and glue the crossover network to the speaker box",0
"Did not receive a black band. Reached out to their customer support, have not heard back.",0
This was the end result after not even 2 weeks. The idea and concept is cute but just didn’t work for me: maybe because the paint on my walls? I’m really not sure but these peeled right off the wall and took my paint with it. Btw it will not hold a swiffer mop,0
The material was cheap and ripped after a few wears and washes - will not purchase again,0
"The board is nice (mine was definitely used since it had scuffs and a cut in the foam mat on top), but the pump is crap! I wanted to exchange the pump (I was ok with the board), but was unable to get in touch with anyone... and did not get a response to my question on exchanging the pump. I kept the board (hassle to send back) and bought an electric pump. Hindsight: there are others on amazon for the same or less with better reviews.",0
"These seemed to only work for a few hours before they either become so saturated that they make no difference, or the adhesive starts to peel off/come loose. I personally have had better luck with sweatproof undershirts.",0
These leggings run small. I would recommend ordering at least 1 size larger than your normal size. They are very well made. An FYI the white legging is transparent.,0
It went on ok but tube dried out fast,0
not what I was looking for these were extremely thin,0
"Three of the lids broke after only a few months of use. Very disappointing, and we will not buy from this manufacturer again.",0
I didn't like it I received the wrong product,0
All meats and seafood stick to this grill. I have to put oil on the grill to prevent sticking. They need to remove 'non-stick' from the description because it's not.,0
I've had the chair for two days and love it but unfortunately I've had to add air to the ball at the end of each day. I'm only 120 pounds and I don't believe I should have to add air that frequently,0
"Might be better for a beginner, new to the industry. Wasn't very informative, or what I was looking for at all. If you have any retail background the information will be reminders at best.",0
"I love the idea of Jack on my socks, the were way too small. I did give them to my daughter, she wares them.",0
"I thought that these stones would look like my original stones, which were partly clear and very pretty. These stones are a solid color, and different size. They do not look like the picture.",0
I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size. Not sure if it’s how it is designed but feels heavy and bulky 2) the class that holds the buckle on slips. I like my belt tight but the teeth just dig in and the “leather” just pulls and stretches.,0
"THis crib is adorable and my 3 year old daughter loves it, but similar to what other people had said, when we put it together the rail split in 3 or 4 places. I don’t really want to go to the trouble of disassembling and returning it, but I’ll be contacting the seller/amazon.",0
There is a recall on this unit due to fire hazard. How do I go about returning this?,0
Works well when it connects. Fails to connect to my iPad about 50% of the time.,0
"When I was putting on the passenger side cover, it ran in two places like nylons. I contacted the seller and they said they would ship another.. so I thought ok. I tries putting on the covers and they did not fit properly, so I packed the merchandise back up. I never did receive the other cover anyways. I went ahead and refunded the product. I lost $15, not including taxes. Very disappointed in this seller. I would never buy from this company again. Live and learn.",0
Not very durable. It’s less than a week after Christmas and the blender is barely holding together.,0
"Very fun game at first but after playing for three or four days, the game crashed and I completely lost all my save data. So all that time went straight out and I lost everything Very disappointing.",0
The large pot is too small,0
The chocolate always arrived like it melted and was in clumps....each time I ordered it.,0
I’ve had these for less than a month and the lid won’t stay closed. Very disappointed.,0
"To hard in the shoes. No arch support, super flat inside the shoe.",0
"Tastes really bad, like chewing on a Quinoa bar. Has the texture of rotten watermelon. The carb content is low which is nice for Atkins dieters, but it's just foul.",0
"These chargers ARE CRUCIAL for the Shibari hand wand massagers, BUT VERY CHEAPLY MADE AND QUICKLY BREAK DOWN AT THE JACK AND GET SHORTS OR OUTRIGHT STOP WORKING.",0
I like the fact that it provided decent padding but the downside is it kept slipping out of place. Although it has a drawstring and elastic the straps every time I sat in it it would slide to the side. That could definitely lead to a fall.,0
The price of the item was too much and the quality wasn’t worth it,0
Could not finish it let alone get into it,0
Very small. Will be canceling subscription. I only have 1 cat and he always looks very uncomfortable in it.,0
"Item mute the sound, but it also changed it (not good). Additionally, the seam between the 2 pieces was loose and rattled anytime I played it. -Down 3 stars- This will be a return item. I think it could be better and for the price I gave 2 stars.",0
"Tires unglued and separated from both rear tires on both the inside and outside of rim within 30 minutes . Traction and handling were nice for 2wd rustler. Glue failed , reglue failed , cannot recommend for 3S.",0
"This was supposed to come with a screen protector and did not. It’s also pretty flimsy, so I will be returning this.",0
Good value but difficult to use..tape gets stuck and hard to cut,0
"Money refunded , only r",0
"Very nice suspenders but mine are defective. One of the clips is missing the nylon teeth insert and does not hold onto pants. This makes them useless. However, if they were not defective, they would have been great suspenders. I will try my luck again likely.",0
"The product was so hot when I took it out of the box, we were in the midst of a heatwave, and I'm sure it damaged the vitamins. No luck with them so far.",0
"They’re comfortable to stand on but they don’t seem to fit right in any boot or shoe I have. The sides have weird flares and the sole itself is very thick, taking room from the shoe and squishing my foot.",0
I wore these bras about 2 times each by the 3rd time the underwire came out. I don't recommend buying these bras. They're a waste of money,0
Packaging was not great and one of the knives are bent,0
"Extremely long shipping time from China, I placed the Order, saw how long it was going to take, tried to cancel and it wouldn’t let me. Now that I have it, it’s not the quality as other bits",0
I placed 2 suits in a garment bag and seam on the side split open. Unfortunately it is now too late to send them back.,0
Not a travel bag. Very light material. Maybe inside a suit case but whats the sense in that. Returned it immediately.,0
"The dish rack looks really nice and is spacious, perfect size for a condo sized kitchen. However, we received the product in defective condition. One side of the clear silverware container was broken and therefore the utensil holder could not be used. This pretty much makes the dishrack useless for me, and so I need to get a replacement. I went to Bed Bath and Beyond to buy a new utensil holder for the dish rack.",0
It worked great for a couple of days and then it made a loud popping noise and shut down only works in reverse. I tried to get tech support (chat) but that's a joke after filling out the information the tech person asks me to repeat what I just wrote and he/she want's to know how I'm doing and the english was awful trying to figure out what he/she meant when asking questions. So I decided to return it and by a better one.,0
Works well but not nearly loud enough for a truck.,0
Not anough coverage across the chest. My tits hang out,0
Cut and material are terrible. I would have returned these but my son saw them and wouldn’t let go :-),0
The quality is awful. Don’t recommend.,0
"Weird, it arrived in a plastic bag not the box as pictured",0
Way overpriced. It came half way full with only 10 servings. I bought it because all natural but the taste is gross and I don’t really feel anything different than coffee. I’ve already used it so I’m not sure if I can return it or get my money back now. Disappointed as I was looking forward to a pre workout that wasn’t full of chemicals.,0
Take too long for delivery.,0
Torch seems to be doing fine for a while. Now the butane continues even after I release and it occasionally doesn't come out in torch form. Spits and sputters the butane out and makes more of a dragon type flame.,0
Easy to assemble a looks nice... but very poor quality. The rod disconnected from the base and fell over after only a few weeks of use.,0
Jan 28 2021 expiration date on new cannister. This cannister does not have same fruity flavor as the expired cannister of teas I finally used up. First cannister I purchased had purple lid. Same tea flavor. Very disappointing. I wont purchase again .,0
"Fortunately, I won’t have to read anymore. Really a slog with 2D characters and predictable situations.",0
"I should have gotten a stronger coffee to mild for me, maybe next time",0
"Great seat however mine came with 2 different nuts to connect the seat to the bowl, one of which was HUGE and didn’t fit the bolt at all. Super upset! I had already pulled apart the old seat and started installing this one when I realized it so now I’m hoping none of my 3 kids break it or fall off before I can properly secure it.",0
The case was great and does exactly what it's supposed to do until the plastic holding the tablet started to disintegrate. I've had this cover since November and in December the corners started breaking. I showed it to my husband just to make sure I wasn't seeing things. As he was holding it plastic from one corner fell off into his hand. I now have 3 corners that are coming apart. Bought two more of these cases and both have the plastic corners cracking and crumbling off.,0
"This should not be sold as a fitness tracker. I have had it on 36 hrs now and it says I haven't slept at all, the steps are very in accurate and the camera button does not work. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because so far the time has stayed correct and if I have bluetooth on it lets me know calls and texts but dont try to read texts because they only fash across the screen once and there is not a way to look at them again. Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies. Nice job on making a slim design watch that actually fits my small wrists.",0
I hope that the seller sends me a new and clean book because the center page is crinkled up really badly. So badly you cant really read the page. I know it is only technically 2 pages the front and back of pages 219 and 220. Please send me the unwrinkled version as this was suppose to be a gift for someone.,0
"I bought this to help with the glide of my gaming mice. The tape is good for a few days but then begins to peel and causes friction between the mouse and mouse pad, causing me to then remove the tape and reapply. Would not recommend.",0
For some reason the sound keeps cutting out on the DVD..it's getting really frustrating and I don't think it's caused by my computer. Wanted to know if others were having this problem as well.,0
"This runs small,order a size up and it is “ok “,but not comfortable-Plus it has those tiny little snaps and takes a few minutes to get them attached-I wear it because it does work well for me , but I don’t love it-It’s stiff and uncomfortable just dosent have the flexibility I like-I’m sure it would be hot in summer I-Spanx is much more comfortable for every day even though it’s more expensive-",0
I got this bottle for drinking my essential oils. Must use a glass or stainless steel container. There is a small plastic ring in the lid that can not withstand the oils. So now that ring is gone and the lid won’t seal.,0
Love the drink itself however only received 21 of 24 cans and they were all dented and hard to open-also just thrown in an open box and sticky. Other 2 orders were not like this though.,0
"I have used quite a few different lash growth serums, some more expensive than others, and this one is not great-- especially for the price. If you want real results you are better off paying for the R+F lash serum because that will actually work.",0
I’m having a hard time getting in to it. Tried to return but it cost to return.,0
"It felt like reading a college text book. Way to much detail, he could have simplified things. He’s all over the place, not a consistently written book. I like Tom Friedman but this book was a waste of time. Not worth reading.",0
"I'm glad this pack came with two screens because the first one cracked when all I did was put it on. The second screen I got on. I liked that the corners/ edges are covered which is why I bought this one. However, there is a noticeable lack in response from the touch screen with this cover.",0
Regular legos are not compatible with this table!!!! I would not have bought it if I knew that :(,0
"I wanted to like this movie because of the important and meaningful context of child abduction, but I couldn't watch the whole thing, I had to start skipping parts due to the main character not being likable, lots of flash editing transitions that you can do in imovie, and just drawn out redundant scenes. If you want to watch an unforgettable similar movie, try ""Dearest"" - best child abduction and Chinese movie I've seen..",0
"Material is too thin, cheap and itchy. I bought a pair of leggings from Costco and the material was thicker than this jeggings. Definitely going back, too bad was so excited about it.",0
Haven't used long dog seems to drink more while taking.,0
Clock has nice features but short in circuitry after 8 months makes it unusable.,0
The icons came scratched up on several places. I don't have the time to send it back and wait for another one. They're noticeable when the lights are off. It looks so pretty on my desk when it's on . If it were in new condition I would rate it 5 stars. It's almost as if it were used. The scratches look more noticeable in person than in pictures. Don't get me wrong it looks really nice. I'm just disappointed it arrived like this.,0
The screen protector was ok until I dropped my phone two days ago. I used this product along with a Mophie case. My phone cracked in the corner and the screen protector did not stop my actual phone screen from cracking. The screen protector also cracked when the phone dropped. Note: My phone only was dropped about three feet.,0
The materiel of the bra is very rough.,0
Phone arrived beyond dead and took forever to turn on. Appears to function fine. Came with a case and screen protector which masked the issues. The phone is in TERRIBLE shape. It looks like someone threw it in a box of gravel and shook it for an hour. I have never seen a phone with so many scratches and flaws to the body. I’m scared to take the screen protector off because of what I’ll find under there. This is not a full refurbish. This is a factory reset and maybe a quick function test.,0
"today i had a stubborn can., i pulled out the p38 and what an epic failure. my old one that actually came from the military is far better. very disappointing..........",0
"Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder.",0
My fault for not looking at the dimensions before purchasing. It's SO small.,0
"I just got these pens... literally out of the box and 3/4 of them aren't completely filled with ink. One of the blue ones (see photo) has so little ink that it looks completely empty. This was not a cheap set compared to others available, but the colors looked nice and I thought I'd give them a try. At almost $30, I should have just stuck to the cheaper sets. At least it wouldn't have cost me as much to replace them when they ran out of ink.",0
"These nesting dolls are very pretty. Very nice work and that is why I'm giving them 2 stars. However, the second doll seems to have been shellacked shut. It is impossible to open. Even my husband tried prying them. It is impossible. I think it is ridiculous that the purpose of this toy is to be able to be opened (by a child) and they cannot even be opened by a grown man. I bought them even though I saw that in someone else's review, and I wish I didn't because they cannot be returned. So, now I'm stuck with a set of nesting dolls and I can only open the first one. Totally disappointing. **Update: Amazon came through for me and made it right and I really did appreciate that. Thank you, Amazon.",0
Band is way too short! My sister lost it within a week since it kept falling off. So disappointed.,0
"I have super thick, coarse, and curly hair - this moisturizer has too much protein in it, or something. My hair became super tangled - I had to shampoo my hair several days in a row (I normally only shampoo once a week). Can’t use this product.",0
Don't like the whole silk nylon feel of this item way too hot for summer and uncomfortable for something that's supposed to clean to you again very small not for thicker women if you have a flat stomach you maybe to pull this off Constable however it is a hot material so I would recommend wearing it at night when you're going out or something is not something that you would think of cloth that you can wear during a summer day and just don't some cute flip flops it's very hot very tight and weird material,0
"Comforter looks very thin. Does not look like a full even though it was advertised as one! It has not been washed or used yet since it is a gift. Hopefully the stitching & color hold up. I am worried about the quality of this product just from looking at it. I really hope it can handle being used on a child's bed, since that it what it was intended for.... frequent wear & tear and frequent washing.... we'll see..... The price was a little high for such a thin ""comforter"", claiming to be for a full size bed. This barely covers a full!",0
Well since I'm sitting here watching Christmas programs this morning I might as well give this product review do not buy I repeat do not buy the first three days one of them fell apart on the 7th Day the second one fell apart I'm sorry for the bad review but I call them as I see them I will not buy any of these again for those of you just reading this I strongly suggest that you get the one that is the screw-in not the bayonet it totally sucks,0
This book arrived bent out of shape and with a some type of stain on it.,0
I was sooo excited to order these for my children. I also ordered a set for myself. After using one I found it was hard to slide the closer but chalked it up to the fact it was new. My husband used it and cracked the slide the first time he tried to open it. It is also very hard to keep open when you are trying to pour into it. Great idea but it needs some more work on the quality of the slide and shape of the bag.,0
"This book was helpful for my review; however, I failed on the test. There were tons of practice questions for each chapter, but they are very easy to the point that you don’t really need to buy this book. When I took the TEAS, the questions on the actual TEAS were very different. Some reviewers said that the question on the book were similar on the actual TEAS, but they were wrong. I studied the cardiovascular system intensively, and there is no one single question about the heart at all. The English portion on this book is very different on the actual TEAS. In the book, it focuses on grammar and spelling. On the actual TEAS, it is more on ‘if the sentence is written correctly?’ Overall, I don’t think that this book is worth buying. Like I said, the questions on the book are very easy. They are more on common sense. Compare to the actual TEAS exam, you will have to think and reread the question again.",0
The suction cups suck. They don’t work. Net part is fine with suction cups I bought separate,0
How can this be bed bug proof If it doesn't completely close the mattress in. I was disappointed that the mattress cover didn't completely closed the mattress inside it just went on top that's no protection at all.,0
"The dilators are almost perfect, but the numbers on the sides are just bothersome enough to prevent going past their location near the midpoint.",0
"They seem to feel okay, well constructed. After wearing for a few hours they slip down my feet and don't do anything for the arch support. I would not recommend these if you have small feet like mine. I wear a size 6.",0
Great material and condition but the medical tag part keeps opening and I lost all my contact information that was in there the very first day. The clip alone is not very strong.,0
"I asked the seller if the color was too yellow before buying and was told it's like antique gold, darker. Nothing close! The set looks VERY cheap. It's super shiny yellow with lots of CZs, even shinier. Looks great on the photo, but in real life I wouldn't even give it to a teenager to wear.",0
"This is so weird. In normal light it looks like I have a pink and an orange but under UV light they are the same! No pink! I drew a pink line using a paint stick from another brand so you can see what pink should look like and know it's not just my camera. Pink is my most used color so I'm a bit upset about this. Red, orange, and pink are basically all orange. No point in calling them red or pink. The white isn't as bright as I would have hoped. The rest of the colors are all great and I like how easily these paints wash off. I just wits there were a pink. I guess the purple will suffice.",0
they work horribly to hold hats the pegs are not long enough . Do not use for hats if you regularly use hats .,0
"Stickiness is perfect, but not comfortable wearing it. Eyes felt a bit pricking. Unlike my other eyelid tapes, don’t feeling anything on eyes.",0
I like this product but it’s definitely made cheaply and the cash register can be a pain to open sometimes.,0
From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren’t smart in knowing what direction you’re trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.,0
"There's an education problem in America, yes, but no shortage of STEM educated. I find this a red herring, and, more importantly, does not offer solutions since it's barking up the wrong tree. The fact that this author is anonymous speaks to the issue: the all too powerful industry, who're after US' elite entitlement: indentured labor.",0
These shed too much.,0
Looks good. It's not completely level. Only 3 wheels touch the ground out of 4 at anytime.,0
Its a shame cause I love the style and color of this bag but the lining is so cheap and ripped after very little use.,0
"Insert for between was hard to put in place. Once in, it was lumpy. May fall into place after use, but not as expected.",0
Stays on good but sharpening it is painful as it just breaks apart so you lose most of pencil. Bought 2 times not again,0
"Great packaging and a nice piece of glass. Was happy until the edge of the glass starting coming apart after 3 weeks. No drops, no impacts with my new iPhone X, the glass literally just chipped off where I pull up from the bottom of the screen to go “home”. Looks like the glass is just poorly laminated or whatever would cause this.",0
This thing never worked for me. I tried it multiple times with same results. The way it removes the hair is not efficient. You have to use a lot of cream and it wouldn't remove the hair as close as a trimmer and still grows back just as thick.,0
Packaging was terrible. Liquid container just thrown in box that bounced around in transit with no protection. Would not purchase again.,0
This literally fell off a little over a month after I got it,0
Monitor size was great I liked the picture quality but image was stuck in split view with only one camera purchased,0
Really disappointed. So small for the price!,0
The case has great protection however it turns yellow after a few months of use.,0
"The shoes are decent, mine came damaged as well as the packaging being damaged but I need should now and can't replace them. I'd recommend a different brand honestly.",0
"Pay very close attention to the size. It’s huge and shockingly HEAVY. Will easily scratch countertops if not extremely careful. Mine came without the pestle, so had to return, even though I was excited to use it.",0
I am a size 10 and I ordered a L. It is huge and boxy on me. The sleeves are even too long ( I am 5'7 so its not that I have short arms). Maybe a small would have fit better. I would return it but I didn't try it on when I got it and now it is too late.,0
The LED high beams aren't very high beam... they aren't even that bright the low beams are bright and look out farther than the leds!!,0
Lasted only a day! They are cool and my kids love them but get sad that they come off or look like poop the next day.,0
Ordered this for my son. We waited for 3weeks to arrive. The left side where the whole for the garter is torn so we had to tape it. The black paint was erased after a week. This mask is really thin.,0
"Worked nicely for 2 weeks but now it doesn't always charge. When it did charge, it was as fast as using a normal USB cable but usually 20-30 minutes slower than a fast charge cable directly plugged into the phone. I like the upright design of it but I recommend investing more money in a higher quality product.",0
"I did not like this. First mistake was not really reading the details or description. Second mistake was purchasing it. The brush is way too small, even for me being a beginner.",0
"Poor design in utilizing the phones features, and no amount back and forth with vendor will change that. It cheap for a reason... You invested a fair amount in the phone, so do the same for the case.",0
Require too much assembly and received broken parts due to poor packaging.,0
Not as expected. Heavy but not what I wanted. Thought it was for back seat. My fault for not studying the ad further,0
Please revise the app... need this smart bulb to turn on a couple of hours before dusk and to go off an hour after dawn... also add.the ability to cause the bulb to flash to help first responders find my house in the event of an emergency,0
Not impressed... Does not work,0
"This case looks nice and gives the phone a bit of grip, which makes it less likely to slip off from slick surfaces, but it ripped within a couple weeks of having it on my phone.",0
"A lot of our perceptions of how something works for you, is how you feel after using it. I waited about a month after finishing a bottle and before writing a review. I went Keto at the time of starting this product. I took it once a day at different times throughout the day to see if it mattered how I felt. I can’t say I felt differently, unlike the feeling I got with brain octane or unfair advantage. Sometimes these things take a while to kick in or it can be a cumulative benefit. Therefore, I can neither confirm or deny it’s advantages.",0
Not impressed... pain in ass putting cuffs back in.,0
"It would not hold up my iphone 8 plus, even though it said it supports an 8 plus. Once on the vent and my iphone is placed in the holder, it bends forward because it is not strong enough to hold my phone up to see.",0
Love it Changed my mind... now I have two broken bracelets . Waiting for someone to contact me... please!!!,0
Too thin but will do in a crunch.,0
"Doesn't hold enough. Maybe for a guy, but it would have taken up too much room in suitcase and didn't hold everything like my current one.",0
"I love to plant and grow trees, but this one is very low in germ. It been almost a month and I see nothing grow. I live in zone 5 and follow what they say but see nothing so far. Will change review if something happen.",0
This is just ok! Makes a buzzing noise while plugged in. My 12.00 toaster was just as good. Nothing special about this one,0
"Flashlight is lightweight and relatively flimsy. Bought for occasional use around the house and emergency use in case of power outage since I already have two 19.2 batteries for my drills. Have only used one of the lights a few times and the bulb burnt out, maybe had 30 minutes total use. I didn't drop the light or abuse it so was pretty surprised by the short life of the bulb. Went on Amazon to buy replacement bulbs and found the reviews to be poor and that these bulbs routinely burn out quickly. Certainly wouldn't buy Craftsman bulbs - very expensive. Will buy an off-brand bulb at $1 a bulb or an LED replacement if it has good reviews.",0
Bought for college age child...says it doesn’t cook evenly. Outside gets burnt while inside still uncooked. Very disappointed. Would return if possible.,0
"Installed ok, and everything opened as should have, but was not able to use as Windows tried to tag it as official Office, and therefore couldnt open to use it. Might have just been an issue on my end, But didnt work.",0
I was very excited to use these but found very quickly that they were crap! The salt got stuck under the cover and every time you turn the cover to adjust what size holes you are using the salt poured out and even when all the holes were closed it did the same. The salt also got stuck in the cap so when you opened to refill the excess salt got all over. I threw them out. I guess you get what you paid for.,0
Isn't a child small size,0
"What a disappointment. If you have a Note 8, and you use any type of protective plastic on it, you may not be able to close the holster with the zipper. It will definitely not close with an Otterbox case. A smaller case may allow you to close, but it if it does, it will be a very tight fit. I'll see if I have another use for this holster. If not, I'll return it, and if I do return it, I expect the shipping costs to be covered by Amazon.",0
"We bought this as a replacement for another kids instrument set, which we really liked. While it looked similar, it certainly didn't sound like the old ones. We will be returning and trying again to get the ""original"" :(",0
Nothing spectacular about this product. The color is more lighter than I expected. Feels likes a regular t-shirt.,0
Water bottle doesn’t fit them. I sent them back,0
Wasn't really happy with this the person on the other end said you hear more backround noise they they could hear me,0
"I can't say much about the hose itself, but the connector hardware is of very thin construction and will not last long. If you will connect the hose only once, you are probably OK. But it you will connect and disconnect from time to time, the connectors (both ends), made of thin sheet metal instead of cast, will fail you in no time. Will not recommend. Will recommend Amazon to take it out of its ""Choice"" list - not a high quality product.",0
Did not fix squeaky floor,0
Yes if you drill into the entire add they are the small size that they say they are. However I was only searching in standard size bed pillows which every ad before it and after it we're the same even though they were more money. This was totally not what I was looking for and it's also my fault for not double-checking. Now I have four really nice new standard size pillow cases and these little tiny pillows...,0
I like how the case looks I really do but it is already coming apart I have had it for 1 day and it is making my Face ID not work. The looks of the case can not get it more then 2 stars.,0
"I thought the picture was great, until I noticed the banding issue getting worse. Then I realized 4K sometimes looks worse because of this. Then there is the audio. No matter what devise I plug into, there is an audible static whenever sound is being played. It reminds me of those old sound clips for AOL Instant Messenger. Will be returning this. Was a shame, I waited minths for this to TV to come out.",0
I'm only on page 44 and continue to find inaccuracies. The calculation to find your BMR uses the wrong mathematical symbol and unit. Also the calculation for needed carbs per day is wrong. It should use body weight in kg -not pounds. I certainly should not be carb loading with 900 grams of carbs!,0
Well I had ordered two of them when I them one would not work when took out of printer the chip tape had fell off and did not work.As far as other one works just fine for now hope it last.....,0
"I bought two of them in April and both felt good when I tested at home, but one one of them is slowly deflating over 30min period 😓, just couldn't sleep over the weekend. However other one is good. Since it's 2mo I bought it I can't return it 🤦‍♂️ Advice: test at home for long time, sit on it for a bit.",0
Packaging was not good and one glass was broken when we opened it. My wife cut her hand on broken glass that was in another cup. Not like this brand used to be.,0
"Pros: Good size, almost covers the top of our queen mattress Cons: Not as soft as it looks. Very heavy, but not because the pile of the fur is so lush, but because it's 2 pieces of fabric sewn together, and the backing is heavy, like faux leather. The fur is short, and has a rubber feel to it. My 12 year old daughter said it made her skin feel itchy.",0
"these were too small but my biggest problem is how low rise they are, and have very little give in them",0
I like the built in flashlight - it does the job. I like the standard batteries and that they are relatively easy to change.,1
It serves its purpose. Love it,1
They work great easy to use,1
"Look great, good quality. Needed to cut a notch in the drivers side front support bracket to get it to fit properly.",1
"The product is great, I have been using it for the last 45 years. The web page to purchase it was very easy to use which facilitated the purchase and the price was excellent.",1
I like this fabric. It's very soft and comfortable. It came out of the bag with a strong musty smell. It was fine after washing. Love the throw pillows. Wish the shams were reversible like the rest of the set. They could have easily put the opening on the end so both designs could be used. All in all very happy with this as a warmer weather bedset.,1
"Dress fits perfectly. Item is as described. Disappointed there are no care instructions. The dress is extremely wrinkled and I now have to pay to have it professionally cleaned and pressed to remove the wrinkles... all that aside, it is a beautiful dress.",1
"I put this pair of flamingos on my shower doors. The legs are a little tricky, but you just need to slow down and take your time. I am very happy that this decal is repositionable.",1
Gift for my grandson. Good book. Very cute. LOTS of dialogue!!,1
they do seem to keep the bugs off the outside light but they are not very bright,1
"for the price and what it is for I can't complain, you can also wear it on the wrist",1
These are very comfortable and I like the variety of colors as I wear many different colored pants.,1
"2006 Honda Accord sedan. Had a difficult time trying to install unit. Fully assembled, the unit was not fitting into the small space. The arms were hitting and I could not get it to go in. Not sure if this is the way to go, but I disconnected the rod from the motor gear so I could ""flatten"" out the linkage. Once I did this the unit slid into place very easily. The only hard part was reconnecting the arm to the motor gear. You have just enough room to fit your fingers in behind the linkage. Then you have to press, HARD, to get it to ""snap"" into place on the ball. Other than that issue, everything seemed to go smoothly.",1
The jasmine smells amazing. The Rose smells cheap. Overall decent quality,1
Clear and detailed. The author brings the facts and the actions without any judge or reasoning behind. It is truly a policy report style,1
Covers your lady bits well however its more of a one to two time use kind of thing,1
"I am a Ballistic fan, however, not finding many cases to choose from. The iphone 8 plus does fit but barely. The corners fit well and has good padding - not enough padding/lip on rest especially top & bottom.",1
"Like any good Biblical fiction, this makes me want to re read the Biblical account. Thank you for the hours of research this novel shows.",1
It puts a lot of pressure causing pain. Put a folded hand towel on it for padding,1
Works and fits great...keeps dog hair off the seats,1
Great jacket for a great price. I honestly cannot complain. It keeps me warm though sometimes leaves feathers behind. Overall a great buy! Will buy in another color,1
Works great. Does not irritate my gums.,1
"They were very comfortable but my toes touched the top on the right shoe and since my left foot is a little smaller, it slipped quite a lot, just too big.",1
"I have owned 4 pairs of these boots and I have been satisfied with all but one pair. Those seemed to have poor quality not sure why. As for the other 3 pairs they have been through a beating and lasted for up to 3 years each. They wear great and are tough. I have used them for work, hunting, and hiking. Great boot for the price.",1
I used this product to cover the drawers of an old dresser. Now it looks very chic and expensive. I would definitely recommend this product to others. I used a felt covered applicator (just search Amazon for wallpaper kit) and I didn't encounter any bubbles with the product. Very easy to use if you have the right tools.,1
Easier to handle over standard style walkers although not as stable and secure. Hard to find the replacement guides for the bottom. Folds nicely and is very light weight.,1
Love the series. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the whole series is not available on Kindle. 😥,1
"Just right for us, towels, first aid kit, tools, personal emergency toiletries, our pizza 🍕 bag, folded up cooler bag and extra tissue box. BUT HAD WE NOT FOUND THE PERFECT BUNGEE CORD TO SECURE IT, IT WOULD SLIDE ALL OVER. 4 stars for not having a rubbery base so it wouldn’t slide at every stop and turn. Note: our success was in part to measuring every thing that we wanted to put in it and where it would go before ordering!",1
"Bought this for my children to play with, all under the age of five. It has held up remarkable well despite repeated use and is aesthetically pleasing to boot. The only difficulty, putting this bad boy together. Plan to put some time aside to follow the picture book instructions that appear to have been drawn by graphically challenged individuals with cataracts. Also, to increase the sturdiness of the wood pegs (used to hold certain pieces together) I used wood glue. All in all, good little set up. Would definitely recommend.",1
I liked it. It just jammed a few times about 20-25 staples on and off. but it got the job done. ups not a bad price,1
good price. I always have a spare set around,1
"Chair came fast. Already put together and ready to go. Instructions are old for xbox 360, Wii and PS3. So those need an update. You're going to be sitting straight up in this chair. No reclining back. Could use more padding on the seat.",1
Attractive. Love the magnetic closing. Loop for Apple Pencil became loose. Now it falls out.,1
Great set for the family,1
I think for the price it's very beautiful. It may or may not turn your wrist green I wouldn't wear it in the shower or anything but it's very very pretty for costume jewelry.,1
This pole is longer than most of other poles on the market.,1
These are my favorite crayons for my kiddos. Son used them as a toddler and now my daughter. They last a long time and color well.,1
"This is a great gift for any kid that is a plane enthusiast. It was really easy to put together, but one down fall is that the tail piece doesn't seem to snap in very well, so it can be pulled off rather easy. The other wings seems to snap in tight and there are no issues with those. The lights are really bright, and the speaker is loud enough, but not too loud. It doesn't seem to work on carpet very well, but works great on wood floors or outside in the driveway. Over all great gift, it would be a 5 star if the tail piece didn't off so easily.",1
I didn’t use it but the green I was expecting from the picture is a normal hunter green and what I received is a very light color green. Just doesn’t do it for me so returning. Have been using the hatchbox stuff and it’s great but I love amazon so gonna give it a go with the dark blue,1
Exactly what I was looking for. Quick delivery.,1
Seem good - I like this style of earbud - we'll see how they stand the test of time.,1
Containers hold up well and generous in size. Best thing is that it is much lighter than pots and takes up minimal storage space.,1
"Exactly what I was looking for. Nice height adjustable easel. That said the directions were in Chinese, but I was able to follow the pictures. Please look at the picture I had to clamp the bottom tray just touching it will cause it to fold. The clamp solved the problem but any child using this can collapse it easily.",1
"It's kind of hard to review medicine since I'm swallowing it, not tasting it, and it doesn't have any physical effect on me. Package arrived quickly, bottle was easy enough to open, and soft gels seem to be the appropriate count (I'm certainly not counting). They don't stick together or leave a weird color on the bottle or anything else that someone might complain about.",1
Great straps for short sets. They do slip but if you like to space out your sets then you have plenty of time to adjust them,1
"Didn’t last long, but manufacturer replaced it.",1
"Works okay, it doesn't work exceptionally well, but I don't have anything bad to say either!",1
"What a great game. Easy to learn and can be a blast. This unit is made kinda cheaply. It's wood, just extremely light. The tiles get knocked down very easily.",1
Classic movie featuring Bette Midler. I saw this movie years ago and was great to revisit this on DVD. Fun to share with people who haven't seen this movie.,1
I enjoyed this book. The story was well-written and the characters were so life-like. I definitely recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.,1
"It Cuts extremely well. I'll give it a 5. The blade turned on the edge brownish, but I worked on it & it's okay still cuts. Good for the money for simple cuts. My observation. Adult supervision extremely advised.",1
This will be great book for sous vide food lover. This book providing some awesome sous vide recipes . Those recipes are so tasty and healthy. Enjoying those recipes. Loving stuff.,1
"I gave this cooler a test run at home, prior to my upcoming trip. I put in 4 bottles of water and filled the cooler half full of ice. I checked it every 4 hours. The ice was completely melted after 12 hours, however the water stayed cold for 24 hours. Best of all, the cooler did not leak! With the benefit of folding flat this will be great to put in a suitcase and use on my next Las Vegas trip. Hotels in Vegas rarely have in room refrigerators, so this cooler will work perfect without leaving a puddle of water.",1
I used this product in combination with my diet/ exercise to help lean down. Both products were a great addition and I could tell I dropped much needed water weight .,1
Love this protector but the color has turned yellow. Still very durable. The color doesn’t effect the use of this.,1
"Expensive, but won't oxidize metal. Maybe better than soap",1
"Great easy device for tracking my miles and workout times when my bike is on the trainer. The instruction manual that comes with it is useless, so I had to search online but it wasn't hard to figure out by looking at all the parts that come with it.",1
Seem to work. Just as cheap as the originals that came on the Cargo trailer. Remember the weird looking screw head is likely just a square drive and not a torx or allen. UPDATE: BOTH broken in less than a Year. Both the rod and the piece that goes on the trailer have broken. So I just went to the local RV place and got metal parts. If you don't have any wind or Employees that don't pay attention you may be o.k.,1
Good for a temporary fix if you have company and need something that you can pull out of a closet or from under your bed. I would get a protective covering when storing besides the one on it because it is white and can get stained very easy. I wouldn’t use long term but for a couple of nights it works when my son comes and spends the weekends.,1
"I originally ordered the 3x top, but it was a little too big in the bust. Sized down to the 2x and it's almost perfect. A little bit of rolling up, but other than that, super cute top.",1
I got this for Yeti mug as reminder of how much I loved my nursing career. I thought I applied according to directions but the bottom part of the heart peeled up after a few washes. (not in dishwasher) I eventually just removed the whole stethescope. I did enjoy the pattern and color choices of the creation.,1
"It's really a toy, not binoculars. The magnification and construction are good, but the field of view is TINY. You have to really get the width adjustment right or you won't see much. A little frustrating for my 4 year old, but good enough for older kids who can adjust themselves.",1
"Pros: Easy assembly, about 20mins with 2 people. Directions good. Looks nice and very sturdy when all assembled. Cons: Some small scratches on metal frame. Some discoloration on wooden slates but easily hidden with a furniture marker. A couple of minor warped slates.",1
"It did an o.k. job, not that impressed.",1
"Although the packing was suspect, pieces were out of the plastic bag, they were all there. I am looking forward to being able to use it. I am still trying to return the original shipment.",1
"Opened box and sadly disappointed as unit is Plastic and not steel! Unless I missed something, I didn't see any mention in description of material. I assumed it was steel and we all no what happens when you assume!!",1
"On the S8, the side edges of the case don't completely cover the raised/curved glass of the phone, but other than that, nice looking / great texture.",1
Super warm and stylish hat but runs large on me. Well made and washed well without fading or losing its shape.,1
Worked like it said it would,1
A little basic and could use more variety but my son loved them!,1
Ordered to use with western themed tree! Blends with the theme well.,1
"when you run out of power, you need to re-adjust the time.",1
"This novel is reminiscent of the old Victorian style romances, with some unsettling twists and a great tale of self discovery.",1
"Really good book, but there is some minor editing issues and I'm not sure if it is because I read with black background and white text. But the text going from gray to white to sometimes blue kinda throws me off. Still a good book and can't wait for the next one",1
"Not quite the right length, but looks good",1
So overall I like this flag. The colors are bright and the material feels good for the price. Not cheap but I definitely wouldn't keep this outside in bad weather. The one bad this about this is my flag smelled awful when it came out of the package. I bought another flag with this one and they both have this weird chemical smell. It's give me a headache and they haven't even been up 30 minutes. I sprayed them down with odor neutralizer and it helped for a few minutes. Definitely try to air out your flags before you put them in a room or anything,1
This smart bulb works great and functions exactly as advertised. It has wide range of colors that you can pick from. Having a light tint color help me concentrate when I'm reading or studying.,1
"Well made product. Now, only time and use will tell.",1
I bought this protein every month but cookies flavor is bad,1
"Pretty nice, the app interface could use some updating. Looks good behind my 55' tv.",1
Great for so many of my recipes. It holds together nicely. Its a bit thinner than i thought.,1
this is well made except that ours came like it was used. I don’t if it’s paint or what but it was all over the set for the hand. see photos. it is still well made and i’m probably just going to ask the seller to replace the ones that has paint on it cz my son absolutely loves it and doesn’t want me to send back. it functions as it should but it just looks used to me. can’t imagine how paint would end up on the items except with use.,1
Little big but works good,1
"These did help with curls, but I needed a second package due to my extra long and think hair. I was surprised at how comfortable they were during sleep.",1
"Insane ending. A little too insane, but I will say I didn't see it coming.",1
"So for the cost its a good value.. it came in plastic, of course, and it smelled so bad i had to spray with febreeze. like dousing in febreeze and leave it outside. it smells like chemicals you would use to burn something with. pretty gross. I know my little guy is going to ride in this.. but not for hours and hours.. so i will put a blanket and such in there to make him comfortable.",1
Like it but the topper doesnt stay put easily,1
"Excellent quality shirts in my opinion but absolutely they run large. I will toast mine in the hot water washer and dry on high to see if they'll shrink down, and report back. The sleeves of the t-shirt are longer than the sleeves on my short-sleeve button down shirt.",1
Very easy to install. Took me no more than 30 minutes total. They look amazing! The only reason why I gave them 4 stars is the fact that I noticed a little bit of flex in the steps when I use them. I'm 230 pounds so I wouldn't recommend them for anyone significantly heavier than that. This is for my wife's lifted Jeep so it is more than enough for her. The stars on the step plates are a perfect touch.,1
"Works well for a motorcycle helmet lock, just a little short",1
The paper quality is good - just using it by itself with styluses provided. The bonus stencils are there just to get your attention as it absolutely useless with provided styluses. Overall positive experience,1
"This book was a great read. Fun and hot! The romance between the two main characters was sweet. The authors hit all the feels. However, the tension was a bit lacking. They tried but it just didn't work for me. Will read more from the authors.",1
its good but small tube,1
My toddler grandsons seem to like them the only thing I wish it would have included in this set is like larger solid pieces that you could use for a base etc.,1
"Crayola 12 count colored pencils hold up well to the pressure on the paper. The tip does not break easily and the colors are very vivid as expected with this brand. The downside is that the pencils are the standard size and not really great for young elementary and preschool age. A smaller (length pencil) would have been better. I don't feel like sharpening the pencil all the way down for each one, so it works well enough for now. This brand consistently makes good coloring items and this is no exception. I just think I would have spent a little more time researching the length of the pencil in the future. I was also surprised to find a two pack of colored pencils about the same price with prime as the one pack from a different seller.",1
I purchased these as a gift for my mother. She LOVED them! Solved her problem with the earrings she loves to wear and they were Incredibly comfortable. You couldn’t see them either when she wore them.,1
I use this to keep my cream fresh. It works and keeps the cream fresh for about 4-5 hours.,1
Exactly as advertised.,1
So after playing with this watch all day I have to say not bad. Not great but not bad. I don’t like the fact that you have to remove the wrist band to charge the watch. Also that when lift to see the time doesn’t always work. When you use the watch to take a picture with your phone it doesn’t show you what the camera sees. It locates your phone with sound but if you use your phone to find your watch the watch vibrates which is useless. The other functions are ok but are a little glitchy. In the end It’s a nice cheap alternative for a child who wants smart watch.,1
"Bought these to use on the beach. They're nice for drinks and help keep them studier. However, they don't work for snacks because they're so low to the ground that there's no way that sand doesn't get kicked into them. I think they'd be useful for drinks for almost any outdoor venue to give a little extra spill protection, although they'll only work on a fairly flat surface. The plastic is quite thick and hard, so they seem very durable.",1
"It keeps things cold very well. My issue is with the top, it gets dirty between the two layers of the slide drinking slide and there is no way to clean it. I’m looking for a leakproof top that You can wash. Mine looks pretty mildewed after 6 weeks. Cloudy and trapped dirt is in there",1
As advertised. Product performed as described. Well built. Recommended,1
The pans are great but they do not nest inside each other. I wish I had noticed the reviews that mentioned that before purchasing these.,1
"quality is so so. The only thing I like is BPA free. For 36 pk, it's still a good deal.",1
Liked the positive attitude.,1
"I enjoyed that Alabama Moon was a ""clean"" movie that the family can watch. It moved along and kept my interest.",1
Very pretty earrings. Kinda big for me personally as a prefer smaller-sized earrings but will probably give a pair to my niece since they're v.stylish.👍,1
works well but hard to peel off,1
"The auger bit is find for my use. I needed to plant blubs around some trees. It was better than trying to dig with a spade. The ground is hard and some top roots. The best way to use, is to angle the bit a little and when drilling only go a small depth and pull the bit out. Do this several times until you get the depth you need.",1
Works for lighter posters. Don't hang anything heavy.,1
"Works great but door could be designed a little better. Really, would it cost that much more to put hinges on it?",1
These cards are lovely! Nice quality paper and the gold foil is beautiful! The envelopes are white while the cards are cream/Ivory so my only wish is that the envelopes better matched the card color.,1
"I needed something to hold my large collection of fashion jewelry that wasn't too obvious but let me see everything I have. I also wanted a full length mirror...and I found this! It was affordable, fit my needs and looks great. I mounted it on the wall but used a sturdier bracket underneath that doesn't show like the dinky brackets included with the cabinet. The mirror is huge, unlike the other cabinets I looked at that had little 10"" mirrors. The quality of mirror is good too, no distortion to speak of. Very happy with this purchase and highly recommend!",1
"I bought this repair kit with intention of repairing my Gamecube controller, and was highly satisfied with the tools that came equipped. The tools not only work on Nintendo controllers, but Xbox as well. I would highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to replace their controller shell, buttons, or even just clean out their controller.",1
My last popsocket was better than this one.. anytime my phone gets slightly warm the adhesive loosens and the darn thing falls off 😑,1
I still need to adjust a bit to get NBC but I get all other channels very clearly. I'm very happy with this and wish I had gone with this years ago.,1
"Really good for acne prone skin. It’s cleared up my face and kept it that way since 1st use. If it helps, my skin type is oily",1
"These work well, attach strongly, and make it easier to hold my iPad without hurting my arthritic fingers. My only complaint is the too-bright color.",1
This is a great story - it starts slow but worth the investment to stick with it. Lovely native stories woven together with the gritty realism of social ills and balancing tribal relationships is masterful.,1
Haven't made any recipes yet. But it looks like a great cook book.,1
"Product looks great. It's a much better solution than the clutter of numerous DVD cases. I marked it down one star because the cases are not self contained. It would be better if the binding portion of the ""book"" had a zipper to hold all the disks in.",1
I loved that you can change the position of the branches and just simply how it looks in my living room . I would have give it a 5 star but I would loved it if the color of the light will be “daylight” instead of bright white. I know there are bulbs available in the market to change how I wanted the color to be but that would be too much $$.,1
Very comfortable. love it,1
The color looks very rich and the fabric feels good on the skin. Runs a little snug tho.,1
"These are okay headphones, they are what I expected for the price so I'm happy with them.",1
I never leave reviews but this is worth saying something. It’s veary soft and it did shed but it’s an easy fix.I would buy 2 maybe 3 sets to have a decent look .,1
"Loved the case, expect the keyboard cover was brighter than shown in the description picture.",1
Book is good for used conditions but keep in mind that these kinds of books won’t come with an access code which is needed in certain college courses.,1
"Lost my old one for my Flex 4, so bought this one instead. Of course the day this arrives, I find the old one. *rolls eyes* Anyway, now I have a spare, I guess. It works fine.",1
"I love this cup-keeps liquids cold for long periods of time even in a ""hot car"". Hot liquids stay HOT as well! The problem is the cap...it is so dang difficult to remove and the rubber seal moves around! My other North didn't have THIS problem! HELP",1
"Liked the toothbrushes a lot, but it's early days so don't know yet if they will last at least 3 months. Can't use the finger toothbrushes with our dogs, but since we have three of them, wanted the three different colors. Will report back in 3 months.",1
Can't turn off the unit the fast charger work perfect,1
Got this for my great nieces and they loved it!,1
"This band is nice and soft. It is much lighter than the original rubber band that came with my apple watch. It compares to the genuine apple nylon sport band, but is made cheaper. For the price, I really can't complain. However, one thing to mention is the threading isn't perfectly consistent and some threads may come loose if you aren't gentle with it.",1
"Love the look of the case. Very minimal protection, but decent value for the price. I would recommend this case to someone who is not prone to phone abuse.",1
Very good product for bugs,1
"Put these in frames and hung them on my dining room wall. They look great-very classy and adds a nice pop of color to the wall. They shipped very quickly, and enclosed was a personalized note from the seller, which I thought was such a nice touch. Great pictures, highly recommend!",1
I’ve had a bottle of this soap under my sink for a long time. I couldn’t quite quit my Ajax habit. Finally decided to try it and now I’m hooked. I love the smell and I actually am using less per sink full. The only reason for the four stars is that it seems to dry my hands out a little more than I’d like.,1
"Highly recommend , I can use the cord or go wireless .",1
"I didn’t think this could work on my triple helix ear piercings, but I have to say, it does. I had been using sterile saline spray, and it seemed to be getting puffier and more irritated rather than better. I’ve only been using this for a couple of days, and it already feels and looks much better. Much less puffy and irritated. Pretty pricey, but worth it, I think.",1
Good product and fast delivery too.,1
"Not bad, but very often you need to play with brightness, contrast and saturation of original picture, otherwise you will get either too bright or too dark print (depends on original pic). But I still like it and would recommend.",1
This book was really well written . . . I liked this book a lot . . . . .,1
"I have continuously repurchase this over and over. My only complaint is that the green tea is very very mild, I am quite sure the green tea inside this is very minimal but I like the other ingredients inside this, meaning the fiber, the probiotics, potassium. What I do is I mix two teaspoon of this matcha, with one teaspoon of pure ceremonial first grade matcha powder from other sellers, and blend this with half cup of low fat goat milk and one cup of water and a little monk fruit. I drink this after my dinner and its so yummy, it really fill me up leaving hardly room for me to snack and it makes me sleep so much better because of the L theanine.",1
I ordered medium (typically I am a small) because I read the reviews that it ran small. I wish the tanks were a still little bigger.,1
"While this was a nice size and everything fit. I didn't like that the handle was on the side and not the top, which meant I was basically carrying my makeup side ways. However, I was pleased with it when it first arrived. After a couple of weeks it was just not functional for me.",1
The size was perfect! The quality is very good and held up during our very windy nights.,1
This product is worth the purchase and does what it says. Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target. If you purchase it you will see what I mean. If I'm wrong and there is a way then I still blame the manufacturer for not making it more obvious.,1
Hmm end up needing both hands to squeeze. I thought would be easier because of the design.,1
"Awesome case protects phone like it should , just need screen protector.",1
"My only complaint is that without drilling the extra two bottom holes into my vehicle, the covers are not as sturdy and secure. If I was willing to drill holes into my metal bumper, then these would be perfect.",1
Great looking but the fabric is stiff and somewhat harsh feeling to lay on.,1
"Have yet to decide where to put them, but love the different design. They came in the box with the five corner shelves. Now I have to decide which way up I want them. I like them very much",1
For my son worked great,1
The glasses are of good quality. I like them because they are anti-glare. They are definitely better than what you could buy at your local store. I can't find any cons with them at this time.,1
4 only because they started to shrink after the first wash,1
Wish the lenses were a bit darker.,1
Would have 5 stars because everything is great except the screen protector cracked the first day I applied it and I never even dropped my phone,1
"I had two reasons to love Being Brooke. I like watching best friends fall in love! My daughter and I represent two generations of women who married their best friends.; and my granddaughter just announced that she and her best friend are starting to date! My last name is Barker(a name given to me by my late husband). I nearly gave up on this book because this Brooke was broken. She wasn't quirky, she was just queer! The only thing I could work out about her was on the autism spectrum. That's understandable! Crazy for no reason is not!",1
Great color of dark brown. It was just what I needed for my dark chocolate brown leather couch.,1
"For the price, this is a great deal. I'm a little nervous about reviews saying the turntable stopped working - Hoping I won't need to use it for long, as my intent is to transfer all vinyl and cassettes to my computer. If you want to hook up speakers to the unit, you'll need to use speakers that connect via the headphone jack - most computer speaker sets would work.",1
"I like the case, it works well. I wish it came in purple. The only complaint I have is that it doesn’t charge well on the cordless charger.",1
"Good quality but runs very small. I’m usually a medium or large, purchase an xl for comfort and it barely fits. The quality of the shirt is nice though.",1
I love them so much I where are them every day,1
"Would have rated it 5 stars, but the storage doesn't lock or stay closed at all",1
"What a sweet and fun story. I loved that they were born th normal people. Single parents, living comfortably, adults...Loved it!",1
"My case finally delivered today, and I love it. I’ve purchased multiple cases, but had to return them the same day as they retained so much water. This case is perfect. The review gets only 4 stars because it’s says this item is black, so other may purchase and be upset about it. The case is space gray. It was perfect for me as my watch is Space gray.",1
Sounds great looks amazing just wish it came in a proper sleeve with album art instead of the clear plastic sleeve,1
"I had purchased one about a year ago, liked it now I purchased two more.",1
I have not noticed improvement in the teeth after taking product for several months. Maybe I am not taking enough. I take 1 capsule in the morning and 1 in the evening. It is kind of expensive to take more than that and it does have a fishy taste while in my mouth. I usually don't taste it after I have swallowed it.,1
Great to keep passwords organized. Would be better set up alphabetically.,1
"Still waiting for results it hasn’t been 6 weeks yet, but will order more",1
Significantly improves grip and one handed operation of my phone,1
". Fit my 2018 Accord pretty good the back part of the seat isnt fully covered completely but most is, Came a bit wrinkled but not to bad, material is actually good quality",1
"This product is quite sturdy (metal not plastic). Easily installed. However the flow restriction is more like 70%. Using a 1/16 inch drill bit, I drilled a hole in the center of the perforated plastic insert. That increased the flow but not to rinse the shampoo from my wife's hair. Through measured process I ended up drilling 2 additional holes (12 and 6 o'clock) for a total of 3. Just like Goldilocks I got it ""just right.""",1
Definitely a better look on the vehicle but I have noticed a significant drop of radio signal. I use the USB and Aux mainly so this isn't a major issue for me,1
"good stuff, butt you upped the price by 25%, time to go to home depot.",1
"Its a beautiful top but I had to return the medium to get a large. the fit was fine except for the hip area. If you have hips, order a size up from your usual, otherwise it won't hang right on you.",1
"I like the product but can't speak to effectiveness yet, price could be low based on the amount of product.",1
"The tin size is very small, I expected it to be more like an altoids container. However, it is still a cute product that my son will love, and it did arrive a day ahead of schedule.",1
"the side buttons for browser forward and back movement are mushy and not easy to know you've pushed them until something happens on the screen. Otherwise nice mouse, if a tad overpriced at the time of purchase.",1
very light but it works!,1
The product was bigger then expected but it works as it should. I'm very happy with it,1
"I enjoyed this mystery from the first page. The characters were a bit weird, and I loved the idea of old women playing detective.",1
Enjoy this series but found the newlyweds to be highly annoying in this book.,1
Good quality - stripped speaker wire and it came out real clean. I had an old stripper that just wouldn't do the trick anymore - good replacement. Seems to be well made,1
too much political talk,1
"Cute, fun, feel good movie. Yep, worth your time.",1
Great product! Easy to install and stays where you put it. Protects the leather seats from scratches from my two dogs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a few inches short of covering the entire rear seat in my full size crew cab pickup. I'd definitely pay a few dollars more for an extra large size. Should be no problem in most cars!,1
"I liked the price, color, fit, adjustable option & quality of the hat. I did not want a floppy beach hat, nor a dressy looking one & this one is great for everyday use & will go with whatever you're wearing.",1
"I wanted to try this and love it, it wasn’t really the best for me since my skin is super sensitive, you should definitely give it a try, the price is reasonable, the smell isn’t strong or overwhelming and the formula is pretty lightweight.",1
Little smaller than anticipated but quality seems good,1
"I measured my dogs necks so I could buy the correct size- they were 10 inches exact. Technically the XS was their correct size, but it would have been super tight.",1
Getting a solution to increasing your energy can be achieved on this diet. This is a step by step guide to preparing a delicious meal. i like these recipes and am sure to deliver this book to my sibling for a quick start on the diet,1
Very cute and fast delivery,1
"Pros: -Didn't leak. -Low chance of toxic shock. -You can wear it in preparation without any adverse side effects. Cons: -Uncomfortable if inserted incorrectly. -Super hard for me to break the suction and take out. I really want it to work for me, so I'm planning on trying it out again next time. All the reviews I've read have said how comfortable it is and convenient too! Hopefully I can get the hang of it soon!",1
"It's functional but I wish there were some drivers to map the buttons and adjust sensitive more. also, id' prefer that the illumination could be user adjusted. I just use it as a back up mouse, so it does what it needs to do.",1
"Everything was as excepted and delivery was very fast. I love this charger! Exactly what I was looking for, exactly what I needed! I loved it so much that I ordered another one for my son.",1
"The pencils lay down nicely and have nice vibrant colors as well as a nice range of colors. However I had a problem with them breaking a lot during sharpening, but I have found that the KUM brand sharpener works pretty well on these pencils lessening the problem. Now that I have figured out the issue with sharpening I will buy these again.",1
"As far as excellent tracking response I give it 5 stars, only took off 1 star because it's really cold since it's metal, but it's very handy to use when I'm on the couch or in bed watching movies. If I'm needing it for games involving track speed I use it. Might be due to my using the heater sparingly. It also has a good padded backing so no need to worry about scratching any surfaces.",1
"It fits decent. It did not seem to fit to great at first but now that it is broken in -- it is good to go. My problem with the case could have been operator error. I think several people said good things, about my plastic wood grain looking laptop case. I'd recommend it. Make sure you order the right size and model. :)",1
"I will definitely be reading more of this author. I enjoyed the plot, the character development and the introduction of the secondary characters. I look forward to the next in the series.",1
I love that they stick to my shoe even after i remove and reset a few times. I have been going to physio therapy for my heel pain and it helps for a few days that gradually returns. She recommended arch supports and I am wowed. I did not expect such fast relief. They pack of six was perfect for 3 shoes that I wear most. I am feeling so much better.,1
I purchased this item in order to cut back on the usage of plastic bottles. Perhaps not the best water filter on the market but I think it does a great job and I see no major difference between bottled water and water from this product.,1
I used this to color a flame for my chemistry class. It worked fine and was delivered as expected.,1
I ordered these because I have ordered this type of cable from this seller in the past. The cables are durable and flexible. They are exactly as described. Unfortunately on this order I was send 2 USB C and 1 Micro USB instead of 3 USB C. It's no big deal and mistakes happen. I processed a return through Amazon and it was corrected in no time.,1
I am very pleased with this product. Exactly what we wanted for our dog. Very happy with our purchase,1
I purchased this clock for my sewing room. It looks great! I think the price point is high for the size of clock.,1
Only reason I gave a four is because putting a wrist strap on the same end as the electrodes makes no sense. If you make contact with a person or animal they can get caught up in the flapping wrist strap and you lose your weapon. I suggest they make a removable strap for the opposite end for when you only want to carry this stick as protection and can sling it over your shoulder.,1
"Used them once so far. Have never used Cast Iron before, so we are still learning.",1
"Tasted very good for a vitamin. However, did not see any difference in hair growth.",1
Loved the color but the flowers aren’t in the same place as pictured. Didn’t like the huge rose in the front/at mid-chest,1
Goddaughter enjoyed it.,1
Just okay but fits decently,1
Couldn't put this one down. Love scary stories & can't wait to read the next one!,1
"I just love this case! It's very feminine. The reason for four stars is because the built in screen protector is awful! Made my phone look vintage. I already have a glass screen protector installed, so I put the case in the dryer and melted the glue and pulled the screen protector off. Now it's petfect! This will do until my custom case comes in!",1
"I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan.",1
Minor inconsistencies but perfect for my use,1
I like the notebook so I'm giving it as a gift . Thank you.,1
Does the job and one of the only I could find for grandson's LG Rebel,1
"Very comfortable, although the material is a little stiffer than I had expected. I marked ""fit as expected"" but I purposely ordered one size below what I would normally wear. It's a bit snug, but I'm happy.",1
"This is the story of a police night patrol featuring two (partners) officers. It is realistic and interesting -- depicts what officers do most of the time, and this makes it different. The novel is not a thriller nor a mystery, per se, more the routine of a night patrol. There is a human element as the reader sees into the lives and minds of the featured officers. As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series. Reviewed by the author of The Children's Story, About Good and Evil.",1
Nice toys but some are low in quality . The surface was rough,1
It was a good model.,1
These puffs come in their own little container making it easy to store. I use it to apply cc cream and it does a good job. It takes a bit to clean them and I find I need to use some rubbing alcohol to get it real clean.,1
works ok just a little bigger than I had anticipated,1
Great read! I bought the book on my kindle on Thursday and by Sunday I was finished. The book was great.,1
Product has too many requirements to work properly. But I’d recommend you buy and stay in contact with the seller because they’ll help you with any issues you may have.,1
"Runs small, cute 2 piece.",1
"I like the personality descriptions of the characters, but it moved a little too slowly",1
were is my free downloader app for my fire stick I never download it is not working without it having to many problems,1
"Put these under my kitchen cabinets. Hardly any hiccups for this DIYer. Bought the extension wire, 90 degree clips, and connector pieces, these were just OK. Nexlux could have a better description of what other pieces are required to do things like connect the lights to the extension wire and then reconnect after running behind cabinets and into a soffit etc. That part was tedious and cost them a star.",1
"Its good, does the job but a bit too thin. You need to be gentle otherwise it will tear. If its a critical job, dryer vent for example, you will need to double or triple it. 3M Heavy Duty is still the best though, so if quality is more important to you than cost, then thats the way to go. For every day jobs, regular duct work, this is fine.",1
"the taste was good. however when I received it, the packages were melted. I put them in the freezer and broke hem apart as I ate them. will not order them again for this reason",1
I’ve used the eye mask twice so far. No issues with them staying in place. I’ve already started to notice a difference in my eyes.,1
"Nice little case, I didn't want to spend more at this time, this is not the leather feel I would prefer but it performs the purpose of protecting my kindle admirably! I also find it attractive with a design in the leather. Certainly a good product for the price.",1
Just what I needed. Finding these was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that was 'just right'.,1
Works good in the car,1
"Very durable case, now I would let my toddler use the ipad.",1
"Better quality than I actually expected. Good amount of compression. I'm a nurse working 12 hour shifts, they have been nice to have. I only marked them down because the threads from the all over patterns leave marks on my legs.",1
Fairly good set. The only issue I have is the seam is really pronounced.,1
"I enjoyed the mystery in the story. I wavered a lot between the main character being nice, a ditz and just stupid with some of the things she was doing all with knowing someone killed her friend, was after her brother and trying to kill her. Even if she wasn't worried about herself, you would think it more important to solve the murder and send things than to endanger herself and others. I got this book for free and am voluntarily giving a review.",1
"Works great. You will need to get past the initial chlorine smell, as it dissipates. Use in the am for cpap equipment. No smell in the evening. The spray lock/unlock is counter intuitive, never seen this style before. Can be difficult to unlock.",1
"I really like this car seat for my puppy, he stays safe, while I drive.",1
"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed. As a result, the seat can actually rock side to side a little. This does not bother me at all when riding, and may actually be a benefit, but I worry that it will get worse as it wears. Regardless, what this seat post does is transform your hard tail bike into something you’ll will want to ride more, and it makes the bike more capable. I currently have it on a fat bike. I have another good full suspension trail bike, but I doubt that I’ll buy another FS bike, ‘cause you can get a hard tail and still have comfort if equipped with this post.",1
"Nice product, good quality which means a good purchase. Thank you.",1
"These actually work pretty darn good. Yiu can build it up, higher, or keep it short. And the cross braces add rigid and sturdy. I wish they had different size (length) cross braces, as the ones come with make you build it a certain size,because they are fixed length. It makes a kind of triangle structure about 12 inches each side.",1
"I got these for my 4 year old so she can transition to using ""big girl"" cups before she starts pre-k this August. They are the perfect size and great for kids just starting to drink from cups without a lid.",1
"Bought this for the table for our Halloween party. Cute, pretty durable, and as pictured.",1
"bought this for a Vegas trip, it was beautiful and fit well, but I didn't quite realize HOW low the v-neck was. Tried using garment tape but couldnt get it to hold--if you have a way to keep it strapped down, then I say give this one a try. I'm sad I didn't get to show it off on my trip",1
Its as good as they say it is.,1
Fit great. Only had one pillow case. Expected two. Had a funny industrial order when out of the box but was fine after washed and dried.,1
Great especially for kids. Why pay full price for a name brand with all the bells and whistles you get here with a MUCH better price!,1
My quakers love this. I can hear how they played with this little spoons. Quality is pretty good because usually my quakers destroys any toy in like a month but this one still good and look that may hang for a while.,1
I like that the case also came with a screen protector and the case is durable but isn't bulky.,1
I ordered this charge so I can keep this in my work bag for my laptop on the go. Good value and great price for the extra charger to have on hand!,1
Not super sturdy but does the trick,1
"Excellent price for the same mill thickness sold in big box stores. Came in very handy covering a large floor area, drywall job.",1
Love this dress but it's more of a bathing suit cover up because the dress part is completely see-through,1
This will be a gift for a family member. It smells nice !,1
Gave as a gift and the person loved it. Plus they had to wear a full leg brace and didn't want to put on socks so this worked perfectly.,1
Love the characters And the overlap into other myths And legends. These are well written great make you want more. Thanks,1
Love how realistic they look.,1
"I like the size a lot and that it is waterproof so in Windy NYC, I do not need to carry an umbrella, just a raincoat and the purse. My only issue is I do not like the interior zipper compartment. It is not needed. There are enough other zipper compartments in the purse.",1
A bit too detailed for me but interesting enough theories about how things could be to keep me going. This is a case of saving the human race against overwhelming odds.,1
Good deal for 4 mouth guards! Somewhat tricky to form. Good quality. I would purchase again. Not that I need it anytime soon.,1
"Feels great, love the high top, I wish I could pull it up better from the back",1
The product works as indicated but NOT as good as it described. I expected more for the price charged.,1
"This product is great, but the instructions suck... also, it took me and my brother over an hour to figure out why the Power Magic Pro wasn't working. We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going. I recommend turning on the engine to jump start it and then try to see if it works in parking mode when you turn the car off. Other than that, this product is awesome! The images are extremely clear. The cloud feature to be able to live stream is awesome! I highly recommend this product!",1
"Just got these so can't say much for durability, but like several reviewers said they're just a hair smaller left and right than the screen of my S6. Still debating of I'll keep it.",1
you can wireless charge through this case.,1
I love the top so flattering and sexy. My one criticism would be I wish the material was thicker. Because it’s thin I have to wear a strapless bra wish I don’t really need but too revealing otherwise. I wore last night tho and got tons of compliments!,1
I just laid them into an empty drawer as my furniture has yet to arrive. They fit tight and are adjustable so I think they will be perfect.,1
"Use it to hold my ipad on counter when cooking, closing it shuts off the unit, gives good protection to unit (know its coffee proof :))",1
"I like this, and wish it had fit me, It didn't but a friend I showed it to loved it and it fit her, it was close to her birthday , so a perfect birthday gift!",1
"The only thing I didn't like was the delivery time, It actually took 3 weeks, but the product is great. A great looking product for the cost.",1
Another great Louise Penny read. I am hoping she will continue the series but I understand if she doesn't continue..,1
"This was a great replacement for the bottom of our couch, but it was slightly too small to cover the bottom, so we tried to use three pieces to cover the entire bottom of the couch (to cover the holes our cats made) they, of course, found the seams between the layers and tore it out again. Would recommend if bottom of couch/chair is small enough to cover with a single piece of fabric. Was really easy to unfold/install (we used a staple gun to attach). Would order again if a larger width is available.",1
"Some fit really well, others are too loose.",1
"Pinches between ring and tube, extremely painful. Love that the end comes off, makes for great teasing and good cleaning.",1
Love the color-teal.. When you wash it has a TONS of lint. Once dried looks great. Love that it is 100% cotton. I'm hoping the next wash will not have alot of lint.,1
"X box is awesome , but I’m a little worried about the delivery. The box was set on my front porch this is a $300 plus order and it was also marked handed directly to me , no it was not !!!! I had a small panic attack when my Alexa notified me that it was handed to resident. I ran outside and it was on my side walk 😔",1
"Great price for this type of watch band. Fairly thin, but works as expected with a good magnetic closure.",1
Loved the product but the delivery person LIED about handing the package to a person. They layed it next to my door,1
Super nice product my large cat can not fit in the side basket or top bed but the cat tree is very nice.,1
Well made and simple pans.,1
"I liked the plot of Pulse and the author’s choice to focus on an underrepresented segment of our population in this book. The only criticism I have is that I guessed one of the villains when introduced, and I’m usually completely unable to do that. Still, the book is a great, enjoyable read for those who enjoy murder mysteries.",1
This is a great product and I’m sure it will hold up. The only thing o would change is a more secure magnet as mine have come loose several times. I would also like to see one more card pocket. I believe the photo showed more than 2.,1
Does not come with instructions on how to install. They would be nice. Especially since you need the front lights..had to go to YouTube to install this. Instructions would help alot...,1
"Nice case, huge capacity. Could use more micro item configurations/pockets. Would be nice if it had the rubber bumpers on bottom for when its resting on ground and to help stabilize. Otherwise very nice",1
"Love this dress! Wedding, school, it is perfect for any situation with the right accessories! The fabric is a bit sheer when stretched, but its soft and comfy!",1
"Accurate, Fits well, Good quality, fast shipping, good price, Great seller!",1
I love the wallet. Works almost as expected. Cards can not be inserted fully or they get stuck in switching than unable to remove cards easily. Other than that issue the wallet is great. I leave my cards inserted only 3/4 in to prevent issues.,1
Fragrance smells good. But it's really strong.,1
"The items were very soft, easy to launder, and I was very satisfied",1
My handy guy had a heck of a time with this thing. He said he had never seen one so difficult to attach. He gave up on the lag bolts. Very study once you figure it out though. The water heater is the only thing that will survive the earthquake.,1
"Way too small, go a size up when purchasing, other than that, they're great",1
have not tried yet will let you know at another time,1
Enjoyed the way this mystery unfolded. Based in Canada about a frozen corpse found on along a USA roadway. Hunter an ex detective turned truck driver is thrown into the middle of this investigation to help out his fellow truckers.,1
"What I was looking for: something to clip onto the existing car visor to significantly increase the area protecting my eyes while driving into sun rise or sun down. What this product is: a very well-made, tinted plastic (?) visor that clips onto the existing visor, then existing visor is folded down out of the way, leaving this product to do the job. However it didn’t work for me. The morning glare was still shining from all directions not specifically covered by this visor and still blinding me.",1
This case is very attractive. It holds and secures my phone nicely. I love the way it looks. Very classy. I have a black j7 so this case matches it perfectly. The downsides are the inside card holder. It's a very delicate mesh that rips easily resulting in cards falling out when using the phone not good ! so you have to be very careful not to overload and rip the sides. The magnet could be more magnetic it doesn't hold the case closed very well. The strap is very thin I had a sturdier black strap that I use on it instead of the one that comes with it. I am on my second one and although they do not hold up too long i like the look and the fact its not heavy. My first case lasted about 3 months before it ripped and looked a little worn around the corners.,1
Looks good. I wish it were just a little deeper. It will be useful.,1
"This book includes a quick trip to making hydroponics a part of saving us trips to the market to buy raw foods like fruits and vegetables. There are a few options you can make when it comes to your hydroponic system, but many times the roots of your plants will be suspended in, misted with, or flooded with a nutrient solution (you can design the nutrient system to meet the needs of your chosen plants), so that the plants still get everything they need. And that's just enough for me. So thanks! The book is very good.",1
Now this smells like the barber shop of old. Refreshing to have thoughts of a simpler time after you shave.,1
Will use at night. Really like the unit but sound control is to touchy,1
"Seriously, go to walMart, and you will get a better deal. Not nearly as good as I had hoped but it's sturdy",1
Theses beauties are unique and made well. Only con it that they turn my ankles and ugly black.,1
"Easy to set up smarthome plug. Doubles your outlet space without blocking the second socket. Each socket has a manual control as well as smarthome control. Not for 5G connections, which is a shame, but works well & has indicator lights around the manual buttons. Will be using this for in-demand countertop sockets.",1
"Bought for Samsung 11.6 Chromebook 3. VERY nice! Much thinner than I even expected it to be, which is good. I do wish it adhered to the keys/board a little better but overall, when typing etc.. It does NOT move around or slip. It's also thin enough that it doesn't prevent it from closing all the way. Great crumb catcher for my 10 year old!",1
"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",1
"I received it promptly, washed it and started using it. I like the taste of the water. The digital meter worked for a day and stopped turning on. I guess this happens. I don’t really need it to work but st least the water is good.",1
"I wanted a soap dispenser that didn't take up much room for our bathrooms. This works pretty well, although the pump is a little weak for gel soap. One pump didn't seem strong enough to work at all, but fortunately, there was an extra, and also it's a standard size, so I could use one from an old dispenser for one of them. In some ways, I like this better, as not too much comes out at a time, and so far, it's been reliable.",1
A very informative book to read. I would highly recommend it to those who is just starting. Give this book to all high school senior students!,1
"Includes so many items, perfect for road trips",1
"This is a great item to keep your dog from getting wet. A little hard to connect to your dogs collar without the dog getting a little anxious. The chain to attach to the collar is about 12"" so trying to connect it with the umbrella tapping the dog is a little difficult. However once I attached it my dog walked fine. It definitely kept her dry. My dog is a poodle/terrier and weighs about 15 ibs.",1
Bought for grandbaby! Loves it!,1
I love it. Few things I don't love is it's not as detailed as I thought it would be and the metal is not as strong and bends easily. Also wish there were two clasps on the back instead of just one so it'll stay on my vest without spinning.,1
"Inexpensive, it works for my cat.",1
They work great but you. Can’t plug anything else into the outlet because it takes up the whole thing and covers the lower one. Other than that it’s great. I have three of them in my room and use one remote.,1
Serves the purpose of what I needed this for. I just bought it to hold a set of drapes in a doorway. Just wish it had better staying tension because If you pull the drapes too hard you may pull the pole down too.,1
"It is OK, could be a little brighter.",1
Purchased it for my work phone. Only think I don't like are the flaps that cover the charging port. Makes it hard to get too and very annoying when you want to charge. But I just cut them off and I am happy now.,1
The dress is beautiful. The size I order was a little laser for me so go for one smaller size,1
"Bought this item for my 5 yr old son and he loves it, makes him feel like a big boy. Makes homework time go by a lot quicker since all his supplies are in one place.",1
Smaller than expected.. it’s also lightweight too and keeps falling off my baby. Keeping it though cuz it’s still cute.,1
They run small. Order a size up. I'm a small and I should've gotten a medium.,1
Fit ears good. One of the cushions on the ear pieces fell off,1
Such a cute pair of sunglasses!! Thank you so much!,1
I purchased the three in a series and have not been disappointed. Great cozy reading.,1
Top is very comfortable bottom is too loose.,1
It does the job well.,1
It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer.,1
The product was bought for my brother. So far so good! Trust me if there was something not right he would let me know. So for now 4 stars. Maybe will update as more time passes.,1
"Solid product....I expected it to be a little more quiet.....still not too bad. Have cooked several steaks and chicken breast in it....you will have the most tender and juiciest chicken you've ever had....just, WOW! Well worth the money, still tinkering with the temps, but so far so good",1
"I was surprised it actually taste like chocolate, and not a bad chocolate. My toddlers ate it like a candy and so did my husband and I.",1
"Nice quality but the handle sometimes gets loose, but all you have to do is tighten the screw. No biggie.",1
The material was VERY thin however so I will probably use as Long Johns,1
"I installed this as a courtesy dome light in my 2002 Ford Ranger XLT. The length was spot on perfect, but the girth of the cylindrical metal connectors was less than I had hoped. I had to use pliers to compress the metal tabs on my dome light to get a tighter fit. It's in there good now and this light looks and functions great.",1
I haven't quite finished but it's a good read.,1
All together good product. Could use some elastic around the leg holes to hold in leaks. Sizing chart was accurate. Put on a 16 week old Boston Terrier. Will leak if he unleashes his full bladder.,1
Kind cheap but do the job,1
"After searching for some comfortable office shoes for awhile I came across this one. I was hesitant to purchase but it looked like it would work. The first few days weren’t that comfortable because i was still breaking into the shoes. I got a blister the first few days. However, once I finally broke into the shoes I would definitely say it was worth the price. It’s comfortable when walking for a long time, looks well with most of my office outfits and very light! I have enjoyed these shoes thus far.",1
Just what I need to get telemetry from my Frsky receiver to the F4 flight controller.,1
"I've purchased black seed oil pills from multiple companies and I cannot be without them. When it was time to repurchase I chose this brand based off the added ingredients (honey). When I received the product I liked the dark color and I noticed the ""dark residue"" in each capsule. After doing my research, I found that quality black seed oil (unrefined) should have this residue. So far this product is standing up to quality.",1
Very cute and squishy. The heads rip easily but they are fun to play with.,1
"Good quality, and have the coating over the stones which is great. But my gosh are they a pain to twist apart at first. Bought a size 0, fits perfect.",1
"decent acting, script and direction.. and not too much gratuitous sex. i liked it and would even watch again :)",1
"Liked the storyline,but not the length of the story. Wanted to know if she can have a child or not.",1
These run big. If you want them to go under jeans or other pants then you need to go down a size. If you're wearing them as pj bottoms or just on their own then get them true to size for a comfy loose fit.,1
Very good brand holistic dog food Benny loves it better than Blue Buffalo,1
"It doesn’t really flatten my hair the way I like it to be, but it does remove the curls and gives great volume.",1
This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product. I did however have a bit of confusion in the beginning because the instructions were not clear so I googled. You guys might have to google too if you've never used a garlic press before.,1
"I like this tennis trainer because it’s got a bigger base that you’re able to put more weight in. The bottom is also nice and flat so it doesn’t rip over easily. The ball was easy to attach to the string. My kids had a great time with this, getting some practice in.",1
"Whenever we take our switch anywhere we use this. it's nice and compact, protects the system, and carries all of our games. It's super handy. Unfortunately it doesn't have any spare space at all, so if you want to bring extra joycons or pro controllers you're on your own.",1
Bought the carpet to match my paw print classroom theme! It is super cute but it did come with a stain on it so that is the reason for a 4 star review. I am hopeful it will hold up with my kindergartners!,1
"My picky kitty isn't a fan of much that is intended for her. I don't know if this actually helps with heat, but she has seemed to gravitate towards it this winter. Perhaps it is just the ""plastic bag"" sound that it makes, but if it makes her happy, for this price, I'll take it.",1
"Wheel fit perfect on my Road King... Decent finish... Was worried about handling capabilities from the 21"" I like the way it rides better than stock at least for me.",1
I love this holder. The brushes are not super durable so they need replacement,1
Not very user friendly.,1
"Who doesn’t love a cozy mystery including a bakery, that is till a murder. Nice touch of getting to know the sisters,and what they are up against. Plot flow, good description, and easy to read.",1
"Overall this is an amazing book! Only lost one star due to poor packaging, but besides a few bent and out of place pages this was great!",1
"All 4 cables are working fine. Charged Iphone 5s, 6s and Ipod. 6 feet cable is long enough. worth money.",1
It fulfills my needs. I just wish it would have come in black. It does not come with a charger nor short cords but it does come with velcro straps so that you can contain longer cords inside the station if you don't want to spend the money on short cords.,1
Works as AD. Not fast as new model but fast enough. Price for 2TB SSD is good enough,1
"I have mixed thoughts on this skirt. For 1- I’m usually a small, I’m 5’5 and roughly 120 pounds, but I had to order an XL to fit me (and it’s still a smidge tight) but still wearable. The color seemed brighter to me than displayed in the pictures. I ordered a burgundy and it still is burgundy but looks more red than I would have liked, maybe that’s just personal preference. Also kinda see- through. You can’t see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It’s jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc.",1
"It's easy to use, has a slight scent that evaporates as it dries. So far this has been the best for my small one. His previous owner recommend this and I will forever be thankful.",1
"Cook delicious, healthy and easy to prepare straight from my kitchen. This book all foods very good take this book you can weight loss easily.You can improve self-confidence day by day.",1
This product works great except for one thing. I have to get within 20 ft. of the thermometer to get the Bluetooth to connect. This works for me though because my greenhouse is very close to my house and I don't have to actually go outside to read it. But I only have one spot in the house to connect... I have only had this product for a short time so I'm not sure about the battery life yet.,1
great to have on vinyl.... wish they'd reissue CORE!!!!,1
"My fiancée loves his ring. Its great for the price, but it changed from rose gold to yellow gold in a matter of weeks. Kinda sad because we got it to math my rose gold ring. But still, it’s a nice weight, and very durable. Would recommend but not if you’re looking for a rose gold ring.",1
"I wish they were a little taller and that I had gotten them at the beginnings of the growing season. They were already up and had bloomed by the time I order the cage and had some difficulty putting the stalks through them. However, next year should not be a problem as they are in place before they grow back.",1
Beautiful but the seems split in the fingers after an hour of wearing at a cocktail party.,1
"These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head.",1
You may need to cut it to the size you need but it's easy to do.,1
Small is to large for twin XL,1
"This product is great for the price, it does what I needed which is add USB space. A neat feature is the light added to the USB hub and it changes colors about every 3-4 seconds.",1
cute but a little pricey wish it came in different quantities,1
These tongs work great. You can tell they are very good quality. Make it easy on your guests to hold plate in one hand and pick food up with the hand. Only reason I gave 4 star is I think the handles need to be rounded more.,1
"I love what this is, but... I placed the stand on a white dresser and it stained it. Then I tried to get it off and no luck. Great size though",1
"The cord is fairly substantial - long and heavy duty - more than you generally need if you have an accessible outlet, so this isn't for traveling light. But I used it every night on my trip and was able to charge multiple things at once which was very nice.",1
Overall seems sturdy. Didnt like that there was just on them...,1
Great value for a comfort shoe,1
"I am using this product because my sister in law suffers from seizures, an since she is taking the drops the seizures have decreased.",1
Like the product just fine. Easy to get one napkin at a time. Design is nice.,1
Started using this light for my newly propagated succulent leaves. Seems perfect for those spaces that you want plants but don't get much sun. After a week so far the succulents seem happy.,1
"these are great for the price but not sure how long they will last. they seem more cheaply made than store brand, but it is nice that you get 2 for the price of one",1
"These bags are exactly what I was looking for when trying to find bags to carry supplies to and from school. What I did not realize is that one of them is a little skinnier than the others, but overall they work great!",1
Grandson really into Disney cars and enjoys these.,1
"I love tho look of these chairs!! One and only thing wrong to me as a bigger dude is that the chair seat portion it’s self is a little smaller, I can fit inside but if I were any bigger it would be a squeeze! Cool looking, and seems to hold well so far!",1
"I like these headphones but wish the cord was longer. My niece uses them with her phone just fine, but when we plug into her computer she has a real limited range of movement. Really cute design though and good sound quality .",1
"Fit perfect got my MacBook Charging again 2012 13""",1
"These cartridges are reliable. I’ve been using the, for over 3 years. But the shipping package/box is terrible. There’s no cushioning for anything inside, and the cartridges just bang around in the box.",1
"I've read all the Joy Ellis Niki Galena books and the first Jackman & Evans. Lost Daughters is the best of the bunch. I thought it was very well written (with the exception of a few typos), had a great plot, and the twists & turns kept me guessing. The only thing I don't like is her use of fictional towns rather than real places! As a Yank with a British wife whose family lives in the fens I've spent a lot of time running along the narrow fen roads and visiting fen villages and towns. I don't understand why some authors take their creative licence to the point of creating towns and villages. I'm sure most readers would prefer to see places they can associate with rather than contrived locations!!",1
I like these boots and they are very comfortable but it took a few tries to get the right one. I wear a 10 in sneakers but settled on the 9 for this boot. The 8 fit much better around my leg but was just too small for my feet. Since it has free returns and shipping it wasn’t an issue.,1
Fits mt troy built 200 perfectly. Install was easy. YouTube video if you need help. Only giving 4 stars since it was missing the bolt so we had to get a new one to attach it. Otherwise would have been a 5 star review.,1
"Edited review (POST-con): LOVE this wig!! It's SO CUTE on and I got so many compliments for my Wreck it Ralph 2 costume!! I trimmed it a bit in certain places (it was pretty uniform on the top, so I cut some pieces to get dimension), and I pulled a LITTLE volume from the top (though it didn't do much, tbh). I wore it all day at the con and the ""tangling"" is minimal for what it is. For non-lace-front, this is great quality!",1
"He said it's a little big, but it's nicely made.",1
Very nice bloom and taste. I did not expect them to be so small packaged... Very nice,1
"Not quite sure, but I am consuming it with black Maca powder. I do feel more energy and better erection... Maybe you should try it as I am.",1
Pretty good for the money,1
"Haven't used it yet, but can't wait to see the results",1
They were exactly what I needed at the very affordable price and in many colors,1
There are not many to choose from that are reasonably priced. This one seems to do the job.,1
Excellent online basic management business guide book. So many things to learn. Very effective tricks & tips for taking the business top on the level.,1
"While these slippers are definitely comfortable, I found the wonderful cushion to have been squished down pretty quickly unfortunately. I still wear these often as they are easy to slip on and off and I can wear them to step outside briefly when needed. I find these to be my practical pair of slippers and while the extra cushion I had been hoping for is now deflated so to speak, I still find that they are comfy enough. They definitely are anti skid which is fantastic for safety and they are able to be washed, so that is also a plus.",1
"I love the way these look, different especially for the price, BUT the Velcro barely stays shut as my daughter walks. The leg/ankle section is too small when the Velcro is closed, hence why it opens right up as she’s walking. I’d be afraid a larger size would be too big in the toe region.",1
"this little cookie turntable is really great for decorating fancy cookies and cupcakes. I think it will be great for various craft projects , too, like clay figures.",1
Was literally mini you can't even use it without fear of using it,1
"Loved these initially, bright, worked as advertised. But one of the two I bought has already gone out. Have only been using it for 2 months and it's already dead. UPDATE: The company responded immediately when they saw my review and send me a replacement bulb. So great customer service!",1
Haven’t actually used as saving for move n new house. Reason for not giving a 5.,1
"Good knife for the money,",1
Very easy to install,1
"I've had this 3 gallon tank for exactly 1 year. The lights are still perfect. Filter still works perfectly. My major issues with the tank is the covering. The tank has a glass cover for the entire tank. It also has a thin black plastic cover for the filter. Unfortunately, the black thing plastic cover doesn't seal like the glass cover so it let's in dust, etc. With all that said, I LOVE THIS TANK. I want to upgrade from my current 3 gallon tank to a 10 gallon tank relatively soon. I won't be going with this brand for the 10 gallon tank because of the covers not sealing completely. With that being said, for someone looking for a fish thank that is small and great to have as a decoration, this 3 gallon tank is fantastic.",1
"These work well but when you get back in shower, it comes off and they tell you to continue to use it till you get to the color you want. How does that work whe. I see it on the white washcloth?",1
"Decent, but it does have a cheap feel to it. You can tell the plastic is really thin and the power/charging light shines through the case a little.",1
Love it... exactly what is described.. If i had enough bathrooms i would have one in every color.,1
"I bought this for my sister and she has been using it for a while. So far good. Though it cannot handle very top notch apps but that is expected for a phone of this price range. It heats up a little sometimes but that has not been a big issue this far. Overall, it’s a good phone for the price.",1
"It was alright, Looked very similar to picture",1
These lights are super bright and worked out perfect for both of my trucks,1
Actually works but difficult to open and clean out the hair. I feel like I am about to break it.,1
"These are my go to ink cartridges. Always work great & last a fairly long time. My only complaint is the price. Cheaper than buying at Office Depot or similar store, but still pricey.",1
"My co-worker had the previous model, which included retractable ear buds and a hard case for storage. She highly recommended it, so I purchased this more recent model hoping for those some benefits, but they were not included. These work great, especially for the price point, but be prepared to sacrifice those previous conveniences.",1
"it works but it’s hard to pull the bags from the bottom, I just pull it from the top.",1
"I got two of these for my headboard for more personalized and direct lighting than my bedside table. I enjoy the different light choices and dimmer feature. But boy was I happy when I needed to do a home repair. I plugged both into my laptop where I played the instructional video and stuck each light turned up full into the cavity of my washer. It was like daylight and the slim design allowed me to place the lights just where they were needed and get full illumination. When I first started working under my washer I was using my cell phone for light! If I had a flashlight at the time it would have been too heavy and awkward, these lights are very lightweight.",1
This case protects pretty well. Bought it for my son's 6x and he likes it.,1
"the antena booster work as intended, landing gear is good, but the visor cause problem for gimbal if u using push on lense",1
Gives you time to bring it in house and plan your next day trip with out worrying about battery going dead.,1
"Nice seat ... just wrong size, my fault.",1
"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",1
"I bought this for my husband. These are good and do the job. My only problem is that I wish the top was attached. It is quite a bit of work to get the bottle in, but once in, the drink stayed cold.",1
It does seem to make it feel cooler,1
I use this for making holiday embellishments to shirts that I don’t want to be permanent. It’s awesome - I just wish it had a *little* more staying power. I will purchase again!,1
Really like these. I wear them to bed under nightgown and they are so comfy. Don't pinch or ride up. I gave it 4 stars because the black one is much smaller than the rest so I can't wear them. I will reorder these.,1
"These chords are a good value but one of the two is already flemsy on the end to where it doesn't stay plugged in very well after just a couple of months. The cable part of these seems durable but the charging end could be improved. Overall, these are okay for the money especially since they are so long.",1
"It's a nice light mount. The only issue I have with it is that it turns on my handlebar. I even put some double-sided tape underneath it before I wrapped the strap around in the hopes that it would stay in one spot, but it still doesn't. It's strapped as tightly as it can be. I gave it 4 stars because otherwise, I like it due to its lightness and flexibility.",1
"these do help, will see how long they will last.",1
These need time to recover from shipping...like a few hours to adjust to your room and show similar readings. There were pretty accurate compared to other thermostats and thermometers but I wouldn’t bet my life on the accuracy. If you need lab quality you’ll probably have to spend more than a couple dollars but for most projects these should be fine.,1
"The dimming capability on the bulbs is not the best. If you dim it down to 5% it's more like you've dimmed it down to 50%. Easy setup, works great - just couldn't give 5 stars because of the above.",1
I wanted to give one star. Not for the quality of the book or the writing but for the story. Crushing. I'd like to read an update from the author.,1
I did have to iron it for some time carefully to get the creases to a point of not being a major issue. In addition I used thumb tacks on the wall to smooth it out. It looks pretty good for a cheap backdrop for a photo booth.,1
"Like the ease of clock to use with my project. Dislike I had to get special batteries /carbon bs alkaline. It wasn’t that easy to get hands put on, And metal bent easily.",1
i should've bought 2,1
Works good. Well made. Simple design. Easy to clean in the dishwasher.,1
this remote control is definitely not the same quality as my original controller ! It seems to work OK sometimes the buttons are less responsive I had to use the battery cover from the old one because the new one was a little bit loose Overall I am happy with the remote control,1
"They are ok, not hard but worth the money",1
Just started taking it. I like the fresh smell of the vitamins. I haven't noticed much of a difference in energy yet.,1
i enjoyed using this diaper for my daughter until it run out of stocks and i had to switch to huggies movers for the size I need. but it didn't irritate my daughter at all. good for sensitive skin.,1
"Overall the swimsuit is great- while it fit the body, it was too short for the torso. I am 5’7” and it hardly pulled up my chest. It otherwise fit great but seemed about 2” too short and would’ve had the girls falling out the top! The swimsuit is very high quality, gorgeous print and customer service is great though! I’ll just stick with 2 pieces for my torso length. I have several other Tempt Me suits and they are all perfect!",1
You can’t adjust the focus of the light ...imagine fishing at night and not being being able to focus in/out...but light is bright,1
Cute but feather are much smaller than pictured.,1
Works great and very easy to install.,1
Have to keep memory cards separate from cassette cases.,1
messy but does it's job,1
Great quality but TINY,1
"Nice protector, but I question its longevity as it got a small chip on the edge within a day of application. It isn’t totally clear, but is anti fingerprint.",1
"I'm no Chef, but the nice large size it good for flipping over omelettes!",1
The quality of this product is still surprising. Super glad I bought it again!,1
"I bought this about a year ago, and it still works. I only had a few issues, but nothing that made the tablet impossible to use. It was a great replacement after my Wacom broke. When I upgrade I will actually be able to give this tablet to my siblings without worry they'll have trouble with it.",1
Works well!!! Used them for my patio area provide a lot of light for it being small. However one had a loose part inside I could hear if I shake it but since they are hung it didn’t really matter! Turn on quickly,1
"Fast shipping, just what we needed.",1
"Good color, about as large as screen as I feel comfortable with.",1
"This was a great story. I understood at the end the angst Chrissy felt. I suspected the end, then didn’t, ....",1
Minor nit: Would be nice if it came with black screws instead of silver,1
"I bought these for riding on my scooter in town. They are great! They kept the wind and dust, dirt out of my eyes unlike regular sunglasses. They are polarized and are great for summer. They are hard to see with at night, maybe it's just me.",1
It's the size of a child's toy. Good to use for a light touch up before company. It takes a while to get the same spot clean.,1
Smears really easily but great brush size,1
"Kids loved the flavors. Were a little disappointed that the flavors were so unequal in the canister. 3 of some, 6 of others.",1
These looked great. They looked very nice on the wedding invitations we put them on. We only had one break and had a few loose stones.,1
Great product for the price. As accurate as it needs to be for my game. Wouldn’t make a difference if it was off a yard or two. Slope feature makes a huge difference!!! Gotta have steady hands though. The flag was hard to hit sometimes.,1
"I bought this for my kids for our camping trip. I loved it because i did not have to take them to the restroom in the middle of the night. Easy to clean up, no mess.",1
my 9 yr old daughter loved it,1
"These mirrors work great! They were easy to install, for perfect, and are very clear. They seem to be holding up through rain, travel and the car wash. Great price too!",1
PRICE IS TOO EXPENSIVE BUT TASTE IS GOOD,1
"I purchased this body pillow hoping it would help me after surgery. Let me just say, it was/is exactly what I needed! I couldn’t have made a better decision.",1
"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",1
"Runs a bit small, but still fit okay. The headband could be made more toddler friendly. My daughter did not like the hard plastic headband. Overall adorable costume though!",1
"For being tall I have abnormally small feet for my height, but they are wide. I ordered 8.5 thinking I would need a little bigger to accommodate my width for getting them on and comfort level. I could easily fit into an 8. Overall nice shoe. Wanted memory foam since I will be doing a lot of walking on an upcoming trip. Wanted a little different look for a slip on. Gave it a 4 since I haven’t wore them for intended purpose yet.",1
"This cool bug zapper is quiet which I like... I also like that it has a fan... I saw a tiny spider coming down so I picked up the zapper, put it in front of the spider, and it sucked the spider right in and zapped it...",1
"It seems strong and looks nice. It feels great on my face, I am happy with this purchase",1
Slow start but good read overall. It took me awhile to get into it but about halfway through it finally started moving quickly. I had a hard time putting it down. The ending was a surprise.,1
"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable. I'm happy with my purchase.",1
"This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze. Doesn't feel durable. But, all in all, great device for the prices.",1
very nice but I expected it to be a little larger. It is a good size for a table top sign though.,1
Looks great but pockets are smaller than I expected,1
"The organizer comes ready to go just open box but in drawers and thats it no drilling. I also found that it has some weight and is not flimsy. I found that the stackable organizer worked better in my garage then the kitchen because of the smaller drawers, but in the work bench or on the counter there are multiple items that fit in smaller drawers.",1
"Cute outdoor lanterns. I purchased two rubbed bronze ones. They have a black and gold color to them. They are not too bad for the price. I paired them with a real black, metal lantern and it’s hard to tell that they are plastic. The candles are bright. I like the timer function. I don’t have to turn them on/off every night and they come on/turn off at the same time. As you can tell, the candles look almost as good, if not as good, as the Luminara candle in my metal lantern. They were well packaged and arrived quickly.",1
"The game gets more complex as you proceed. You have to have a keen eye to get through it, and I enjoy a challenge!",1
Great lightweight suitcase. Comes with removable plastic covering to help eliminate scratches,1
It seems to take a while to charge it up to full charge. Maybe it is the charger cord that's bad.,1
"The track are a nice addition to the train set however it would have been nice to have more of them or at least some curved tracks, or at least had the opportunity to buy a package of straight and curved tracks.",1
Love these boots going my 2nd winter with them and they're still wearing well.,1
Did as advertised but in some urinals it did not fit well so we reshaped by cutting.,1
Little bit other types noise,1
Color doesn’t work but that’s ok price was great,1
Works great for that purpose but they aren't really well made. Ok for the money,1
Holds up nicely but also slightly tilts down.,1
"pros: -softest fabric ever, wow, so warm!!! -cutest design -fits p well round the body! cons: -short on the legs, even with having it fit a lot lower -buttons spread apart, so it can be a little chilly outside overall, rlly awesome!!!! bought for a costume to hand out candy 4 kids!",1
"It's beautiful. Hurts your armpits though, even after adjusting the straps.",1
I returned this because I failed to notice the size of the product. Found something different with coloring pages. These are very well made and really cute though. No complaints other than my own personal error!,1
I used it to check my honey. It worked like I hoped it would.,1
"Interesting premise. Storyline was difficult to follow at times. More tragedy than necessary, but it kept my interest until the finish.",1
"It was smaller than I expected, but the quality is good and it’s just as cute as the picture!",1
"Very cool shirt, vibrant colors, but weirdly out of proportion. Too short for a gift to my friend. Returning",1
"First off, I have to say the color is loveeeee. A lot of things I order in purple always come too light, too kiddish, too weird, too neon-ish, what have you. But this purple was deep and lush and I love it, the umbrella is sturdy and really good quality. Probably best umbrella I’ve had. Comes with a cover and while it may not have much functional use, it really keeps it looking sharp.",1
Good quality. Used for craft project,1
This is a great tray. The space for ice is not that big but it does hold some. I would have preferred for the trays not to be vented. When I use it for dips I just cover the bottom on a bit of foil paper or wrap. The lids are a plus.,1
"I'm 5'3"" 170 and the large was perfect! Love this shirt, one of the ties are messed up but I can work through it.",1
"Just what I wanted, fingers crossed it will hold up too lots of use!",1
I'm very happy with this purchase.,1
Very good product for the price. I gave 4 stars because it is a pain to tighten enough to keep it in place. The inside of the clamp should have some ridges so that it grips the spacers and will keep it in place better. Came from overseas and it was not mentioned online. I really did not like that. They had wrong address and it went to PA instead of MS. The shipper called me for directions and was kind enough to reroute it to me with no extra charge. It was slow to ship and it was very slow to arrive coming from overseas.,1
"It fit my Troy Bilt Pony and it's a good quality belt. Nothing spectacular, but better than average.",1
"Great read, also very informative about the game of football. Liked TO but really loved Poppy and her extraordinary group of friends. Guessing Maxwell and Brynn are up next, can't wait to read!!!",1
Great for a quick press! Love that it heats up fast! I totally recommend this! It works!,1
"Finally a game that has a good story and the choice of where to go.I realize that you need to make money to keep the game going, but enough is enough.",1
Large selection of burrs. Perfect for light duty jobs which is all I use them for. When they ware out great price makes them easy to replace. Gave 4 stars only because they are for light duty work only in my opinion .,1
Very good game. I enjoy the challenge. Some of them are easy and some are hard to get. You can enjoy a lot of time playing.,1
Good for sore muscles as well as decongestant cold relief.,1
Gave as a gift to my friend and she loves them both,1
I got the product today but didn’t get the free scoop that it supposed to come with it . Disappointed.,1
Went pretty well. Hardest part was getting the case opened. The plastic tool didn't work so well for that. I had to improvise.,1
"Tripod comes apart alot, but just screws back in.",1
"Pics are smaller than the original Polaroid cameras from 30 years ago, pics come out slower and quality is about same.",1
Must have to use in water softer systems,1
Could have a bigger pocket for my package but they fit well,1
"Loved the style and quality however while wearing the ring kept turning upside down so instead of seeing beautiful design in ring, I saw a ring gap. Also nice and shiny until I went swimming in chlorinated pool, than it turned an ugly dull gray.",1
Got this for my 05 escalade EXT. I assumed that the fog lights would be identical but the bracket on top has a wierd indent that lowers it where the stock bracket is flat. I solved this by putting a few washers between the mount and the bracket to lift it so it's centered.,1
I received white rose lights instead of the pink ones I ordered.,1
The screen protector was delivered promptly and so far no issues with cracking and it has protected our phone. It's only been a week since we installed them. Not much use from them yet. Be glad to do review in a month or 2.,1
"The stone is beautiful but the setting is loose, the stone already fell out. I’m glad I heard it fall.",1
"Love the wig , its just hard to do the front,I will fix and tweak it,the wig looks like the picture",1
"Used on my ice maker, worked like suppose to.",1
This device is functional and has nice features. The clips are small and a bit hard to attach to anything of size but you can do what you need to do. Fantastic value.,1
The animal print is great and realistic. I just wish instead of the whole cats face its just the cats mouth.,1
Grinder works pretty well,1
"It fits the YI 4k perfectly, placed a lanyard on the cover and it has a couple of hole to tie it to. The problem is the YI camera keeps locking up that you need to open the camera to remove the battery. One star off is because the black one attracts lint that makes it took like a junk camera. The while is translucent and it would have been nice if it is white. Overall, I decided to just keep the camera naked and just buy those tripod screw eye to hook a neck lanyard to protect the camera.",1
"Very pleased overall. I'm glad I tried these on at a local store before ordering on Amazon though. Per the sizing guide, it recommended medium. I have average to small hands but had to order a large. It's still pretty tight around the thumbs when trying to take them off. Very sturdy gloves with Velcro that stays put. Protect hands very well even with aggressive weight lifting.",1
"Titan series heroes are very good for your child's first Marvel or super hero figures. No small parts, minimal articulation. We have five or so different characters for my son and they are very durable. Very pleased with these items. Nice prices for these here.",1
I needed a new phone case Bc my other one broke. And it looks great! I have a black phone and the black case with the gold makes it look even better. Couldn’t be happier!,1
Arrived at the end of July and on delivery time. The mat itself: The Good: -came with a free gym towel -came with straps and sleeve for storage -came with pvc pipe to roll it on -feels good -the price is good The Bad -the only issue i could see is the material probably would not be suitable for dropping weights on. But then again this is a yoga mat. Overall: 4.5/5,1
"If filled the inside, the outside pockets were restrictive. Didn't fit under seats on any flights (domestic or international). But was light and worked well for what I needed.",1
Just what I was expecting. Looks really cute.,1
"I have fair skin, it’s slightly to dark but I can make it work. Very well packaged for opening. Not a loose powder. Love the highlighter!",1
"Each of the mounts are sturdy and easy to use. However, the only one that will work with my Galaxy 9 Plus in an OtterBox Commuter case was the windshield mount. The phone fits in the holder, but the other mounts cannot support the weight. I gave it to my boyfriend for his small phone and it is perfect.",1
I liked this book for its raw grittiness and drama. Lyric went through several ups and downs and betrayals but kept it real. The book was a quick and easy read. Remember folks- Write a review to help an author out.,1
So thin...I could gather info from Google.,1
I used these to add vinyl and personalize them for my nephews with names that aren’t common! Perfect!,1
"If you have a knack for putting things together, you'll be able to assemble this with your eyes closed. But if you follow instructions, the drawings here leave something to be desired. I finally used the picture on the front of the box to give me guidance I needed. Other than the minor glitch I just described, the product is well made, does the job for which it's intended and I'm happy with it.",1
"Can’t complain, kids loved them. They stick to the walls and super stretchy.",1
"I really love this keyboard. The only thing I would say is that sometimes the Y button won’t work on the first time, but other than that its great.",1
The weights arrived in a good time and met our every expectation.,1
This has worked for me. The grandson can’t push it down . He does not try to put toys under it either. I just make sure we are in the room with him. It works better than what I had up around the banister.,1
The urn was as described is lite weight and looks nice,1
"Are fine, just a bit big for a small thin person who is me.",1
It was of good quality but pretty thin.,1
Just what I expected. Took stain beautifully! Very happy with my project. Pretty heavy block of wood.,1
great product should have bought it in the 8' length,1
The costume turned out to be better quality than what I expected. The costume was a bit small though.,1
Up and coming brand. The stuff goes on nice. And you can either give it that flat look or shiny. Held on well for two days. But like any other tire dressing it didn't last past the first rain.,1
"Feels good in the hand. As other reviews said, the stitching on the M emblem is a little dodgy, but for the price it's a great upgrade.",1
It is worth it for the top! It is really flattering but the highwaisted bottoms just hit at an awkward area for me. I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C.,1
"This case is very pretty, yet professional looking. The rotation is important for me and works well, and I also like having a stylus holder and pocket for business cards etc. As others have mentioned, it is difficult to remove, but I rarely need to once it’s set up. The only other improvement I would like is that there are only two positions, a third would be perfect. All in all a good choice for the price.",1
This product worked as excellent as described. My home was left with a bunch of cut wires on my built in home audio at the network panel and Ethernet jacks. I’m not a professional but for what I needed to get done and it worked great a little background noise but not issue for me.,1
A little big but good quality.,1
"It’s STUNNING and the shoes are perfect, very high quality all around. But the glitter on the dress does shed a bit. Overall, I’m super impressed with it.",1
The magnetic closure works great. The only criticism I have is that the folding part that is supposed to act as a stand doesn't really work that well.,1
Like Palmolive Dish Liquid better I think,1
"We had a big party and did about 20 pumpkins. Best to have a rubber mallet or two. Will also need cutting tools to get the top open and a scraper to empty the guts. These lasted the whole party and only a couple got bent (probably from misuse). So if you only do a pumpkin or two a year, this will last for 10 years",1
"From a 1 time regular wear, they start looking old & worn. Price wars good, we needed socks, these work for now. PRO: they are comfy",1
This phone case is a little bit bulkier than I expected but after having it on my phone for over a month I’m use to it. Love the back!,1
"needs auto cut-off for alarm, loud alarm tone",1
"I was pleasantly surprised by the material used in making this curtain. It makes my bathroom look fantastic, fancier than what it is. The curtain darkens the room just like it states it would. A great purchase, I would recommend it to my friends and family.",1
"got gel polish off, but took 2 applications after buffing nails",1
Pretty good for cheap hydrometers. One was way off but I suppose that's not too bad.,1
Great little book to help introduce yourself to some of nature’s little gems.,1
Bought for my nephew. He seemed really tickled.,1
"It definitely produces ozone. We have it in a bathroom where the cat box is, and that is the only reason we got it: to deal with those odors, which it does easily. It produces far more that needed for that job. Which would be OK, I figure the excess will get pulled out by the central vent system that is in a nearby hallway, and be spread through the rest of the house and possibly give some benefits. But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more.",1
Very convenient! Has different force. Good for yoga and daily stretch. We also use it for working out and muscle gaining.,1
Requires long term use to make decision.,1
Imagery is beautiful. Card stock isn’t the best. Peels quite easily.,1
"There are many features about this water bottle that I love. These water bottles do not leak once the lid is closed properly, they keep cold drinks cold for many hours, and they are durable! Since they are stainless steel, they will dent if dropped, but that is to be expected.",1
"Fit well, color selection is blain, go with the smaller pack if you are in question of whether you would wear them all. Good quality",1
"I enjoyed using this product, very helpful limit more space for my use. Thank you",1
Fairly comfortable ankle weights that can be weight adjusted. Good for increasing resistance in light workouts. Useful for back exercises that use legs.,1
My dogs like them but I can't tell that they help get rid of the fleas,1
"While this product broke and I had originally written a negative review, customer service of this company reached out to me and gave me a full refund, so I am quite happy! The actual ottoman was great before it unfortunately broke on me.",1
small device unlike those old wide players. Thumbs up,1
"Does it’s job but it just feels cheap in my hands. The seam between both sides of the cases noticeably feel awkward while holding the handle. For the price, it’s a great buy though.",1
Good fit. As expected.,1
"Nice looking, great fit and good quality.",1
"Nice goggles, clear vision and easy to fit.",1
"Love the product overall, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the way it’s packaged. It makes it difficult to unravel because you have to be careful not to have the ornaments fall off, and one did but its fine",1
very black and good for precision but taking one star away as it takes too much time to apply,1
"Fit was as expected, however the pants length fell just above the ankle.",1
Cannot thing of anyone that i would recommend the book to as i know no one who like science fiction?,1
Great shirt fit as expected love the saying.,1
"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.",1
"It was different to install, but if you follow the directions they give you, everything turns out better than I thought it would.",1
I wear a size 8 shoe and fit in a size 7 muck boot. Boot is very comfortable!,1
slow starting movie but gets good and the ending is good,1
"I purchased it mainly to be able to vacuum the gravel without having to drain the water. Worked well, only down side is if gravel particularly dirty, you may need to wash the screen frequently. Regardless, I'm glad I purchased it. To me, it was worth it and saved me time.",1
Love that it stays for a long time. But don't use overnight might turn white.,1
"This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that’s right RUST. Perhaps it’s from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn’t bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn’t shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don’t get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though.",1
"Custom is what I expected, quality is good. My nephew loved it.",1
Had to order a second round of the glass as the first one arrived damaged.,1
"limited on direction of choice. wanted the in pipe to be on the side but is only set up for the water to come in the middle pipe and split left or right, I wanted the water to flow in from a side so i could divert the water straight or off to the left making it a 90 degree bend. Works well though, I just had to re arrange some piping.",1
Just a nice product overall!,1
I love them but smaller than I thought. Bought the medium and had to send back and exchanged for Large.,1
It serves it purpose but is flimsy. I had it bite my fingers a couple of times while folding it back.,1
"I just got the bag and only used it once. It kept my ice cream from turning into a smoothy during my trip from the grocery store to my home. It was a sunny 90 degree day. So, I am happy.",1
"Even though I returned it I gave it four stars because it worked as advertised. One should be aware that for the garment to do the lifting and shaping that it does, It requires the seams to be very heavy and I found the anal area to be uncomfortable, however I know with time I probably would have become used to it, but I chose instead to try a different product.",1
Lots of things to watch just wish they had more up to date movies,1
My daughter loves the new night light.,1
The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,1
They pulled me into the story. But would have liked a little background information on the way the whole school and cities came to be.,1
I gave it to my grand daughter to wear. She really liked them,1
This plant is pretty good for the price. Does appear slightly artificial up close but looks great from a distance.,1
I purchased this as a gift. Recipient loved it but found it a tad confusing. Thankfully I had gone through and figured out how to use prior to gifting. I would recommend that manufacturer tweak information that accompanies product so it’s easier to figure out.,1
"When I recieved it, the outer sleeve was kinda banged up that was it tho everything else was perfect it's definitely worth it for the price",1
It matches well for under my eyes. Was in a car accident & have permanent dark damage under one eye. Covers it nicely. Lasts pretty long and covers up scars. After some skin cancer surgery the Dr. recommended this to help cover the scars which it does. Very creamy! Does not last if it gets wet however. Need to reapply if you cry or your eyes tear from allergies,1
Very cute. I didn't read the dimensions but its smaller than expected. Good for key holder.,1
The time I ordered it until I received it was good. I felt the shipping cost was too much. Can not verify the effectiveness of this product until I take it for some time.,1
"Over all, a nice dog house, but contrary to what the description says, the roof does not come off. Ok, in theory one could take it off if one wanted to remove a bunch of screws and didn’t mind the whole thing falling apart. So, it really does not come off. That said, the doorway is huge and I don’t think it would be difficult to wash it out that way. The assembly was easy enough by following the pictures. Although a couple of screw holes didn’t line up perfectly, these were not much of a problem. I doubt that the house would be completely water proof - maybe - but I’m using it under a patio, so that is not an issue for me. I wish there was a door flap available.",1
"I think this hat is best for people with thick hair. I have very thin hair, the pony tail has to be so high, to fit through the hole, that what's left of my pony tail is pretty straggly. I'm going to try a top knot next time I wear it",1
"The ring is pretty, diamond accents are very small.",1
"works just the way we want it to. Just wish it had a backlite so it could be seen better in the dark. As is we have turn on light to adjust if we need to adjust,",1
The cover works just as described. It is easy to put on and works well. It did not cover my umbrella completely at the bottom is the only reason I gave 4 stars. Could be my umbrella.,1
"not the best, but this is keto - it is good",1
"Amazingly these fit really good. Didn’t show any of my cellulite wow, also helps hide muffin top. I ordered more.",1
"The magnetic closure is not very strong; otherwise, the case is what I wanted and needed",1
Perfect pricing and lovely. One figure came damaged but for this price it's Worth it.,1
Very comfortable shoes.,1
Was snug for the size. I ordered larger size as well. Nicely made though.,1
"I liked the product! They were smaller than I thought, but loved the light show, especially for this time of year! Also the remotes- how fun. Would definitely recommend. I’d love to put them in my moms house, she would enjoy but not sure what her husband would think.",1
This is perfect to replace my high end purse strap. It matches really well. The only downside is that it feels a little light and not as durable.,1
"I like this punch bought it for a friend and decided to get one for myself. It’s a pretty punch, it does stick at times, if dropped it hasn’t fallen apart yet, I think it’s sturdy. Works well on paper.",1
"It's a magnet, haven't used yet, but expect it to hold keys.",1
I have had to use these a lot recently even though they were purchased for camping. They are easy to use and work great in all the rooms needed in.,1
The product came in time for the birthday party. He liked it and said it works great and gives him the back support that his office chair doesn't,1
"These are really nice quality cards. They are not glossy, but I like that. The design is really cute, including the inside graphics. A really good value as well. Envelopes are good quality, too. Will order from this company again.",1
"These cables are wonderful, And the customer service is great! Nice, Feel good. In my family it is necessary. These cables are a great value. I'm extremely satisfied with the speedy delivery! Exactly what I wanted.",1
Work as stated will order again .,1
Super fast and amazingly reliable whole food recipes which call for staples ingredients and require very little time to cook them – this is the best possible choice working person like me can make. Huge help and inspiration - that's for sure!,1
Stressful to transfer from previous box Xbox one,1
"Well, I was sceptical at first but gave it a shot. Turns out it works or atleast seems to cut down on my sons fussiness quite a bit. Plus I liked that at the closure point it easily comes apart so less worry about strangulation, which was the biggest concern I had. (Never leave infant with necklace on without supervision or while sleeping)",1
It was nice but some plastic parts are low quality.,1
Does exactly what it should with ease. I did have to re-glue one of the rubber cushions/grips on the bottom after about 3 months. But still does what it should with minimal (if you consider that anything) maintenance.,1
Need the inner frame so it's harder for it to break or crack screen. It's very stylish!,1
"Just what I thought I was buying, no complaints.",1
Definitely works for my small space but it’s not easy to install. I live in an building with very high ceilings. You have to adjust from the top and with the small space I had to stand on the toilet to get it to the right height then get my head between the wall/counter and the toilet to tighten from the bottom. Like I said it works great but took more effort then expected.,1
Color is fine. I have ordered several times.,1
A little thinner than I expected but nicely made.,1
"After researching Monk fruit I found these. Came in good packaging, I cracked 1 open and boiled it to make the tea. It is defiantly sweet, I add water & Ice and it tastes like sweet tea to me. after a month, I cracked another 1 open and it was still good and made more tea out of it. Happy with it, hoping it does have healthful benefits. thx",1
It works well for getting into tight spots. I just wish it worked with an Iphone.,1
Easy to assemble and easy to install. First night the walkway was adorned with light.,1
"Documentation for the camera was poor, or non-existent. This camera has so many modes and features that a full scale manual should come with it. I got into modes/screens that I couldn't figure out and the ""Start Up Guide,"" was worthless. Trying to find the manual online was another headache; never did find one...",1
cool I like it.............,1
Arrived quickly and in sturdy package. The palm rest is perfect and was a breeze to install. The touchpad was easy as well but honestly it is a little too thick for those who use it exclusively. All together it is a solid product.,1
These slacks are the best I have gotten yet from Dickies through Amazon. They fit better than others and they look sharp.,1
"cute, however I could tell that my miniature schnauzer was not comfortable in it.",1
Like everything about it.,1
Great to refurbish a compacted lawn. Assembly is a pain but this is heavy duty and not cheaply built. Local hard ware store visit is needed to buy blocks for weighting down. It tore up my clay perfectly with deep plugs. Down side is getting on and off the lawn mower to raise/lower the times when coming to a driveway or sidewalk.,1
Was surprised by a few things I learned about Mr. Gable. Interesting,1
"This has performed quite well. We bought it during the fires in Northern California when we were having very bad air days. What's amazed me is how much dust it picks up from the air itself. I vacuum the screens every week or so and they're quite full of dust. Which we're not breathing now, so that's good.",1
"Have only used it for a couple of days, but so far so good. Has made a difference cooling a 2nd floor bedroom that is at the end of the HVAC duct runs and is always warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than the rest of the house.",1
It will help a lot driving there. It helps too on the travel planning before going to New Zealand.,1
"I had just gone through my last laundry hamper and was in desperate need for a replacement. This does the job, is durable and can fit a weeks load of dirty laundry.",1
I like how warm they are.,1
"If you are making a dish that needs to be stirred, do it with ease or you will tear the liner thus defeating the reason for having one. It makes cleanup so easy and leftovers can be lifted right out of crockpot and placed into leftover dish. Love them. Would give them 5 stars if they could handle being stirred.",1
"Nice case, even though they make it sound like its for women theres nothing feminine about it.",1
Rope completely broke off after a couple of months,1
The color is not what I would call dark Navy. Or I should say the shirts I received. They look more like a mix of gray and blue not dark anything.. The size is good and they fit. I kept them as the color does not make much of a difference to me. Ron,1
Tasty. Seem to have more regular and larger BM. Been recommending it to my family.,1
The belts are good. They look good but were too small.,1
It says it’s for the GM but it’s a bit small and there’s room on both sides of my purse,1
"Great puzzle, but has to be assembled perfectly to work. Self made gauges are great. But would like a final view of how the gears should mesh. Mine are slightly out. I will have to guess which ones align and get them to mesh better. This will strictly trial and error as I have no view of the final product.",1
I wear a 10.5 and they fit perfect,1
MUST HAVE MISREAD AD WAS NOT AWARE THAT SCREEN HEAD DOES NOT DETACH FROM RAZOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OTHERWISE GOOD CLEAN SHAVE,1
Great product. Only complaint I have was in packaging some paints did leak. Otherwise excellent!,1
It didn't stay opened very well when bent backwards.,1
It’s a great jug! The only I don’t like is it’s a pain to clean because the material Will stain. Past that very satisfied,1
Similar to Neutrogena and less expensively,1
This backpack looks good and performs well. It’s a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There’s more straps on this bag than I can count. I’ll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren’t really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I’ve made this my new school bag for college. There’s a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it,1
Really interesting history of food in the south and great recipes. Haven't finish reading all yet but very enjoyable.,1
It takes at least two people to put it up. I had to get out plastic washers and wood screws to put it up on my wooden fence.,1
Not exactly what I expected but surprisingly pleased with the product. It is quiet and a perfect size for my 20 gallon aquarium. I would definitely purchase again.,1
"Love this protein, but what’s with the price fluctuation? I swear I’ve bought this for $23 before, and it’s currently $30 before tax.",1
"I love this wallet, looks exactly like the picture. The strap broke off after about 3 weeks but I just connected it to the zipper and still looks great",1
Order was correct and on time. They looked really cute when blown up. Only thing I would say is that the string provided wasn't long enough to fit all the letters on. I had to make shift a second string.,1
Nice body scrub puff. Its thick and lush.,1
Love the table but I have to keep legs tightened so not to wobble.,1
Purchased this for an elderly relative. Had to leave before I could find out if it worked out.,1
Awesome case!! Very durable and my phone has not cracked. Only complaint is that it gets very dirty very easily :(,1
"I got this product my mom. she loves it, she says it fits nice and comfortable",1
Easy to wire up easy to install great price,1
A bit smaller than expected but not enough to deal with the hassle of returns.....,1
"Good product! Perfect size, cute, and easy. Glad I bought this!",1
"Overall I like sprays more than this bottle, because it’s harder to spread the product evenly on my hair with my hands. But it’s definitely the way to go when you’re travelling, especially without a checked in bag!",1
A good mens leather belt with perfect fit to the waist. Adjustable to waist size too.,1
Product is in good working condition. The only issue is the skin does not fit to the controller perfectly. It stretches and often overlaps the buttons/triggers when in a serious gaming situation.,1
"It works great and is very easy to use, a little tricky to set the clock but for this price I think is most then I expected",1
Really hard to put on & drive with BUT super fluffy & cute I love it 😍,1
"Her office routine and morning routine are wonderful. They are not too complicated or hard for a beginner like me, and yet I could feel the movements were helping me to stretch and relax some very tight muscle groups. I would recommend especially for a beginner like me.",1
"I find this to look better, be of higher build quality, to have a better fit and to be more affordable than it has a right to, but one thing bugs me: it's difficult for me to push the power button on the iPhone 6S when it's in this case. I can do it, but it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it ""click."" Other than that, I've dropped the phone a couple times and this case has protected it very well. It's really grippy, which I love, and isn't so thick that the phone won't fit in a holster. And I love the super-visible color, which makes it difficult to misplace my phone. I recommend this case.",1
Was kinda hard to put the screws in because holes were not predrilled,1
My book club read this book recently. We all liked it for various reasons. This book provided us great entertainment.,1
"It works as well as the original, but it isn’t the same. The membrane vinyl over the wire seems thinner than the original. Also it stretches in a different way — in stretches in segments rather than as a whole. Although the vinyl is thinner, hopefully it is more resistant to cracking like the original.",1
These stain markers work vey well for touching up stained wood furniture if it has been scratched or chipped. The stain does not adhere to all surfaces which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I will also add that this is one of the better stain marker available and I have used many of what is out there.,1
"Started right up. Works great to run a simple app with java 1.8 installed. I do not use a browser, so I cannot speak to internet. Touch screen works well, I have no complaints. Just remember, you get what you pay for. this is not a Cadillac.",1
Great for working outside!,1
Perfect for adding powder to a water bottle I use it for energy drinks on the go and my dogs go dog.,1
Very soft and not too clingy. Still shows curves nicely though.,1
"LOVE the look of this case and I love that it has a kickstand type thing! The only problem is that when I watch things, I generally watch landscape (main use for my iPad), and the stand just doesn’t seem to work well for landscape! I keep a chip clip with my iPad so I can use it to keep it up! Love that it’s clear so you can actually see that my iPad is rose gold! And the rhinestones are cute too, and I haven’t had any fall off, which was a fear before purchasing!",1
"There is definitely ghosting on the other side of the page when you write, but I can live with that. I bought the white one which has stayed surprisingly clean through months of daily use.",1
"I have had this product for less than 2 weeks so my experience and results are limited at this time. That said, so far I do like the product.",1
"Case is nice, it's more hard case than that rubbery feel some cases have and I like that. Only downside is the brand name on the case, I got a clear case to show the phone. I'd prefer it not to be there but it's not a huge deal.",1
It doesn't smell as good on me as my friend.,1
"If your a rick and north fan , you will be living these comics. Even if you have never seen the show these comics will keep you laughing and well entertained",1
"Very nice Dress, thin, need slips under",1
I love the backpack. I thought it was gonna be a little bit bigger than what it is but overall i like my purchase,1
Product worked well only complaint is that it doesn’t come with a gasket so you will need to get one or you can use flex seal or something similar to create one,1
"The bags are extremely durable and hold their vacuum well in the freezer, which is what I really bought them for. I had some problems evacuating some of the bags and contacted the seller who was extremely helpful. Since it appeared that the pump was at fault, he replaced not only the pump, but the whole kit, bags and all",1
"I like the color. It suits my wedding Invitation theme. I gave it 4 stars because it's thin. Still workable though, I think the advantage with this kind of envelope is that you can bulk it up with invitations and rsvp's. Compared to a really thick but snuggly fitted envelope",1
Good read easy to stay with. Couple of twists and turns to keep you guessing. C.J keeps writting I keep reading.,1
"A super helpful book for the ones who wants to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It encouraged me to achieve the much-needed balance between work and health, wealth and happiness. Really nice!",1
So far battery life is not as long as I had hoped for with battery replacement and the prediction of battery left seems to fluctuate- but I’ve only charged it twice since I received it.,1
"I had items in my leather wallet that I didn't really ever use, so being able to carry the day-to-day items only in my Fidelo wallet is working great. I no longer carry my wallet in my back pants pocket, since the Fidelo is thinner, which gives me greater security from any pickpocket. It fits fine in most of my vest or coat pockets. So far, I'm enjoying it.",1
"Good quality and soft. They do shed a bit, but I imagine any others would too. I would buy again.",1
"For the most part I enjoyed my shopping. I would like the item represented more to size,color,shape etc. A written representation would help. Delivery,payment,things like that were very simple and made the experience a good one. Thanks",1
Quick game. Do not like that I need coins to play.,1
works really well on glass (without falling)...,1
"not the best product from this brand, the smell is a bit strong. would probably try another product by shea instead",1
Not as comfy as my old ones.,1
"Our miniature schnauzer LOVES this chew toy, but it only lasted about two weeks before he had it completely shredded down to a small lump (which he is still chewing). So a bit expensive to keep replacing them every two weeks...",1
"These are very cute and the nylon is soft and stretchy. They are not all the same size band though. Some are tighter than others. And several of the bows are on white bands, which I didn't really notice in the picture, but they are still pretty. Unfortunately my baby doesn't like the thicker bands and keeps pulling these off. She doesn't mind the thin nylon bands.",1
Was pretty good and arrived at a reasonable time,1
"I really liked the book; the banter between Katy and Richard. It had an interesting story line, even though you knew where it was going. Well written; will read more by this author.",1
seems sturdy enough though missing clips Update: Their customer service contacted me and kindly send a replacemt,1
"The grill of my car was ripped off by a large something flying down the interstate so I needed a replacement. I was afraid after reading some reviews that this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect! I own a 2013 Corolla LE. I didn't put it on myself--I had a guy at a body shop do it for me--but it looked really easy. It just snapped right on in less than 5 minutes. I gave it a 4 star for the sturdiness because it does seem pretty flimsy (time and flying debris will tell), but over all I'm very satisfied that my car no longer has a gaping maw on the front now and that the price was reasonable.",1
"Can't go wrong with these classics. I prefer Phase 10 over Uno, but both are fun.",1
So many characters brought in so quickly O couldn't keep up. This is book 11 but I haven't read the others.I loved the way they worked together and believed a child's dream.,1
"Really enjoyed the movie, specially AFTER getting past all the really dark, dreary, scary stuff at the beginning. Also the mommy issues... wtf?! DC. All the promotional stuff made me think it was finally a hero kids could watch, and within reason they can, but I do feel misled.. this is a grown up movie in a kids wrapper. Like the kid stuff was an after thought to lighten it up and broaden the audience. Again, I enjoyed the movie. I just wish it had been all fun",1
My first use I felt many loose bristles and was concerned if these were knock off brush heads. Second use and all future times there was no issue. I never had experienced loose bristles with Sonicare brush heads.,1
Bought for my granddaughter. She loves it,1
I always order a larger size because it shrinks like crazy.,1
"I like knowing it will not leave nasty glue all over my windows when I stop using the film when I finally get around to picking window treatments. I did have small air bubbles pop up around the edges when the temp went below freezing outside which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Not very noticeable, worth it for the film being easier to install and remove than the type with glue!",1
"Though the top was a tad big on me, it wasn't enough to kill the overall vibe and look of the swimsuit. The bottoms fit perfectly - which I expected. So, overall, I was pleased with the purchase. The quality is also very good - which at times with Amazon purchases, can be a hit or a miss. I am a proud customer.",1
The necklace was very nice and beautiful. We bought this for a cousin of ours that loves horses. Although it did not arrive on time. It was a day late and made us late for our cousins birthday party because we were waiting for it to arrive. I am only giving it 4 stars because it arrived late.,1
"This is a gift and it looks nice and is packaged well. The only annoying thing is a big sticker that has the price, which is less than the listed price I paid which is even more annoying.",1
Gave as a birthday gift for my best friend she loves it a lot. Utilizes a lot of drinks,1
"This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",1
Nice for little league girls,1
I love this dish but his water spout was a little bent on arrival despite good packaging.,1
"I was super happy with these snow pants when I got them until I tried them on. I am 5'4"", 115 lbs and ordered the medium and they were very small on me. The material was great and loved the zippered pockets and built-in gaiters. I wanted to exchange them for a large, but they were three times the price which is unfortunately out of my budget. If you get these and they fit, you will love them!",1
"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",1
"Way better than my previous waterproof headphones. Various earplug sizes included to find the best fit for your ears. Together with 'half moon' fitting pieces a very good and secure fit was possible. Did an open water swim for > 1 hour and they didn't come out of my ears. Overall sound quality good, but low (bass) tones could be a bit better (personal preference).",1
NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,1
Arrival of order was as predicted; Havent used it yet as i ordered it for future use.,1
Bought as a gift for my husband a couple years ago. He loved it and we’ve used it when sending holidays cards via snail mail and such.,1
"The quality is great, but the sizing is off. They run small. Also, make sure it fits loose on your male pup and that the elastic doesn’t rest directly on his privates..when it’s too tight, it hurts their privates and causes irritation, rash, bruising and scabbing. I learned the hard way. You will need to put an overnight maxi pad or something in there & wash them. I soak them in white vinegar & water before a cold water wash with free & clear detergent. Then hang dry. I bought a size Medium for my 12 lb. Toy Poodle and realized he needed a Large, so I am ordering again. I do recommend these, just go a size larger and don’t use long term.",1
"It works but I have not checked it yet for RF interference with other electronics, radios, etc.",1
"I thought this was just a Holy Grail mug, when it's actually a bunch of different quotes. Still a fun mug.",1
Met all expectations except cleaning. Cap can not be disassembled for cleaning. Size and performance was excellent,1
I like how easy it was to sit up and to use the kids love it know they can play for what that day is forever and not need to change out the battery’s just charge it and keep going and it doesn’t take long to charge either we love this about it.,1
Well made but the screws could’ve been a bit bigger for the plastic anchors.,1
I've taken these before. The Vitamins are easy to digest.,1
"It is a very simple shower head. Installation took 5 minutes. No leaks but water continues to drip for a long time after shutting off the shower. The movement of the shower holder is a little limited, which makes it more difficult to use in a small shower stall. The all metal design is appealing but the actual product is a little on the small side compared to other shower heads with plastic.",1
"Great front bumper,little more than what I wanted to pay for a bumper. I wished it had more of a gloss black finish to match the new rear steel bumper from EAG that I had put on the rear. Also putting the fog lights in the bumper was VERY hard.",1
"Changes color after long use, other than that it's great",1
The color is closest to the pink that I wanted to match the pink shoes I'd bought. The blouse is nice & fits well enough.,1
I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don’t slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn’t have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn’t caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while.,1
Okay for price. Smaller than I thought.,1
Like the product . Easy to apply. I have tried the others and nothing works as maybelline works for me.,1
Worked perfectly. Does the job for a night or evening out. Very well supported. Adhesive/gel loosens after a few hours. The cups did seem a little small,1
Nice looking glasses. I bought them for my father in-law. But they were too wide for his face. I wish they would have been smaller (narrower from side edge to side edge).,1
"Some pens have a trouble with the ballpoint and “run out”... they don’t really bleed through and when they work, the colors are stunning and vibrant for good note taking.",1
These leggings are super soft and true to size I host a big xmas eve so this is the perfect holiday cheer outfit while still remaining comfy while hosting amd cooking,1
Excellent price and decent quality. 👍,1
"So far so good, fits well, easy to connect! Just hope it holds up, will update review. I switched to leather because the orginal band gave me a rash :(",1
Works great as long as you don’t sweat too much and aren’t in any humidity. The advice about the plastic wrap on your wrist really worked though! Product fit snug and lined up good with my watch.,1
"Looks great, goes on and fits really nicely, as well as adds really good grip. Only thing I don't like is the buttons get pretty stiff once you put it on.",1
I had to cut away some plastic pieces before I could use it with my weed whacker.,1
"It’s cute, not so comfortable inside but was to fun to wear it in the movie feather.",1
Really cute but runs a bit small,1
Nice durable cover for someone prone to spills. Worth the price.,1
I would to give them a 5 star. The balloons looks great but some of the balloons have small holes and this cause me to over work.,1
"It's been a long time since I've read a good shifter fated mate book. I really liked this novel. I just wish we had more time with the couple after the full moon, to show that the sparks between them continued.",1
I love these pads but they don't always break up in the wash you need to put them in first,1
"Have not used the item yet, but price great and worth trying. Delivery is what is so great! Ordered one night and arrived the next evening! Fantastic!",1
"The adapter does what it's supposed to and is a nice size. Doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Biggest drawback is that when the adapter is plugged into the computer, it covers up the other USBC port making it impossible to charge the computer and use the adaptor at the same time. If you intend to use this adaptor to quickly transfer files back and forth then it's no big deal, but if you want to use it to back up your device, or edit files on a hard drive (something that you can't easily unplug w/o losing access to the files) then you should splurge the extra 5 bucks for one with a cord. Otherwise, you can't beat the price",1
Noticeable difference in my nails with regular use. Good product! Highly recommended,1
"Other than the buttons/holes are on the female side and it is a bit small for size large, it works.",1
Was a good replacement for the original Fitbit band the broke.,1
It is really very small. But it works,1
I just started using the product so not sure how it will work. I have put it in my shampoo and it smells good.,1
takes some getting used to.,1
The stories are very well-written and very scary.,1
"The clasp edges are a bit jagged so should not used with fine materials, which is what I needed it for. I had to be very careful in order to use.",1
"I really liked my purchase, I think it's a bit difficult to connect to wifi display from my laptop.",1
"This table is what I expected. The reason I can't give a five star is due to the legs being uneven, slightly and some of the holes for the bolts are a bit misaligned.",1
"I love the feel of these pants. They are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I only wish they made them in a petite length. I’m 5’2” and 140 lbs at 6 months pregnant. The length of the pants are probably about 3 inches longer than what I need. I’ll deal with it because they’re so comfortable, but would give 5 stars if they came in petite.",1
"Super fast shipping. Easy to follow instructions. I barely got it growing and my cat was on it like white on rice. Only Gave it 4 stars because it didnt have quite enough potting soil in the container, i had to use a couple tablespoons to cover all the seeds. They send plenty of seeds. It grows super fast, but I may need to keep my cat away from it for a few days, because she chews it down to the nubs, and it needs to regrow.",1
Great pieces of jewelry for the price. The 6mm is perfect for my tragus piercing. I gave four stars because I already lost one because it fell out! Other than that I am very happy with the purchase!,1
"Good cost/value ratio...this is a LARGE bag of marshmallows! Would make a great snack for a bridal or baby shower. Package arrived very fresh. Only problem I had with this item was although they were quite tasty, they are just plain marshmallow flavor...I detected no trace of any strawberry flavoring as advertised.",1
I like these earbuds a lot! I bought these about 6 or 7 months ago and they still work great today! With the thick cord it does not tangle that much. The sound quality is phenomenal! If you are a fan of loud music I would definitely recommend these.,1
"Perform very well, no rust after 4 weeks. Does not have the 2 threaded holes to aid removal as OEM Rotors did. Fit over center hub has more clearance than OEM so removal should not be an issue years from now. Applied thin coat of never-sieze to mating area.",1
"If you lost the one that came with the machine like I did, than this will be the replacement part you are looking for",1
"don't win often, hard to save enough.",1
Nice intro to taxes which for many are mystifying... definitely allows the reader understand more but without overload. Not as detailed as I’d prefer but a great intro to the topic .. well done,1
"Well, Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition. Very nice packaging makes this perfect for gift wrapping and giving as present. It also come with a nice storage bag and glass case along with a lens cloth. These are plastic lenses...so use the protective cases or they will scratch just like any other plastic lens. These are of the blue blocker variety and they work! Nicely styled with lightweight aluminium alloy frames and comfortable nose pads. I plan to use them for shooting at the range, as well as for night driving. Good bang for the buck...if you protect them. There you have it.",1
It picked up an hour long conversation between two people speaking with normal inside voices while concealed in a bag in a average sized room Could make out 98% of what was said.,1
Love these but how do you dim them?,1
"I’ve only used a couple of them, but they seem to be a little lower quality than I’m used to. They also come in a flimsy cardboard box that won’t last long as a storage container. Decent product, but nothing special.",1
"Works great, holds well but the key gets jammed a lot.",1
Has a pretty good flavor to be tobacco free,1
"taste is great, but these are bit too chewy for me..have had them before, just dont recall them ever being so thick n chewy..mite just be this flavor?",1
I wee disappointed when the book ended so abruptly. I am looking forward to the next book in this series.,1
These arrived healthy and green I attached them to rock and they took off beautiful Thanks seller,1
i liked the way it works jar top spin off with ease,1
"I liked that the leads were human enough to be wrong, yet strong enough to admit it. Character driven, fast paced, good story, and consistent. A very good read.",1
Hopefully this will help with my health issues as I've read lots of good things about manuka honey.,1
"i use this for enjoyment, im a grown man who likes toys, what can i say",1
"Honestly, Initially, I had a challenge but believe it was more Amazon than XFasten. Though they did nothing other than fill the order from Amazon, they as a company took the action to ensure the problem was rectified and that I was happy. The tape is no longer relevant... any company that conducts business like this is a company to do business with.",1
Super Cute and very quiet!!!!!,1
Looked great and very solid....held up to my southern-in-laws' dense potato salad.,1
"Works well, no bricking",1
Slightly lightweight but otherwise perfect item. I do wish it had a weighted base cell when you are pulling out toilet paper that stuck can won't wobble around.,1
"Bought two of these for international travel and have not been disappointed in the slightest. I'm currently sitting in a hotel room charging a Surface Pro 6 using the PD port and an adapter, plus an iPhone Xs Max from the QC 3.0 port, plus an iPhone 8 from one of the regular USB ports, and it's handling all three with no issue whatsoever. (It's pretty warm, I probably wouldn't leave the room with all that stuff plugged in, but if you're in the room anyway, it's no issue at all.)",1
Exactly what you need to cut & strip fresh herbs and leafy greens. Easy to use and clean. Great safety tab that allows you to retract blades. Super easy to clean. Much better quality than others I’ve used & broken. Plastic could be a tad thicker to make it last longer - but at this price it can’t be beat that’s my only quasi-complaint. Still ranks as one of the best I’ve found after purchasing & breaking 2 other brands previous to this.,1
"Love these lights. Lots of fun. We wore them when we went wine tasting before Christmas, and got raves. All I heard all day was, where did you get them? The only complaint is some of the bulbs were messed up. Not clear. Looked like glue was all over them.",1
"My 97 year-old Dad could not use any phone but this one. His vision does not allow him to see the numbers on the buttons, so my daughter made up a large print chart with names that correspond to the buttons. It was easy to program and set up. It is so easy for him to lift the receiver and press one button to reach me. The only problem is that others, such as the aides at his assisted living facility, do not understand how to use it when it is on one-button program mode. I would have liked the amplified audio to be even louder, but that is mostly a problem because my father won't wear his hearing aids. This really helped solve a big problem for us, and I would buy it again, for sure.",1
"I prefer the older model which is turned on by the pressure from the tire, rather than a button you have to press. It always seems to turn off automatically just before I'm ready to take the pressure on the next tire.",1
They work but are thin. I wasn't surprised given the price.,1
It was very nice! Niece enjoyed it very much! The heart in the wand popped out after dropping once but everything else was fine!,1
"I am sure I would have really appreciated this tool, however this will not work with a 2002 Camry and the other years that have the same tie rods. Hope this helps anyone wondering.",1
Looks great. Just make sure you are really close to your waist size,1
"Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters. It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times",1
I bought it for my boyfriend. He likes it. It does a good job moisturizing the hair but not as good as I hoped with the skin under his beard. Neutral smell.,1
FASt shipping!!!!!!!!!,1
I like the product. It is what I expected. I ordered a black can. I got grey.,1
"Cute dress, it's a cotton fabric, so prone to lightening in color with washing. I got a large and it fits well (US size 12).",1
Great fabric. Soft and washed well. It’s a little thin so a onsie would be needed in cold month.,1
"I might've been happier if my guaranteed set wasn't hot pink, but overall it is what I expected: some weird color combos (lots of half/half and speckles), a few really excellent dice, several D6 with pips instead of numbers, and a few factory seconds that are chipped along the edges or have paint issues. I'm going to end up repainting the excessively ugly dice that were included, but overall definitely worth the cost and the fun of opening up the bag and seeing what you got.",1
"I like the hair however I don't love the ends plus the hair had smell (so had to wash before installation), and it's a bit itching. But otherwise it looks great, I did the individual crochet braid method. I only used 5 and 1/2 packs.",1
"This was a gift and the recipient has not used it yet, but it looks like it will do the job.",1
"Looks real, sturdy and buttons press down. No sound & screen as is, but my daughter uses her imagination & loves this phone.",1
"The black and green files seem to gunk up pretty quick, so not sure how long they'll last. Foam may be too soft? Buffing side kept catching the edge of my nails",1
Great price. Glad I purchased.,1
"Good fit. Had about a year now. Pull into garage in winter. Holding up so far, but the material does not seem like top of the line. So 4 stars. It's ok.",1
We like the rack. There were some sharp pointed wires that needed to be cut before installing it.,1
I'm not fond if the textured backdrops. Otherwise it works ok and for the price it's ok but a smooth surface would be better.,1
"The paint spreads as it dries, keeping that in mind the smaller the design the better. We enjoyed the window cling option for the paint a few did not stick for some reason. In concept this kits seems like such a great idea, but thinking about the cost, time to dry, and how the paint spreads which can effect design, I wish it was priced cheaper. I say 3 stars but gave it one extra because at the end of the day it was a fun activity that we all got to do together as a family. Making memories that will last longer then the ornaments.",1
"Great product, one of he flowers did fall off",1
Not bad for the price,1
My husband & I love this cup but I ordered the red / blue set. When they arrived it was red / black set. So we were a little disappointed. But overall we love this shaker cup & would definitely buy it again!!,1
"We bought the crib from Buy Buy Baby without the bed side rails about 6 years ago. Glad to see the rails were still available. Very easy to convert, once I got the crib apart. The foot board doesn't feel super stable, but our kids have jumped on the bed and it's held fine. Now we just need our 3 year old to use *this* bed instead of *our* bed.",1
"Fun read, great lead characters. Story got a bit repetitive about 75% in but got better again.",1
"It works great, but lots of water comes out. Would be nice if that could be adjusted.",1
Good holder all around. Only thing I didn't love was the Plastic Clip seems cheap.,1
Definitely works for a smaller scale yard. I do wish it came with more nozzles.,1
Material is cheaper than expected but ok for a crib skirt.,1
"Well made, very durable. Would get five stars if it had some padding on shoulder straps.",1
"No issues with the cartridges, works just like the originals, but substantially less money. Recommend.",1
"The product looks as expected, the only downside is it’s flat. The picture makes it seem that hat had more depth. Meaning it more poking out you have to actually pull out Piece on the hat.",1
"Whiplash. Product is comfortable, easy to wear.",1
"I’m 5’8, 150lbs, 34D, and bought a M. This almost worked! The suit is great quality, but the boob area (the strap connecting the top across the boobs) isn’t quite right for me. If you’re on the fence and don’t mind possible returns, buy it and test it out.",1
A good protection glass. It worked for about 2 years. Then the glass started cracking around the home button. I wrote the company to sent me a replacement and they did. I'm happy with their customer service!,1
"The best suspenders I've had so far. Sometimes the left side does not hold properly, but in general, they are still the best.",1
"I don't know what the 1.25"" dremel diamond wheel can do compared to these smaller wheels, but three of them cut through 2 feet of 1/2"" thick porcelain tile, which comparatively, is $3 worth of material as opposed to $25 for one dremel wheel.",1
Good price and quality. Delivered as promised in two days.,1
Sound quality and connectivity is great. I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 for battery life. Other than that I love it.,1
"I like my rock, but it doesn't have any tabs or holes to use the two provided anchors. I will drill my own, but feel others should know,",1
The small usb is incredibly hard to plug in. Too tight and have to wiggle it on. Could be the pc since it’s my only usb-c i can test it on. Works when plugged in. Recognized right away. Very sturdy and solid casing.,1
I really like the product but the wrong color was delivered. I got a green one and ordered the rose gold.,1
"Nice dress. Needed a size larger, but wearable.",1
Somewhat small. but good material.,1
Decent rack for th e price - my only complaint is has a bolt instead of hitch pin on receiver. Bought a standard hitch pin - but too big for rack. is is safe to drill out holes to accommodate the pin?,1
"I find this product to be light weight & has strong sewing stitches. It seemed well made and sturdy. My son, 21 yrs old, likes it a lot. His only concern are the clips that came with this product. My sons said, ‘ not so confident to hold his 210lbs body frame. Over all, he likes it & stated he would not hesitate to give this product a ‘ solid Four Stars!",1
"This can be dressed up or down, very versatile. Only downfall is the chain is too long for my wrist and gets in the way when driving.",1
"I am a 70 year old woman and put this together in about 15 - 20 minutes. We have two other bed frames like this one and they are both heavier duty than this one. That being said, this one is sturdy enough and solid when we use it. Would give 5 stars if it was not bolted together. Our others just unfolded out of the carton with no wrench needed. Welded is better, but this one is strong and solid so far. Price mattered on this purchase and it is excellent value for the money.",1
The lock was very easy to install. I would give it 5 stars if 1) it didn't take as long to recognize your home and connect/unlock the door and 2) the apps auto-unlock zone wasn't so large as when leaving my town i travel on a road that's back in range after i leave the house so it wants to unlock the door again.,1
So my Apple Watch band came today and I must say I’m very impressed with the product I had no problems tanking my old bands off it was very easy to put on the only problem I’m having is that some of the glitter is falling off the band but over all I like itb,1
I use Streamlight flashlights at work everyday as a professional aircraft mechanic on night shift. I bought this because of brand name but not for my job. This is strictly the well made Home use variety of head lamp. These type of LEDs cast wide light not focused beam. The 3 brightness is handy for everything from night light reading a book in hospital room with sick relative to full bright for under the hood work in the garage or crawling underneath car.,1
"So far, so good. One time it stopped charging my phone after plugging in the audio, but I just had to disconnect and reconnect the device, then all worked together.",1
I love this ring. It is beautiful. The only downside is it is very easy to knock off one of the stones. I lost the red stone the first day I wore it. I still wear the ring and still get compliments on it.,1
"Okay, to be fair I am a monkey when it comes to things like this and it is why I ordered a two pack. The first one was practice! I made it work on try two, so people with better skills than I should be just fine with the product. I penalized the product one star as I saw one at the phone store with a jig for aligning the protection screen. It would probably only take me one if I had one less thing to worry about! All in all happy with the price and it works well.",1
"Before purchasing and after receipt, I watched the video which was very helpful for setup. The stand is well made and all went together as per video. I have some difficulty in setting my phone on the stand. Not a case issue … the setting of the lightning cable seems a bit off straight. The support for the phone is adjustable to accommodate for different case thicknesses … it is the slight misalignment of the cable that seems the issue. I have set and reset. Not a deal breaker, just takes a bit of finagling to set the phone. All else works well. The only other ""issue"" is … there are still 3 cables out the back of the unit. Three white cables. I bought a black unit. I'm trying another stand and am on the lookout for a cable wrangler - probably a solvable problem. If nothing else, I can wrap the cables in black electric tape. Honestly, there does not seem to be 1 perfect solution, but what I really like about this stand is how it holds the watch.",1
The sound is more crisp then the less expensive version. I hope they last...,1
"It came right on time, looks fantastic. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price a little to high but it supposed to be handmade so it balances it off.",1
It is as it looks. Good quality metal. But not cheap,1
Has some small pebbles in it but it’s not made for consumption so I figured may have some in it.,1
"I always order these and love them. Haven't worn these yet, but know they will fit. They always have.",1
"Works and is pretty cheap. Had issues with ones before. The picture is not what you get though, you get a newer version.",1
Work great but get a little warm!,1
I like the product very much. But the pump on the bottle never worked. I’ve had to unscrew the top every time I used it.,1
I think it work good. I could tell the difference before and after application.,1
My sister has the real discontinued one... this one smells very similar but not as strong of a scent,1
I like these a lot. If I could change anything about the product I would rather the edges to be over edged. Other than that I would order again.,1
It’s a nice product to keep around the house when you want a quick and easy snack. I enjoyed this very much and it is the right size bag and stays good windshield for a couple days. Would re-by in a second.,1
I like it the only thing is I think it. Would have been better if it was in book four.,1
"Doesn't really work well on certain ants, but it arrived quickly and works overall.",1
should come with the glue to hold it in place,1
This sheet was just what I was looking for. I found the elastic unnecessary for my use and cut it off on one corner. Fits perfectly on my pillow top mattress.,1
I enjoyed this book and plan to read it to our 2nd grade class.,1
The air filter keeps sliding off the band is not wide enough to hold it on.,1
"Marker runs out quickly, wish you could buy replacement markers",1
"I do like this product a lot. I set the 7 programs daily for my pool pump in Florida, where during the summer the pump has to run 8 hours each day to prevent algae growth. With this timer I can run the pump with intervals during the 24 hours of each day, such that the pool water is never sitting still for long times. I took off one star, because it was hard to cut the holes to the right size for the electrical connections. One of the pre-marked holes broke off to a bigger size than I needed.",1
They seem fine so far,1
Bought as a gift and it was a big hit. I do kind of wish the cats hands were slightly bigger.,1
This book was hard to put down. Fast paced and action packed. A book to enjoy.,1
"Sandals are cute, I was expecting a richer color, but they are still cute(Olive Green). They are true to size. I wear a 10, and ordered my size, the width is goid as well. Delivery was fast. My only complaint is the shoe does rub against the top of my foot, by the buckle. I'm sure I will have to put a bandaid there, to keep from getting a blister, but I am going to keep them",1
"The cover and shams look as pictured. Very soft and comfortable. Its very delicate, I tore a hole by the zipper very easily. I did not return cover because it was super cheap.",1
"Love these. The lamps are so GREAT. They come in different sizes. I have one in my children's room and it give the softest soothing light. I have the other in the kitchen, which really makes it seem calm and relaxing in our home when it's the only or one of the only lights on any time of day. The candle holders are a different story. One of them is cut to hold a tea light and the other is cut too small so I actually can't do anything with it.",1
Discreet and cute! Purrrfect little travel companion. It is a little more powerful than expected! Lots of different speed/ massage patterns. The charge lasts a long time! I like that it had a soft texture and I'd waterproof!,1
"Wish the picture was brighter. Doesn't matter how sunny it is out, the picture looks dark. Also the mirror wiggles and bounces around some, but not terrible.",1
I used this while attending a music festival a few months ago. It worked great! No seats? No problem! No standing for hours with this cane!,1
I love Soda product! These ran a little small for me! Wish they worked because I really liked them!,1
Very nice color. Good quality the price we paid for.,1
pointy but satisfying,1
The quality was not a strong as I thought. My phone did get hot when charging. But it shuts off when reacts 100%,1
"Super cute but a little long, they don't stay in place and I have to constantly adjust them probably due to the length of them. They are very lovely however and I j\hope to be able to adjust them to fit.",1
These are great for blocking out light but they are plastic tracks and are not going to look like professional blind tracks. You get what you pay for. They were definitely easy to install and serve their purpose.,1
These fit almost perfectly in the bottom of the NuWave oven.,1
"This smells and cleans like windex, only it comes in a form of foam. Yes no doubt it cleans well, but I cannot say it’s something special.",1
"My grand daughter loved these boots. She put them on and would not take them off. They are really cute and must be comfortable for her. The price I paid was too expensive for a child's house shoes, She will grow out of them before I get my money's worth. Four stars only because of the price.",1
Works as advertised. Very satisfied.,1
You ran out of black in my size,1
Loved the product but it didn ‘t fit the chair and it was returned for refund.,1
"I had to replace my Klipsch sound bar. That one had decent sound but too many quirks and irritations so it had to go. This Yamaha sound bar has great sound. My father in law doesn't hear so good and he can hear the voices without shaking the house. Movies and football games come through great with full rich sound. A huge upgrade from regular tv speakers, it's easily as good as my more expensive prior sound bar. Setup was a breeze as was doing the update with a sub drive. I definitely recommend taking the time to do the update, it's easy and made a big difference. If you can't afford to drop the cash on a full surround system this is awfully good for just a sound bar and sub.",1
"Based on the reviews and the seller’s advice, I sized up to a M when I normally wear an XS/S. Unfortunately, the stitching on the shoulder of the M far surpasses my petite, narrow shoulders, so it sticks waaaay out and makes me look like a football player. When I bunched the material to fit my shoulder, it looked perfect. Therefore, even though this one didn’t work for me, I think it’ll be great when I return it for my true size. Not sure why everyone says to size up, as there is a plenty of extra material... It’s made to be a baggy crop top. Unless you have extra broad shoulders, just order your real size so that it’s a baggy crop top that properly fits and looks good.",1
Dawson gives strong evidence for how our thoughts shapes our reality and influences everyone around us. And he offers more online information at the end of each chapter. I do wish that he included more guidance about his meditations in the book.,1
"Good value and well made, it did not come with a front screen protector.",1
"Loved the color, price and fast shipping. I have only worn them in the yard and around the house to see if they would rub. They have not.",1
The shoe is excellent for trail running but runs half a size to small,1
I wear glasses for daily vision. I cannot wear this headband with my glasses. Otherwise it works quite well.,1
This is a beautiful good quality nice bangle! but for my small wrist it won't stay in one place it will definitely fits for someone who has a medium sized wrist. So I'll keep this nice gift to give to my family who can use it.,1
"These socks have good compression, but I'm not a huge fan of how itchy they are. I understand they need to have the tightness, which cotton can't do, but I really hoped they would be a bit softer. I got them for my varicose veins, especially a problem one on my left leg, which they do what I need them for.",1
"it looks good and gives a nice style, however i thought the butterflies are bigger than the real product, it's a bit smaller than pictures.",1
Consistently received about 25 channels on each of the televisions in my home with this antenna. The UHF channels seemed to come in clearer in my area. Great picture. Looking forward to free tv.,1
I got the Phone system on time and in good shape. It was what I ordered and in good shape.,1
Well this is not really a review. I purchased these batteries trusting the reviews already left for these batteries. I am very impressed with the cases that come with the batteries. The cases come with a rubber seal beneath the covers. So far so good 👍,1
"Just wished it was a lil more snug, I got a medium cuz I'm a size 9 1/2",1
I was leery due to the last book dragging but this book is an exciting read! Love the story! My only complaint is I enjoy when Anita fully bonds with a new lover. Those bonds are what have kept me reading. I'll probably still buy the next book.,1
my baby did came with a missing face plate but is still a very cool pop,1
"SUPER cute, design was just as pictured. Thin, you can see the print on the other side but not a deal breaker since its SO cute!",1
"I do love these chair socks. They match the color of our dining chairs. But they don’t always stay put. I’ve found if you have a chair (or two) that is used more frequently, being pulled in and out from under the table, they weaken the material and slide off the leg. I still continue to use the socks because they are keeping my hardwood floors from scratching but I wish they would have a bit more elastic in them to stay put on the legs.",1
"I was looking for a watch that can do fitness tracking and give notifications from cell phone, monitoring heart rate, alarm but don't want to spend too much money and I found this great watch. it's comfortable to wear all day long. Battery last for days. I give this review a 4 stars because the actual screen is smaller than it looks.",1
These have been good sheets. Haven't seen any issues with them so far.,1
Great tank! I give it 4 stars only because there is a logo at the hem so it can only be worn with certain tops or as athleisure wear. Fabric and fit are great.,1
made a pie...all loved it...,1
"I like the color, but wish there was more coverage. I have a full size car and the base does not cover all of the seats. And I like the pockets at the base of cover a lot.",1
I just received the pills and you already want a review of how they work. Let me use them and I will come back and update my review.,1
Writing is too small to read otherwise a beautiful puzzle.,1
"This is a great hose and it fits my needs perfectly. Unfortunately the nozzle will come off somewhat frequently, though it is easy to screw/pop back on.",1
"It’s thin enough where my son doesn’t automatically slide down in his crib and it doesn’t make him tall enough to try to climb out, which was a worry with thicker wedges. I’m not sure if it’s making a difference reflux wise yet because he’s been getting colds and stomach bugs a lot, so I didn’t give it five stars. He does seem to be waking and coughing less in in sleep compared to before, but I can’t attribute it to the wedge just yet.",1
"Self-taught is the limit of my desire to play guitar. I want to pick it up and string out few clean notes/tunes, not be some virtuoso guitar god. This got me past the hump of plucking along with YouTube videos and gave me a method of playing and a system that ""scored"" my results as getting better and where I needed work. The game lets you move around and work on the skills you are interested in. The cable is top notch and I'm really happy with this game.",1
Great unit.. led are really bring... Outlet are all working..,1
It fits as a true medium,1
"It came pretty fast. Much fast then they said it would come. But it did however look very cheap. But the person I gave it to, still liked it!",1
"I bought this a couple months ago to be prepared for the summer, and when I went to use it this week it doesn’t work! I have tried both batteries and neither seem to charge. It turned on one time for about 5 minutes and nothing since. What a disappointment! Do not buy, it’s a waste of money! Update: shortly after reading my review the company reached out to me and sent me TWO replacements that have been working great! I greatly appreciate them replacing it free of charge!",1
Yes it's big but it makes it easier to use,1
"nice ointment, a bit runny but moisturizes well. There just a few ingredients and they are all natural. no preservatives. I recommend this product!",1
"Quality isn't top notch, but the long life of the ink and cost is good.",1
"The GO was actually super awkward to use before I got the case. Now I just flip it open and the floppy keyboard is stable on my lap, I can just use the computer without fiddling with setup so the keyboard didn't fall off the tablet. It's so much better I don't know why it doesn't come with a sturdy case from Microsoft.",1
Just what we needed for our banquet.,1
"Dear Santa: Children’s Christmas Letters and Wish Lists, 1870 – 1920 by Chronicle Books What I like about this book are many things. Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about. love that they show color photos of a scene during the book. So much history: how the Santa letter came about over the years, the origins of Santa. Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children, living history section and a don't miss area before it gets into the letters. Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60's remember. So many fond memories over the years, what a treasure this book is.",1
Bought it to put in the cabinet to store my platters. Works perfectly for that purpose,1
Was not as “tall” as expected. But it looks great. Very sticky.,1
"The item arrived as advertised except for the small dent. Would give 5 stars, but...the dent.",1
"The bar was too short for my liking, but the colors are so fun & bright I just got a longer bar & they were better (:",1
These are really cute. Fit my 1 year olds head and she will even leave it on for a few minutes! I was disappointed that the blue color is actually more of a dark teal and the red color is actually more of a burnt orange. I'm having a hard time matching these to her clothing.,1
I didn't really like the rough texture of the mesh against my feet but the sole is comfortable and it's a good water shoe.,1
Soft and nice. Fits perfectly.,1
It was very over priced.,1
"How to go over the directions a couple of times but once done , easy , Best to shake them off outside after cutting. ! They will shed. Multi",1
"Worked really well for my son, just okay for me. Definitely made our feet softer.",1
Fits and works in the bathroom fan housing it is supposed to fit in. Good deal.,1
I do love these but we returned them because they are too narrow for my daughters foot.,1
I like the price the most,1
Love the shirt. I wish the fabric of the shirt was softer.... a little rough. Overall good shirt,1
It’s more red than shown. Color is not true to picture. This is a very cherry wood.,1
"The problem is any missing instructions what to do with the product after arrival. It smells horribly, it colours all water yellow. From web I found that I should soak it for a long time (in my case I soaked it for 3 days replacing water several times). This removes significant amount of colouring and smell. Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",1
Cute and can change colors with outfits. Gave 4 stars because they tend to loosen up after wearing a while.,1
Nice Thai Cashew Curry with the hot curry and vegetables. Quick meal if you add your own rice. Microwave in a minute.,1
"Bought for my arthritic grandma. She likes it just fine, but I regret not buying the multi-band, multi-handle pack.",1
I generate monthly billings for several companies and the double window does save time in processing.,1
I just had surgery on my shoulder AND my foot. This package could not be more perfect. I've been able to increase my range of motion and mobility in my arm because I can do the exercises at home and not just twice a week with the physical therapist. I plan on using these when I get back into the gym too.,1
Pretty design. Looks great on rose gold phone! I’ve dropped my phone several times and it’s held up well.,1
Exactly as advertised. Shipped accordingly and fit perfectly. Great item.,1
They we're quick to install and felt like they were of quality the ones for the Elite controller are a more high grade but these work just fine for adapting a controller for a smaller trigger pull,1
"Bought this for my wife and she likes it. So far, it has held up well but then she does not use her cell phone like I do.",1
"I think these are about 1/2 inch too short to be very comfortable in my fairly large hands, but the surfaces are nice as are the fittings.",1
"The brush works fine for dishes, and for cleaning cast iron cookware. The bristles will take whatever form they were last dried in, so should be reformed after each use to avoid having the brush go flat. I have used other brushes which better retain their form.",1
So far everything is working.,1
"We ordered this set for our Switch because it was a good balance between the price of wired controllers (cheap) and functionality of wireless. Overall the controller works great - good ergonomics, buttons are satisfying, sticks are usable, gyro seems to work, low latency. My only complaints : 1) the rumble is really, really extreme. So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions. Would definitely recommend if you need a couple extra controllers for when friends come over. For a daily driver or to be more pro, some of the more expensive options might be better.",1
"Worked well, i have to increase the volume a bit, but quality is fair and works. I used it on my 2008 4runner",1
I use this for bedtime. It helps everyone sleep better.,1
"the purple in particular makes an excellent blush, but it goes on much lighter than I wanted it too even if you sit there packing it in for a long time. I use a white NYX eye primer so it goes on VERY pastel and hold up pretty well, I haven't tried getting it wet yet but that may make for thicker application.",1
These are great quality! The only Issue is that my daughter has wide feet so the elastic on top was hurting her a bit. I love these but they didn't work out for her. If your toddler has wide feet I would go a different route. But aside from that the canvas material was really comfortable for her and they looked adorable.,1
"Very good spatula, it gets the job done. There is/was a slight wobble in handle, so the tolerance in the connection of the wooden handle to the metal body could stand to be tightened. Other than that, fantastic spatula.",1
"Easy setup with bluetooth to your phone, and clear instructions provided. This is my second time buying this product, my first one had the USB cable snap off at the Y with almost a year of constant use, could have been my fault due to heavy use. Only complaint is that it is slightly quieter than max volume with a regular aux cord.",1
Shipped fast. Great product,1
The flavor was great.,1
My 2-year old grandson loves this series. Pictures are great; nice sturdy board book that is easy for him to use. He asks for this book to be read over and over.,1
"No taboo here, just a May -October romance. And what a romance! So well written, you could just feel how close these two friends are. I have to admit it made me a pile of mush.",1
This replacement band is perfect. Great quality and durable. Excellent price and customer service!,1
"Best purchase I have ever made!!! This mirror is amazing! I highly recommend this product super sturdy, lighting is perfect, super cute and easy to use! I’m recommending this to all my co workers! I’m honestly thinking about buying a second one for myself and a couple for Christmas gifts (:",1
Comfortable and worth the purchase,1
"This is definitely the shampoo the Stars use. My hair is never smelt better or felt softer in my entire life. I felt like a model walking down the street with my hair bouncing and blowing in the wind. I highly recommend this product. I did not use it for a drug test, I just wanted to see if it would clean out the impurities from my hair which it seems to have done.",1
Whirpool washer is much better now. These things are a little tricky to install - you need two people.,1
Dog loves it and I am confident that she will not run around in the car,1
"It’s a great book, talks about things we take for granted when we’re buying a house, or getting a new job. It gives great advices, I have recommended this book to a handful of people. It’s easy to read short and they go straight to the point. Loved it!",1
So far so good. They fit my daughter just right and look very nice.,1
Very handy to have around,1
These are perfect paper Coffee cups! I love the sleek white design! It is also the perfect size for great coffee on top!,1
Quick delivery and interesting how the bugs glow with this,1
"I absolutely love the color of this fountain pen! My fountain ink refills fit perfectly in the pen. My only complaint is that the pen seems to leak at times, running the risk of ruining clothing and getting all over my hands.",1
Super cute. Got here fast.,1
I like the size and the grey color. It is a replacement for an old stool just like this that was just too trashed looking to keep in my new laundry room :),1
"Love these lamps! They have a small foot print on my night stand, the charger works good, they take standard size bulbs, and the design is classy and simple, we bought 2 for or bedroom.",1
"I have taken this on a weeks vacation and so far I love it! The hardware seems sturdy and the material feels like good quality. Lots of space and feels well-supported as a backpack. I'm a female, 5' 7"", and was a little worried it would swallow me but it's been great. Taking it to Iceland in a few months, and I think it will be perfect. Update: carried only this bag for a week in Iceland in January, still going strong!",1
A good purchase. The length and style of this necklace are all ok to me. I like the sterling silver things and the big reason to buy is that I really like its beautiful pendant.,1
"At first, when I opened the package, I was shocked as to how long one of the pairs was. (I had purchased two different ones). The length was not a problem - and in fact complimented my face and accented my neck. I love how light they are. I hope to purchase more!",1
"This tool is relatively inexpensive compared to other brands, but it gets the job done without any issues, make sure to keep the treads properly lubricated while using this tool to protect the treads and for longevity. Recommended to anyone looking for a decent quality tool to remove and install wheel bearings in your ride. Used on a 2006 HD Night Train.",1
"Exactly as they show in the pictures! They run big, you should consider ordering half or one size less.",1
"This series has super wide-angle lens, macro lens, fisheye lens, zoom lens, whether it is a wide panorama in the tour, or shooting tiny animals without problems. There is also a protective box that can be hand-held, and it is light and easy to go to photography at any time.",1
Bought this for my grandson,1
my 5 pound maltipoo loves it very comfortable!!!,1
Love the flavor and the energy i get after drinking this :),1
"It's study and lightweight. Perfect for taking my projects on vacation and keeping everything organized, which is why I bought it. The storage on top is a little awkward for my longer needles, with the diagonal zipper, but all in all I have no complaints. My project was small and I was able to fit more yarn in the back storage pocket for additional projects/needles. The carrying handle is thin, but sturdy and does the job.",1
I absolutely love this mask! Snorkeled in Mexico and everything was so clear! No fogging at all! I read a lot of reviews and researched other masks first before buying this one. This mask gives a realistic panoramic view and I felt so much more comfortable breathing normally rather than traditional snorkel. Just do it.,1
"It is very sensitive when measuring, small and portable, convenient to use when going out, of good quality, and very sanitary to use, without worrying about the risk of unclean and contact with bacteria.Data is also relatively accurate, a good helper in the kitchen, it is worth buying.",1
The whole shoes are fluffy. The texture of the fabric is soft. It feels so comfortable. It is especially warm. The size is just right. I really like it~~~!!!,1
"Got this for a coworker - bright colors, good quality, and she started using it immediately!",1
"Outstanding, exceed my expectations!",1
I bought these for under dresses and they are perfect for that. I did size up to a large instead of a medium because they run small. They hit the knees on me but that’s because I’m 4’11”,1
"Works very well, easy install",1
I absolutely love it. It's TRUE to size. I wear a 12 and purchased a LG. Perfect fit,1
"Easy to use, quick and mostly painless!",1
"This pan is amazing. I love the size and the nonstick coating. The lid sits nicely. It is perfect for so many things. We love it for a breakfast skillet and mix hashbrowns, eggs, onions, green peppers and bacon or ham for a one skillet breakfast. Clean up is a cinch.",1
"Excellent workmanship, beautiful appearance, and just the right size, installation is simple, special and stable. It can put a lot of things such as the usual utensils, dishes, and cups however, the biggest advantage is that it can save space.",1
"Everything I been looking for in a washcloth. Not to light perfect weight, the size is perfect and the durability is wonderful. They feel so soft after being washed the first time. Will definitely be buying again for sure.",1
"Essential reading for those who want to learn how to best contribute to redirecting the trajectory of humanity. These lessons should be taught to every educator, government official, CEO, college student, and ambitious teenager.",1
Perfect fit and very handy.,1
Good Quality and compact.,1
I bought these sheets because i was looking for a brand new clean pair of sheets that where definitely cheap but good quality and i have found them they are the best sheets white just always looks so clean and i could say i can impress females because they are so easy to wash and how i said soft. i have had my pair of sheets for a little over 3 months and no regrets i love the sheets they have been washed more then 10 times already and still like brand new as i wash them more and more the softer they get i recommend the sheets to everyone besides the price is unbeatable they are phenomenal. i am about to purchase about 3 more pair of sheets for the guest room and for my roommate,1
I first tried this in a one time use packet I got from Walmart and I was hooked. It makes my hair super soft and I recommend it to all my friends. I use it 2 times a week after I use my castor oil. Definitely notice my hair shiner. 👍👍👍,1
The shirt is well designed and fits well. The color is really good,1
Exactly what I expected!,1
"I found these diapers after another diaper I bought leaked all the way through. These diapers are great and made our life so much easier. We use an adult bladder protection pad on the inside so that we don't have to wash the diapers so often. We just throw away the liner pads and put the diaper back on with a new pad. Sometimes the pad soaks through to the diaper, but the diaper has never leaked.",1
Exactly what I was looking for.,1
"I take Carnitine for recovery and endurance, this product does the job, and does it well.",1
It was so beautiful.,1
Covered up the common RAM rust spots well. Great looking product!,1
The jacket was just as we expected. Thank you.,1
"Received the new band and was able to install in seconds. Band appears to be much sturdier than what came with the original fitbit. Original band would fall apart under stress, this one stays put so you don't risk losing your fitbit.",1
This is a good product. Would definitely purchase again.,1
"First off, it's in my favorite color! They have a great choice of colors, and orange is mine. It arrived in great shape and is a thing of beauty. I got tired of my ex wife waxing lyrical about her stupid Yeti (in blah stainless steel), so I did the ice test: eight ice cubes in each tumbler, same temperature, side by side. The swig actually had slightly less melted ice than her Yeti, so that's a victory for team Swig! I also bought the can cooler, and as I go along, will purchase all of the Swig products in orange. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this product!",1
Only real problem is that people can hear the noise from your headset but besides that perfect,1
"I wasn’t impressed with the size of the container for the price, until I tried it! I’m a Postal worker, and my fingertips and cuticles were always getting cuts in them due to all the paper I touch drying my hands out. I started using this two weeks ago and they are now soft and healed over! I’m impressed!",1
Easy to peel and stick. They don't fall off.,1
I am great fan of Jake Needham's books. And this novel is an example of why I enjoy how I enjoy them. The plot flows. And it is very readable. And realistic. Needham is one of the few authors that buy as soon as they are published. Do yourself a favor and buy this book.,1
I use them for mountain biking fell twice with them on both times glad I had put them on great protection,1
"This karaoke microphone is awesome. Its design is cool. When I connected it to my phone first time, it’s easy and quick to connect. The sounds is very good. I love to sing a song with this microphone. It let my voice better than before.",1
Nate is one of the baddest good guys out there. And the allusions to so much mythology is like Percy Jackson on steroids,1
"spacious , love it and get many compliments",1

"What can I say? They do the job and my boss asked me to throw out the plastic stirrers which he said would impact on our health due to chemicals in the plastic that would be released. Oy. What next? I personally use a metal spoon to stir. I'm sure someone will find something wrong with that as well! However, the stirrers serve their purpose and my boss is happy. That makes me happy!!!",1
"I bought this book and the McGraw hill book and I really liked the Smart Edition book better. The answer explanations were more detailed and I actually found quite a few errors in the McGraw hill book, I stopped using it after that and just used this one. This one also comes with the online version of the tests and flashcards so it really is a better deal",1

"Perfect for diabetic foot pain. My boyfriend has diabetes and I was tired of always rubbing his feet to ""push the blood out of them"". Now he sits on the couch for an hour each night wearing these, wondering why we never heard of these before! The only issue is, its hard to figure out which one is the left and which one is the right. They are labeled on the side but its hard to see. I ended up putting a label on the right one to know which is which. I have tried them too, they are great.",1
This charger is awesome!!!,1
"This is a very nice skirt. The lacy pattern is classy and soft. It doesn't wrinkle, even after being crammed into plastic and a box it was very smooth, so that's really cool. This can easily be dressed down or dressed up, and has a kind of vintage feel due to the length and cut, which I'm really into. I think this could be flattering on anyone. I'm 5'5"" and 130 pounds and I ordered the small, so I would say if you feel like you're stuck between a small and medium, definitely size down.",1
Sweet collar for small cats or dogs. Has matching harness and leash available separately for purchase.,1

I've been taking this for a while now and seems to really be boosting my keto diet this time around. I'm excited to see my results in a couple more weeks!,1
Ordered this to put in my sons room. The heat gets trapped in the corner where his bed is and I wanted just a small fan to help circulate the air. This is great. My favorite part is that you can choose the angle. Shared some pictures to show you. Enjoy yours!,1

Daughter loves them. Fits perfect.,1
Works amazing with my dress shoes and canvas shoes!,1

Easy to clean as long as you clean it directly after using of course. Works great. Very happy,1

Little loose on side But comfy,1

Gets the job done the way it needs to.,1
"The piano is great starters! It finds your child’s inner artistic ability and musical talent. It develops a good hand-eye coordination. The piano isn’t only a play toy, but it actually works and allows your child to play music at an early age. If you want your child to be a future pianist, you should try this product out! Very worth the money!",1
"Great diaper bag!! A lot of room for everything I need for my babies (I have 2) , lightweight even if the bag is full of things! Highly recommend!",1

Raised his levels to where they needed to be. Also, they taste so good that he begged me for them each day. I highly recommend these supplements.",1

"This is great for my life proof nuud case. I see it doesn’t cover the full screen entirely but it’s very slight and doesn’t impair functionality. It is working great so far I love how sleek the screen feels, almost naked like if it was the iPhone glass itself. I give it 5 stars due to the fact I already dropped it twice on its face and it still hasn’t broke on day one! I will keep u updated on the wear and tear over time.",1
Great selection. I like the covers too.,1
I use to get these all the time. I missed them till I found them here. Do not like hot. These are perfect.,1

I have been using sea salt and want to mix this in for the iodine.,1

Works really good and goes super fast.,1
"I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper.

"Please never change this formula! I have tried many mineral and combination sunscreens including Elta MD and PCA Skin and this one is the best. I distribute all over my face and then pat in with my hands to get the best results. I use Retin-A for acne and need a sunscreen everyday for multiple applications and I've done 3-4 applications and had it still look nice on my face. No white cast in person and in pictures, not greasy and does not make me break out. On top of all of that, it is very affordable compared to other facial sunscreens. For reference, I am mixed so I have a slightly tanned/olive complexion.",1
These switches are awesome I've installed both of them and they work as expected I only wish they had a day-night on them,1
We recently purchased an Amazon echo Dot so we are slowly adding more and more smart devices to our home and figured this would be the perfect start. These smart lightbulbs have been so much fun and work wonderful with Alexa. The installation was a breeze and we haven't had any issues so far. The color are bright and there are so many options. I'm actually thinking about getting another pack for the other rooms in our house.,1
This was a gift for my grandson....he loved it.,1
"Update after 3 months: Still great. Comfortable & fits well. Just the slightest sign of wear on edge near point of attachment. No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later. The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2. I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise. So far there aren't any wear marks around the buckle. All in all a good deal.",1
This was a perfect wrap for my outfit that I wore to a wedding!,1
"I am an artist and was asked to present a “how to” to a Girl Scout troop. It’s so reasonably priced I could afford to give one to each of the girls. I really appreciated having the opportunity to introduce art to those young people, and they LOVED walking away with this gift.",1

At first I didn't care too much for this resin. But then I bought a better lamp and it works amazing! I noticed though if you leave it in for too long it does yellow a bit. But aside from that it's great!,1
It’s so cute! I gifted this for a baby shower. My friend loved it. I was not able to feel the blanket. But the feedback was that is so soft. It looks soft from the picture that was sent to me.,1
Nice pan. Well made. I can't find anything negative to say.,1
My grandson loves it. The he door opens and closes and locks,1
I usually don't watch these movies but this one got me. It's low budget but good and not a predictable as you think. Nice Twist to the ending.,1

I reuse my Nespresso capsules and these fit perfectly and keep all coffee grounds out.,1

Worked perfect for my wedding tables,1
Quite happy with these cards. They are a larger size than many I've seen and the rose stickers for sealing are a nice touch.,1
"I am very pleased with every aspect of this camera. It's a little more expensive than some other, but for the quality and reliability you get, I'd say it was well worth it.",1
Loved the book and how quick of a read it is,1
"I tried a few LED harnesses and none were bright enough to see my black dog at night running through the woods. This vest, as long as not directly in front of head/tail, is super visable.",1
These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces. The light stays on for weeks but becomes dim after 3 or 4 days. We had a great time leaving the extra ones around the party and will use the extra ones for fun.,1
I am very happy to have purchased this item. I have a small 9mm Glock that fits perfectly along with a unit for extra clips or while walking I am able to carry my cell phone in the pocket.

It gets under the couch and coffee table with ease. It's very easy to empty and clean , and since it doesn't require bags it's already saving me money. Might buy one for upstairs as well 💜",1
"I used the Sony speaker for about three years and it was broken. This time I bought a cheaper one. But it sounds like a loud and clean voice. I like to pair easily, I like it very much, because I can also use TF card. Due to its compact size, the bottom of the product is made of rubber and does not slide even on the dashboard when driving. Can be recommended to anyone who cannot complain. This is very useful！",1
"As ease, fits me. Mens front pouch.",1
"We've all been lied to, that's a fact. Andy Andrews shows us the depth we have sunk to by the lies. We need to expect truth from those in the political arena or elect those people that will speak the truth. You don't want your friends to lie, why accept it from elected officials. Apathy is running rampant. We need to be able to discern truth and it can only be found if we are willing to look for it. Check things out, don't always take what someone says as truth. A short, but powerful, book.",1
"Alexa, and I thought it didn't work any more... Da, power button...",1

Good quality product for the price. Well constructed and packaged.,1
"I restore camera lenses and work on electronics as a hobby. I remove lots of screws and it really helps when the bits are magnetized. This magnet is way more than adequate to magnetize my screwdriver bits. A word of caution, they are VERY strong magnets and can hurt your fingers if you are not careful.",1
This is an awesome coffee bar! We put it to fairly easy. Just make sure you look at the piece and figure out which is the front and back. I had to take it back apart and turn some around.,1

Perfect fit well made.,1
Very sturdy and light weight. Used it for my hammock,1
Will continue to buy.,1
Seems to be accurate and I like that i dont have to try to stick anything in my kids ears now.,1

Good material. Fits as expected. Soft and comfortable to wear. I would recommend it.,1
"The case and disc were clean when I got them. No cracks to the case and the game worked as needed. The game itself is wonderful, full of adventure. There isn't much in replay value per se, yet most of the players find themselves going back for more, if only to level up their characters.",1
This arrived on time and was packaged nicely which I appreciate.,1

"great throw for high end sofa, and works with any style even contemporary sleek sectionals",1
"This so so much better than swallowing 4 pills. The scoop that comes in really helps, and I just mix it with water and there's really no taste. I've done 1 month of the pills and 1 month of the powder and I believe I'm seeing results already!",1
These smell fantastic and burn an extremely long time (some over an hour!) The scents are strong and linger many hours! Extremely happy with these!,1
Thank you funko for creating a Latin America Icon. I am a collector and this has more of a sentimental value than anything else. Family Memories.,1
These baby bib are cute. They are soft to wear and water proof. Very easy to clean. My kid loves them.,1
"Exactly as described, works well",1
My grandkids (age 3 & 4) loved them.,1
Have used with several loads of laundry. Gentle to fabrics and seem gentle to my skin.,1
Great product and super fast shipping,1
Fit as expected to replace broken cover,1
"This drive is blazing fast. I'm getting 300 MB/s in write speeds. I was able to transfer a 3GB file onto the drive within seconds, literally",1
"I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.",1
"Great little speaker! The sound was loud and clear. I’ve had others that didn’t sound good when you turned the volume up, no problems with this one. It also paired quickly with my phone. Would definitely recommend.",1
"We love the auto lock feature on this deadbolt. Now when the grandsons come in, I don't have to worry about them not locking the door back!",1
I absolutely love this necklace. I was afraid that it would look cheap or poorly made but it is wonderful.,1
Perfect quality my sis loved them!,1
"I bought this set to go in my sunroom. I love the aged look; it doesn't show dirt as easy as some rugs I have had. They are very sturdy and the colors are just beautiful. I have received so many compliments on the rugs. The gripper back on all the rugs hold securely in place with normal traffic. Overall this is a beautiful, functional set.",1
Water pump works perfectly and arrived as promised.,1
Great variety. Thank you.,1
Worked great on my clients edges. If you combine it with too many products though it could turn white so just be careful,1
"Easy to install, fits perfectly, and does a good job.",1
"My husband is picky about his underwear, but he loves these! They run a little small. My hubby wears M, but I bought these in L. And they fit him perfect. He says the best thing about them (besides comfort, obviously) is the solid piece in the front. There’s no flap. I have always had to hand-sew the flaps closed on all his other underwear. But, not anymore. I love Starter!",1
Great quality but too wide to fit BBQ Galore Grand Turbo 4 burner with 2 searing bars.,1
These little lights are awesome. They put off a nice amount of light. And you can put them ANYWHERE! I have put one in the pantry. Another in my linen closet. Another one right next to my bed for when I get up in the middle of the night. Have only had them about a month but so far so good!,1
"These notebooks really keep me on track, love them!",1
They are so comfortable that I don't even know I am wearing them.,1
"If you are going on a trip on rt 66 from east to west, buy this. To me, it is the visual version of a guide book. You still need state maps.",1
"Great,just what I want",1
"Come with pretty cool pack. Very practical, exactly match all my needs, easy to use and clean , especially convenient for people with teeth socket",1
Best light I've ever had,1
Adhesive is good. Easy to apply.,1
I will definitely order again!!,1
Love these rollers! Very compact and easy to travel with!,1
"Love this towel! So cute and soft! It’s also very thick, which is nice because it absorbs super well! Love that they are organic too! Everything about this towel is perfect!",1
". I measured for an extra large and I find it a bit too tight for long term wear but IS a quality and great product. at this price I may buy an additional two at the XXL size, only $20. Up till now, I've been using Kinetic Tape [KT] another good product but not always water proof and needs constant attention not to mention IF it always takes on my skin. THIS product satisfies all the above.",1
My cats went CRAZY over this!,1
I loved this show and was so disappointed when it was cancelled after six seasons.,1
This dress is very comfortable. I would recommend wearing a slip under it as it is very thin. I’m going to have to hem the bottom because it’s long. I’m 5’5” and even in wedges it hits the floor. But it’s great for the price!,1
going to order more soon,1
Great for health & sickness!,1
"I purchased the dark blue distressed rug, and it is just as pictured and so beautiful! For a low/medium pile rug, it is very soft and feels great under bare feet. I will update this review with a photo asap.",1
"Sturdy and works well. The main problem is if you have imperfectly shaped apples, then you still need a knife to cut out the part of the apple core that the cutter sometimes didn't get, but that's how all the apple slicers like this are. I've used it for three months and it still works great. I don't know why I didn't buy one earlier.",1
"Much nicer than my last plastic tongue cleaner. Thorough job, easy to clean and helps to keep up daily dental care.",1
Got order in 2 days with prime and the sheets fits my thick mattress perfect. Will buy again,1
I really love this handbag! It is adjustable and has several pockets for organizing and finding things easily! It is nicely made and feels and looks like leather. I would definitely recommend it!,1

Provides good amount of steam. Super quiet.,1
absolutely does what was advertised!,1
"Great product as always from SanDisk. Great write speed, quick downloads onto your computer, etc. I'll continue to buy as needed.",1
"Honestly, this is a great product. We have owned it for over a year now and it lasted 2 winters, as well as a summer used in the pool as a raft...and it’s still in great condition. We look forward to using it over and over again over the next few years!",1
"as advertised, took a little bit of work to install. It was going over an above ground pool to provide a small amount of shade.",1
"I used these too replace the chrome screws on my Strat's black pick guard. The screws were all well formed, nicely finished, none of them broke, and they look great to me on my guitar. The price was right and I got them in a day or so.",1
I loved the product! It’s natural and it took away all the itchy redness my granddaughter had! Poor thing would wake herself up itching. Now she sleeps well and feel better:),1
"This product exceeded my expectations. I am not good about cleaning my make up brushes. In fact when I received this cleaner it had been months since I last cleaned them. So I figured at best they should be a little better off. It was better than that! My brushes are like new! A couple I needed to clean two times, but considering how much build up on them there was, was completely warranted. I’m so excited that I discovered this product as I finally have a reason to buy nicer brushes! Clean up was easy!",1
"I loved this adapter. Arrived on time and material used was good quality. It works great, this is convenient when I use this in my car, it can use headset when you charging. It is a very good product!",1
Very flattering leggings. I am 5ft 4inches and 150 pounds and ordered a Large. They are not too tight and fit me perfectly. I love the fact that they are mainly cotton. The material is thick enough to not be see-through and not thin like t-shirt fabric. You could size down if you like a snugger fit.,1
We just took a 3 day road trip from Cape Cod Ma. To Big Pine Key Fl. The ice packs did their job! Everything stayed frozen!,1
This was the perfect solution to our extra large bay window. This connected perfected!,1
Easy to install and works great!,1
The product is perfect for my classroom. It provides a wonderful flex seating option. The company also was supportive when I had a small issue. Great customer service!,1
"I love this clock! This is my third clock from this company. Two have been this same clock. One was a more ornate model, which I ended up not liking. The quality is good. This is a good vendor to deal with. Definitely recommend the clock and the vendor.",1
"I have an issue with my right knee - managed to get baker's knee. My physical therapist recommended these sneakers - I will be forever grateful. Very good fit, from the first try. Absolutely no issues, great support. Can walk for miles with no pain in my knees or back. Perfect.",1
I love this tea kettle! It’s so easy to use and the automatic shut off is amazing. It takes less than 5 minutes from cold water to a nice hot cup of tea!,1
"Doesn’t take much but a dot in my V8. It’s fire hot, not made for the weak.",1
I really like the answers of the practice questions. They give you reasoning as to why the wrong answers are not right.,1
Not as good as the 1st Verison but has really good graphics,1
A great sweater for a holiday party. Make sure it’s cool enough to wear though - it’s SUPER WARM!,1
So cute! And fit my son perfect so I’m not sure about an adult but probably would stretch.,1
Very easy to put on and are much more comfortable.,1
"Bought this set to work in a folding box oven that goes over my camp stove. Work great. They are well made and this,set is even cheaper and better made the a set I saw at walmart.",1
"I loved this rose gold color and everything about it was great! The only thing I had an issue with, was it was really plain. I like having a little more detail in the handles and I did notice that before I purchased it which is why I still give this 5 stars! It was easy to clean and all came in wrapped individually which I found to be really organised and it calmed my soul lol love, love, LOVE the color and I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a loved one!",1
Great addition to my Lego collection.,1
"Any P&R fan needs this shirt. My son absolutely loves the show and every time he wears this shirt we are constantly singing, ""Bye-bye, Lil Sebastian!""",1
Good item and great price,1
Love it came so fast!!! Thank you.,1
I have been using this is in my room with peppermint oil to keep bugs away and it seems to be helping. I had no problem figuring out how to use it. I like how it has different timers and auto shut off. My only concern is the oil seems to go faster than the water and I go through a bunch of oil.,1
This was a fun read...looking forward to the next,1
Quick delivery great product,1
"Does what it says, works great.",1
"My brothers and I, all veterans, wanted to replace my dads flagpole for his birthday. I'm not sure what we expected as far as the circumference of light illuminating the flag but I consider this perfect as both of my parents were able to see the flag and have commented on it several times. Just what we wanted. I would ask folks to understand that this light is really for home use and does not illuminate a large area on the ground. As it is mounted on top of the pole the circumference of light is smaller and stronger at the top while larger and weaker on the ground. Thus don't expect your flag and pole to be lit like a government building. If you want that, buy a different commercial grade light.",1
Perfect size and good quality. Great for cupcakes,1
Loved this book.. Couldn't put it down!! Loved every single character in this book. Starts with a bang and finishes with one.,1
"At first, I was unlucky to receive a defective unit that lasted two months. I sent the company a private complaint (admittedly, a little bit too bitter), and they responded immediately in a way that surprised me: ""We sincerely apologize and we just shipped you a replacement. We want you to be happy with our product."" They didn't ask for a proof of the problem nor to send my defective unit back. I got the replacement in just two days after I complained! And it works perfectly. I highly respect the company that treats their customers so well, and I love their product.",1
Good quality product for decent price,1
Great characters and keeps the intensity. I can't wait to read the next one. Please make more for this series.,1
This song deserved to be #1.,1
"Tastes great, hope it works.",1
"I have seen a few ants around my apartment almost every day recently, so I bought this little device to see if it works. It is actually pretty effective. I have not seen any ants for days now. It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.",1
Granddaughter lived it!,1
Love listening to these CDs. Would recommend!,1
"Just received them (very quick service) and they are just as pictured, maybe even better. Got 4 shells, all in perfect condition and various colors and the plants were big, bushy and very healthy. Easy to assemble and they are adorable. Thanks!!!! Highly recommend.",1
My husband is in law enforcement and loves this bag.,1
Grandkids loved them,1
There is so much to see and talk about on each page! It's like a 'Finding Waldo' book. Great way to spark communication and learning about all that is happening on each page! My 2 year old grandson loves this book!,1
"Only just received this surfer and although I have only tried paracord bracelet on for size (which is great) I have had no time to wear it for any length of time, yet but rope bracelet does seem well made fashionable.. being around sail boats for most of the week it fits in with my lifestyle. I think it is good braided bracelets for men",1
"Helps hide cargo when parked and also partitions off the cargo area from the cabin, making air conditioning and heating work more effectively.",1
Works great. Really enjoy listening to radio from other countries. Can't believe it was so low priced.,1
"The boxing is amazing and the product came well packaged. The earbuds have amazing bass and are loud without having to turn up the volume much. The sound quality is mediocre. They fit well in my ear and does not fall out when I'm running or playing a sport. These are not bad wireless sport earbuds, especially for the low price.",1
What I liked most is that the ink cartridge actually worked!,1
"Excellent product, and I'm using it with the colon Detox/Cleanser...excellent results! Highly recommend this product and especially the brand name of Bio Schwartz!",1
"Since the banks have or are doing away with coin counting machines, this is the next best thing. I can watch TV and get the coins wrapped in no time.",1
Quality is great for the price. Installation is easy !,1
"While this product is motion activated, I use it from dusk to dawn lighting of my drive-way. With it being LED I really haven't noticed much of an increase in my electric bill. I like that it is a wired unit that does not rely on solar power. It is really bright and lights up the entire front yard. I would buy again.",1
Comfortable and Compact. A luxury item you don't want to be without!,1
They’re cute and work well for my kids. Price is definitely great for kids sheets.,1
A nice solid headphone hanger! Spring loaded to clip on to most desk / surfaces. It has 2 foam pads for both grip and to protect the surface that you clip it to. I like that it has a cord holder built in to keep your cord secure. The bottom bracket swivels 360 degrees for use with almost any desk or table.,1
My son Loves it for his 6 years old birthday! The package including everything you need. Highly recommend,1
Bought the wrong color so looked like an idiot trading in a rose gold and black iPhone lol product was quality though for sure,1
This Mouse has a very sleek design and comfortable in use. no click sound at all. but since my palm is big hence it is not very convenient to use so long. if mouse design is a little bit big then it will be great. most suitable for women hand.,1
"Only gave 4 stars for durability since I have not had the case very long; case fits very well & gives me a more secure feeling when I am holding my phone. Since I am not someone who is always looking at the phone there was no need for a ""fancy""cover. This frost cover is ok but has no dazzle if that's your style.",1
I love all the quality of the products i have biught them,1
Sounds amazing with the 3” mbrp downpipe. I haven’t tested at highway speeds but i love it so far. Figment was good. Just wish it was in less pieces.,1
"Good quality, good color, no color difference, wallpaper is OK, good design, good material, good workmanship, no odor, at first, I was worried about sticking bad, pasted a very OK, as long as the size is good and simple, easy to fix well is not bad, overall is still great.",1
Very useful. Good quality. It protects my hand very well,1
Good deal for a good price,1
My wife loves this movie,1

My daughter loved the costume and it fit perfectly.,1
"The glitter gel flows, its super cute.",1
"I like it, It’s very easy to use the screwdriver to change my old nose pads, and the nose pads are very soft, great product!",1
The filters arrived on time. The quality is as expected.,1
This is my Monkees in its entirety. Every album. All the joy in one boxed set.,1
The bags are awesome!! Kids loved them,1
When you have a refrigerator that filters the water for you you need to be sure the filters are replaced in a timely way. Kenmore made the original filter so you have to stick with what you know is a good product and does the job.,1
Keeps my water cold for well over 24 hours!,1
"Very nice quality, I was pleasantly surprised!!",1
I got a thank you card asking for a review . Saying their a Small family buisness. I bought this as a gift and the boy loves it ..,1
I always love the over the top males and Instalove and this book has both . It was a perfect quick read.,1
This is very heavy duty!!! Easy to mount and very versatile!!! I was very pleased with it! First wall mount that I have ever purchased and installed. I installed it by myself and it being so heavy made that a little difficult. You might want to have someone help you.,1
This fit the vaccum perfectly!!! My parents will never know I lost the original cap. Lol fast shipping too. It arrived in 2 days with standard shipping.,1
"The product, material, designs and comfortable and soft for babies. Lovely prints and colours too.",1
Perfect light at a very reasonable price,1
"We didn't buy this for our beards because we don't have any. However, my wife uses this for our daughters hair. It does a great job and it heats up pretty quickly compared to our last one. I don't know what kind of material they used for the brush part but it's high quality. The cord is nice and long for them. I recommend this if you're looking for a good hair straightener.",1
I bought these for a replacement for the original band that broke. Fits perfectly with no issues.,1
It is very helpful to prevent slipping for my high heels which does not have good protection. I will repeat the order for my all shoes.,1
"All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can't really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it's overall usability.",1
Better than I expected. Great value,1
Very nice product. Feels solid not cheap.,1
"I'm never buying pads again! I've been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They're super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies. These are soft, hypoallergenic, and super absorbent without feeling like wearing a diaper or something (at least, that's how I used to feel wearing pads). The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.",1
These are really cute. I love all the earrings from this company. Good quality for fashion jewelry. The kind you can have for years. Super cute and unique.,1
Great price and very easy install,1
"There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2"" too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can't wait to fire up the grill!",1
These feel nice after a long day. Warm them up in the oven for a bit and instant relaxation.,1
"A great purchase. I was looking at pottery barn chairs but was so put off by their price that I looked elsewhere. This chair is very comfortable, looks fabulous, and great for nursing my baby.",1
Very powerful. I made whipped cream in less than a minute. Makes great mayo. I'm on the paleo diet and this is a must have.,1
Great size. Fits on my mantle.,1
"I had never used this style of connector before, they are great, work perfectly and save huge amounts of time.",1
"Got them for all the grandkids and they loved them , six kids from one to seven and it was a hit with every one of them .",1
"What I liked most it’s very vibrant, least favorite is bottle is smaller than expected",1
The faucet came quickly and with a few tweaks on our end works perfectly! We are very happy with it. Amazed at how inexpensive it was but looks and functions like the expensive one! (And We replaced an expensive one!),1
Perfect shrug that turns sleeveless into something more professional.,1
These were a birthday gift and she just loved them. Great product and service.,1
I love these magnetic shape toy. My son and me have been making many things and its very therapeutic for him,1
"This is a superb wallet! I love the texture, design and size. All my business cards and checks fit in it perfectly. I will probably buy it again.",1
Love this lipstick. Glides on and stays moist for hours. Great purchase,1
The low volume is quite good just a little louder than expected but that’s okay,1
They fit and don’t leak. The gauge reads full with a full tank. Have yet to run them down to see how they read when they get lower. Will update the review if necessary.,1
The product covered was a wireless mic receiver and transmitter. I covered ith with square trade for three years. After 1 1/2 years of use the product stopped working. I contacted square trade and within 24 hours my claim was duly attended to my satisfaction.,1
Interesting perspective on America and Politics today.,1
"Great product, I got this for my dad because he tends to drop a lot of objects and when i got him his airpod case, i was worried it might break. This case did the job and the texture made it non slip so it wont fall off surfaces as easily. The clip also makes it easy for my dad to clip it to his work bag so it wont get lost easily.",1
It was relatively easy to assemble this spice rack following the instructions. I love that the height is adjustable because when I initially set it up it didn't fit where I want it. But no problem it was easy enough to adjust the height and now I have a very organized pantry. Very happy with the purchase!,1
"Perfect fit, makes my refrigerator look new again.",1
"My husband really likes these, gives him energy to make it through the day, plus has been able to concentrate better. Just in a couple weeks he has lost some weight. I can even tell a difference in his concentration when I talk to him.",1
These were recommended to me by another landscaper they’re very good quality don’t think twice get your three pack get out there go back to work,1
Taking to reduce inflammation and pain in lower back. Seems to help with that but also very noticeable improvement in wound healing.,1
Excellent quality. Strong.,1
"Works perfectly for soccer, football, gym balls.",1
Strong material which is great because I always seek to rio my knee highs. Look great and fit my size 11 feet well.,1
I highly recommend this product. I ordered these for my grandchildren to share a bit of the UK. Our uncle would send them to us every year and I wanted to share the wonderful memory. They arrived on time and in perfect condition. I'm a bit partial but I think Cadbury is the very best in quality and flavour.,1
"This is an amazing product! It smells amazing, plus... i got the smallest one, and it has lasted me about 4 months so far!",1
"The parcel came quickly. The texture is pleasant, extinguishes well, overcomes shortcomings. Excellent tonal cream.",1
Easy to use and carry around. Basic.,1
I have been searching for a deodorant that works and is natural. This one works great! It smells so nice and lasts all day,1
This was very easy to use and the cookies turned out great for the Boy Scout Ceremony!,1
It is a great product. It looks awesome with the cigars in it and more importantly it keeps humility great.,1
"I can not tell you how many times I have bought one of these. My dogs are obsessed with them! The legs don’t last long but the rest of it does, probably one of the longer lasting toys they have had.",1
Taste great and makes for a perfect snack to keep in your desk draw bc of ye seal. Hard to find in grocery stores.,1
A handy piece of equipment for some creative lighting.,1
The product is a perfect fit replacement. The stainless steel bars should last much longer than the originals which rusted out.,1
"I like this concept, I think you have done an acceptable job, created a device that successfully burned down the letters of wood and other things, but I hope this letter is more straight, not a rounding end. This requires a slight rolling of the letter to make it even. I also hope that these letters will be further highlighted, because if you press too hard, it will also burn unnecessary background.",1
"Love it! As with all Tree to Tub Products, I’ve incredibly happy with this toner.",1
"Received this file box last night, and begin to put my documents in as soon as I received it. It is very good for me as my husband and I get a lot paperwork to save. The colorful tags make it easier to find what I want. The material is strong. I finally get something to help with the messy drawer! Love this product! I believe I will buy another one when this one is full!",1
"This tent is amazing. It might be a little steep in price, but after you set it up in just 5 minutes you will know it's worth every penny. The built in light is very useful.",1
Great price. Easy to clean. Use them for everything. Good quality. Exactly as pictured. I even throw the covers in the dishwasher and no rust--- very good product.,1
Super cute. Super small but great for my 4 year Old just her size.,1
I like the idea that there are words that an be used for many things. They cut clean with no problems.,1
Delicious. Very easy to digest. Consistency a little bit different from regular rice but once we adjusted to that this quickly become one of our favorites. Delighted to have found this quality non-GMO product.,1
"Polar is fantastic, and this one is wonderful, rechargeable, and also I can swim with measurements of strokes etc.",1
"Great solar charger, but thick and heavy. Not for light-weight travel. Otherwise, this thing keeps literally everything charged. Great buy and very happy.",1
Outstanding product exceeds my expectations....,1
This is exactly what I needed. The cd drive in my laptop broke and this little thing is just perfect for my needs. I love the case it comes with too. Really easy to setup and just works.,1
These patches are easy to apply and stay on. I use them for my freestyle sensor.,1
My niece love these balls! Everyone is different.,1
"Decent enough terminals served the purpose, used them to tap into existing truck wires to install aftermarket gauges. Would buy again if I needed them.",1
Fits perfectly. Well thought out.,1
I really like the way the case works as a stand and that you can stand the ipad at different angles.,1
Was using 5 mil thickness doing car work. They'd split all the time. I get amazing life out of these gloves even when exposed to petroleum and detergents.,1
"This is a well made device, much higher quality than the three previous cat feeders we've tried. The iOS app works well although the design is a little confusing at first. The portion control is good and the feeder mechanism has worked reliably. The camera provides a clear picture and it's great to be able to check remotely that the cat really is getting fed. Setup was relatively easy.",1
Worked with the torch. Blue flame. It burned hot enough to destroy aluminum foil,1
Made a money gift fun for all,1
Installed this on our boat and am very happy with the results. Great product!,1
"Vibrant color, soft and very comfortable.",1
It's a great watch! This is my 2nd purchase of the G-Shock. Unfortunately I lost my 1st which was still going strong after 2 yrs. Love the watch. Simply having a cell phone just doesn't cut it to tell me time. Plus it's a fashion statement. I would recommend this watch and the entire G-Shock series!!,1
"I love this board can be mounted with just a few thumb tacks. There are no major holes left in the wall. It comes with all the tacks needed and 4 colors of erase markers. It rolls up, which is portable and nice. I run a home based business, the daily calendar has ceased marital debates about the schedule. I wish I had found this 4 years ago. Also if you live in an apartment, the Property Manager will appreciate the very small footprint it leaves. Thank you!!",1
Just as described and expected!,1
Nice router no issues,1
great movie....I enjoyed watching it.,1
"I have this installed under my spa cover to help maintain the heat. My spa is fully electric (including the heater), and this has done a good job reducing my overall electric bill by about 15% - 20% each month since last November. Quality is holding up fine, but it's out of the sun since it's under the spa cover. (Sorry, can't comment on what the longevity would be in the full sun.)",1
"This book is so inspiring and engaging, I read the book in only 2 days. Good info about real estate investing and different strategies mentioned in the book is absolutely phenomenal. I recommend this book!",1
"These coasters are super cool and works well,they would also make a great gift.",1
I usually buy jackets in XL but this one runs large so I bought a L. Fits great and doesn’t smell like fish like the dickies pants do. Very nice and thick.,1
"Works great , use it quite often",1
These are made to fit glasses that are thin from top to bottom width is good,1
"Nice little case! Vibrant color, room for credit cards and phone!",1
"Just like sucking large particles, I don't seem to see signs of blockage. This is the premise that I like it.",1
"I checked out local stores, and all the Depot and hardware stores sold these at $10 to $15 more than buying on amazon. Yes I could of had one that same minute at the stores. I wasn't driving around wasting gas for this hitch by the way lol, I was shopping for tools and other stuff in separate days, I just always checked to see how much they would be when I needed on. With that said, I have hauled many things other than this light weight quad. I used the same hitch on my F150 to pull a 12ft trailer, and it doesn't have a dent or scratch on the hitch or ball. This is a 2"" ball, light duty stuff but it's heavy duty for 7,000 pounds if your vehicle can tow that much weight!",1
"I absolutely love this iPad case. It’s extremely stylish and durable. I’ve had it a couple months and it still looks brand new. It’s magnetic so it wakes up whenever you open the case, which is very helpful. The case also has 3 different ways you can adjust it when standing. Overall, this is a really great case.",1
My cheerleaders loved being able to pick out their own socks,1
It works really great. I highly recommend it.,1
Love the 3 books of the series!,1
Purchased the blue color... It's very big but provides a lot of shade. It doesn't touch my neck or get in the way when I work. Had to use a piece of Velcro on my hard hat and the shade because it kept wanting to spin around when I worked but other than that I love it.,1
I am extremely satisfied with the flair pens I ordered. Shipping was very prompt and the product arrived in excellent condition. The colors are very vivid and the tips are durable. Thank you for a great product!,1
True to color and a great size. The adhesive is actually very strong. Properly clean the surface before attempting to install. They take some patience and precision to install but the end result in beautiful and makes the space look more polished. We used them in our rv bathroom and love them. The color is dreamy.,1
"Very impressed by this screen protector! Many are hard to put on or get bubbles underneath them. This one was very easy to place and came with an alcohol wipe, microfiber cloth, squeegee, and a dust removal sticker. The screen applicator has little tabs that you can hold to place the screen. Shipping was not incredibly fast, but the product seems worth the wait.",1
"I love this water bottle. It's very soft to touch, not like the hard plastic from your typical water bottle. It has a little strainer cap under the list. It gives you the ability to add fruit to your water and prevent it from coming through the drinking portion of the bottle. What amazed me the most is it came with a bottle cleaner.",1
"I get in multiple fights at work and definitely needed this, mic will stay right after secure.",1
Very durable. All in one product.,1
Love these blades for my Gillette Fusion. I tried many cheaper razors and none worked as well. I do not use on my face as I’m a woman who just likes the Fusion better than any razor. The only issue is the top part flips back a lot and it hurts to shave that way but other than that they are great. Sadly this 3rd order will be my last due to price increase.,1
Absolutely love the set! My 2.5 yr old daughter is very happy with her bedding and describes the owl to us.,1
These fit perfectly and were comfortable to wear all day . They did squeeze or give me a headache. And obviously adorable! Had so much fun matching these with outfits on my recent girls trip.,1
Exactly as described. Beautiful rose gold color,1
"This toliet seat has been great for potty training! Fits perfectly and allows my daughter to have self sufficiency when she needs to use the toliet. I love the handles, very helpful for her, and the hook it comes with so we can have a clean place to store it while not in use.",1
Shipped fast and arrived as described. Don't know yet about quality and durability of this cover but it looks good and fits nicely,1
"Exactly what I expected. I ordered these to use in my bar as we rotate our beers often, and they look great.",1
I’ve never used a face scrubber before and this makes your face feel like you just got a facial at the day spa. I’m super impressed with this facial scrubber.,1
"Dude this is a really good flag and it's hanging on my wall, this is totally 5 stars, the only minor thing is instead of the seam on the black being a black seam it was yellow but other than that yee yee",1
"Love this product! Taste great, dissolves nicely in cold or warm liquids. The best part that I love about this product is there is just 1 ingredient....beet juice powder....nothing else and especially no Stevia or other sweetener!!!!",1
"I love the way Liv and Cole just naturally go together. She is high society and he likes to fly under the radar, so they balance each other out. This is a fantastic series that I just reread in its entirety. You won't be disappointed.",1
Great product and even better customer service. Don’t even bother getting an antler from any where else!,1
Love the fact that it comes with a case that looks very good and holds all my fishing equipment that I bought with it and very well love how compact it is it's a pick up and throw in your trunk fishing case with lures anchors and weights and all sorts of stuff that includes with it the fishing rod is really good and durable at a really good price this is a deal,1
Pretty cool . Fits note 10 and other stuff,1
"I'm have thick curly hair that I have to apply a lot of heat to just to get it semi-straight. And because I use only coconut oil it tends to leave my hair with a cooked kind of smell. This spray works! I sprayed my hair all over one time and it immediately cancelled the coconut odor out of my hair. The scent smells so nice and it's lightweight. I could smell it for about an hour or two and then it faded, but It totally canceled all the odor out of my hair...no more cooked smell. And I can use a little bit every day every time I curl my hair and it doesn't dry it out or change the texture whatsoever.",1
Good product. Screen protector hard as glass to scratch,1
Great fit... very warm.. very comfortable,1
"I’ve been looking for something like this for a long time. Easy to use, easy to clean. Would buy again and probably get some for Xmas gifts",1
The most awesome anal toy ever invented!!!,1
"So far my daughter loves it. She uses it for school backpack. As far as durable, we just got it, so we will have to see.",1
I think it's really cool right now but it could use some more updates on the video chat.,1
"This little gadget is amazing! This set includes everything you can possibly need. The accuracy of detection is super, the device is very compact and can easily go into your pocket, super easy to set up and use! Great item for the price!",1
I love that it keeps the wine cold.,1
This novel took my heart. If you’ve read Eleanor and Park you know your in for a whirlwind. It was everything I expected.,1
Excellent value and OEM quality. Satisfactory in every way.,1
These earbuds are really good.. I bought them for my wife and she is really impressed.. good sound quality.. no problem connecting to her phone.. and they look really good.. i like how the charging box looks as well.. i really think these are as good as the name brand buds.. would recommend to anyone..,1
"Worked without a hitch right out of the box. Didn’t have any issues. If it continues to function, it’s a great buy...cheaper than the iDevice I have...",1
This story was absolutely fantastic! Everything was fascinating the characters were so good that I could not put it down! The heroin was amazing. I really enjoyed this story!,1
"like the product ,was supposed to be a surprise gag gift. but now the suprise was spoiled since our email is a shared email address.Not good!",1
Had my first experience using a baking mat and loved it. Ordered these and have had good experiences so far making Christmas cookies. I love that I can put this right into the oven on a cookie sheet so I don't have to try moving my dough over to ruin the shape of the cut out cookies. Don't have to waste any more parchment paper! Easy clean up. It came with two so that was a nice bonus. Would make a good gift for a baker!,1
The ring was awesome even though it was a little too small but it was beautiful fit perfect,1
"Thank you, we are very happy with the item. Looks and feels great. Very easy to maintain. Highly recommended",1
These are super cute! Coworkers have given lots of compliments on the style. I ordered 3 pair for work and home :) haven’t had a headache since wearing these. love!,1
I like the size. It was a gift for my friend.,1
Great placement for toddlers!,1
When the 14 egg container did not fit in my refrigerator... this 12 egg container fit the bill!,1
Outstanding Overview! I can easily lose weight with great recipes from this book. I don't regret that i bought it. It is the best way to use intermittent fasting for muscle gain. well organized includes in this book. I,1
"Very good case, better then expected",1
Headbands work perfectly. Great purchase.,1
Very cute short curtains just what I was looking for for my new farmhouse style decor,1
"THIS IS A GODSEND. I have always walked my 2 girls on 2 separate leashes... One would zig, the other would zag, and before I knew it we were ALL THREE tied up in retractable leash cord. My hands were always full, holding the re-tractor case things. This allows for ONE leash, and each strap can be adjusted to be longer or shorter so you can even stagger your pups on this device. Made of solid material, doesn't make me fearful that it will break mid-walk. Great buy.",1
Would Not Use any other Cologne,1
"We bought this to do something unusual for a motorcycle lift. We have an electric bed and my wife developed physical constraints that keep her from crawling into bed because the legs of the bed are too high and therefor the bed is too high. So I bought this lift to raise her up about 6 inches and it works great. I have a high torque drill and uses it to rotate the mechanism. It works well! But, one question I plan to write the seller is: Because we are not lifting up some thing that is centered, the lift developed a side to side looseness that I want to fix. I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.",1
"Sharp as heck, be careful !!",1
"Kat has her hands full trying to solve the murder of a judge---and clear her husband's name. He is a district attorney and is too busy trying to get on top of a case that he inherited only a day or two before--thanks to that judge! So, in-between attempting to write her next book, taking care of the dogs and cooking so her husband will at least eat one meal a day--she calls on everyone possible to get to the bottom of this. She really meets up with some interesting characters. And of course everyone is telling her what they know--the phone is ringing off the hook--and she is using a lot of gas!! This delves into the porn industry in a very sensitive way-it will not offend anyone. It also tells ways to help those addicted. The ending will definitely surprise you and left me feeling sad for one of the characters, but not the murderer!",1
Love working my wife out with these gloves.,1
The peeler works exactly as I hoped it would. I bought it specifically to peel mangoes and it does a great job.,1
Great case and durable. My toddler son has really tested its limits and it has always protected my phone 100%. Very happy with this product!,1
Great to get so many at one low price,1
I bought this for my daughter for her new phone and she loves it! It fits the phone very well and looks super cute. It also feels nice and sturdy.,1
They fit perfectly and I feel like I have new UGGs.,1
One of the best music documentaries. So much information in short time. Could easily been a series.,1
"I love this product it’s worked great from the get go, I loved it so much and so did my boyfriend I bought him one too. My gray paint is coming off the bottom but apart from that everything seems to be working just fine.",1
Durable and super easy to use. Makes felting a hit faster. It comes in a Beautiful box to store it. Recommend.,1
"Cute, soft and great for a baby that’s 1 and loves Bubble Guppies.",1
Not only do I love how these products are made and what this company stands for but the products themselves are fantastic! The mask left my face feeling so clean and baby soft! I’m going to purchase a few as stocking stuffers!,1
"I’m horrible with eating late at night, I do it almost every night after dinner and I’m sure it’s part of the reason I’m overweight. But when I take this, the cravings are gone!!",1
"Good box, easy to install. Sturdy enough for basic key control.",1
"This is a must read for Americans who want to survive when terrorists disrupt everything in our daily routines. This book is a survival guide written as a story and told by interested, but flawed characters, much like most of us.",1
Worked as shown arrived very quickly,1
Love using this in my DIY cleaning supplies. Makes everything smell so clean and fresh!,1
"The Lego Series of video games has not disappointed us to date. This new game, The Incredibles 2, is just as exciting as the movie. In our home, this game has been fun for the whole family, kids and adults.",1
My daughter loves her bean bag chair!,1
"Works great on 5/8"" plywood for cornhole only a few holes so far.",1
I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more of this series soon.,1
Great book for daily living,1
Total upgrade from a 48” tv to this awesome picture and great value for a tv this size!! Super fast shipping as promised.,1
Super nice box!!! Got it next day!! Made really well .. I'm happy with it,1
This smells amazing without being over powering. It also works for sensitive skin dogs. Leaves the coat soft and shiny.,1
"Wow, I must say I’m impressed with how these came packaged and presented. They include instructions that give a link to a quick video on installation. I have applied many varied screen protector products. I found it really cool that I could feel confident ordering this for my mother or anyone else who doesn’t necessarily have experience with devices OR accessories. I’m giving 5 stars because everything came as described and I’m just impressed with the packaging for ease of installation.",1
well built for the price,1
Very comfortable and warm gloves.I bought these for very cold winter motorcycling.I wore them yesterday on a 50 minute ride in 20 degrees F and not one bit of cold sensation got to my hand.,1
Using the thermometer couldn't be easier. There's a single button that swaps between degrees F/C (Fahrenheit and Celsius). Accurate readings appear in just 3-5 seconds and to turn it off just swap the pen back on the side. This thermometer is a fantastic value and will be purchasing more for friends and family.,1
Great case. Daughter loves it.,1
My cats have no problem eating this . I put it in their food .,1
"My dog is loving her new toy. She has torn up others very quick, so far so good here. L",1
It's a great product over all. It had no issues sticking. Had the the first one for a few months on my vehicle and looks just fine. Both times I ordered they came on time.,1
Washes without fraying. Does fab job of keeping my pups feet clean when coming in from a wet chase in the yard.,1
Greate product. Leave no soupy taste.,1
Haven't hung it out but the flag has a nice feel to it.,1
I was worried that they wouldn't fit since most frames are too large for my face. These fit perfectly!,1
Super cute matching aprons! The color and design make it great for both mommy and daughter or mommy and son. I got them for my daughter in law and grandson to wear while baking together. He is only 1 year old but loves to hang out in the kitchen and play with the whisks and bowls. The apron will be big on him now though he is tall for his age. It appears to be the right size for a 2-3 year old.,1
"Quality oil, just what I needed for my potions.",1
"i absolutely love these! no more ripped clothes while carrying my poles around, no ripped seats and no holes in my fingers! couldn’t be happier",1
"These are very handy for organizing when packing. I was able to put them to use last night when my son stayed overnight at my parents. Usually his bag is full of toys and makes it difficult to get around them to his clothes, but I put all he needed in just the middle size packing cube and threw that in his bag, making it very easy to, rather than the usual digging around for socks, etc.",1
I loooove the smell of this oil and its charms are potent as well. I wear this often as my regular scent. About to order my 3rd bottle. <3,1
its good and works amazing comes to good use,1
"- Great quality desk - I would have expected to pay much more for the quality of the powder coating and the finish - Easy to put together - comes with all necessary tools (took 1 hour in total) - Great looking desk - very professional (I got the gray and black) - 60"" Wide surface leaves room for paperwork, etc - Cranks very easily to the fully up position (less than a minute) - Good quality casters allow you to move the desk when needed (also add to total height) - I am 6' tall and the height is perfect (though close to the top of the range)",1
Great ears buds. Loved that they came with a carrying case.,1
"This story keeps,going and it snares you in and you can’t put it down. I love reading Alex and Jamie’s story",1
Coasters worked out well.,1
Plug and charger in one - easy to transport!,1
This mattress is so comfortable the first day i got it i slept for hour. No more back pain or should soreness i loved it,1

"It is very comfortable, but a bit thick.",1
These raw cashews are delicious and fresh.,1
"I tested it in the sea an in a pool, it works well, get a bit of sand, but its easy to clean",1
I used for a party and was great !,1
"Favorite calendar that goes in my garage by my Triumph Street Twin. Pictures are gorgeous and love the info about bikes from years ago. If you like Triumph or old looking classic bikes, get this one",1
Was recommended to me and was all she said it would be,1
"These are amazing for the price. The macro lens a bit finicky, you have to be able to get very close for your subject for the focus to be right, (I mean so close you're almost touching). I about poked by eye out trying to get this picture but it was SOOO worth it. As long as you have some patience and are okay going through some trial and error, these are great!",1
"Exactly what it is, works great!",1
"Perfect little 1/24 scale trailer. Had to customize it to work with my set-ups, but all around good quality product. Thank you Amazon!",1
Great product. Exactly as advertised. Highly recommend.,1
Great product. Exactly what I ordered and very quick shipping. Thanks.,1
Awesome product. Have used on my hands several times since I received the product. My cuticles have softened and my hands are no longer dry.,1
Ordered these for a friend and he loved them!,1
"The ring is a little thicker than I expected, but it looks great and feels great. It fits so well that it leaves little space for my finger to get air.",1
"Very bright , can see where the dog is in complete darkness. Lights up dogs head and surrounding area.",1
Used for personal use. Not a professional.,1
"I wasn't paying attention and was utterly dismayed to realize this thing is 20 pages. I read the whole thing, thinking it was a sample from a book, and then suddenly no more. I need more!!",1
"This mat is amazing, you can definitely tell a difference between the slow and fast side of the mat. The straight line down the middle is the best teacher. A great product!",1
This is the second cable we have bought because the first one has done such a great job. It’s been reliable and looks/feels like new after several months of usage. Excellent quality.,1
"I look fabulous with this glasses on, totally worth it! :D",1
"Let me.start by saying when they say same day delivery, they are not playing ordered in the morning and got it later that afternoon. The tank is incredible good size has plenty of space It does not get in the way while you ride 2 thumbs up and 5 stars",1
It was recommended by a friend and found that things are really good to wear and I like them very much.,1
Great product will recomend,1
"Very nice and well built. It sure does shine. I bought the 3qt. size , when I should have purchased the 6qt. but it was of such a quality I decided to just buy a 6qt. in addition to this one.",1
easy to put on and has a nice view of the road.,1
Perfect fit and quick delivery!!,1
This adapter was used through Europe. It was GREAT. The USB outlets charged our phones and Fitbit each night and I could use my electric hair brush too. All good!,1
It keeps the litter box smelling nice.,1
Love this product! My husband just used it before a Spartan race for endurance! I am fat adapted and use it to boost my blood ketones on Sundays when I fast for 24 hours. Love it! Makes you feel very focused with lots of energy.,1
"Just what I need, Great",1
So far I’ve used my luggage twice and I have not had any issues.,1
"I’ve wasted a lot of money on no show socks over the years. They always slide off my heel, whether I buy the cheap ones from Walmart or the expensive ones from shoe stores. NOT ANYMORE! I’ve ordered these socks three times because they are the best that I’ve ever worn. I thought that they might lose their elasticity after a few washes but that hasn’t happened so far. I wear them with Vans and booties and they actually stay put!",1
"It's a perfect product, I use it for study and relaxation. Easy to assemble and lights are adjustable (can be turned off). It's also really quiet, barely any sound. If you need a diffuser that is for meditation, studying or relaxation, definitely pick this one!! Also, a great value for a 2 pack.",1
The second book of the Percy Place Series had me turning pages as fast as the first. I am thoroughly invested in the characters lives and need a third book!,1
I can recommend it! Perfect !,1
"As described, good price",1
Challenging. Love the fact that each session extends into 6 more days of devotional study. We are focusing each study for a 2 week period. Awesome focus point for personal growth as building meaningful relationships within our group. Thank you !,1
I haven't used it yet. The quality is very good with many functions. And it is very convenient with a diaper bag. The price is reasonable.,1
My son loves it! It works great and looks awesome!,1
"I'm very happy with these scissors. They are small (as most have stated) but are super sharp. The finger slots are great and feel like a smooth soft rubber. I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them.",1
I'm happy to have replaced our old rack with this one. Works well.,1
"Ok, we have a 40' trailer in a campground that during peak season has power issues with the voltage dropping well below 110v. I wasn't sure how or what this would do to the situation, but after plugging it in and comparing the voltage before and after, i was amazed. turn the microwave and the ac on, and this compensates to keep the voltage constant. If you have a trailer, you need one of these, it is well worth the money and will help protect your investment.",1
I love the length of this hose and the fact that it doesn't kink or curl in upon itself.,1
I was actually blown away by the quality of this costume...the little girl it was purchased for loved it!,1
"I think I would do it different if I ever have to it again. When trial fitting them I would mark the end of the first rail with a pencil, that way you won't put on loose or stretch them. Once stuck you cannot undo it.",1
"Really cool, small and LOUD alarm. Humidity function works well. REALLY BRIGHT - only downfall if there is one is no F only C on the temp (thankfully I know both)",1
"Very good at keeping mud, debris off the motor. Did not add sound dampening as others have suggested and did not realize too much of an increase in sound. Very thick aluminum. I'm confident this can take some pretty good hits.",1
Smooth and easy to operate. It goes down very low and can go high enough for a 6' person to comfortably groom. Appears to be very solid and we'll made - does not shake at all.,1
"I really enjoyed this book. I thought there would be the telling of horrible treatment by whites, and, indeed, there was some. There was also a deep, personal truth that needed telling and that was the surprise for me. I think the author a very brave man for this. I'd like to thank him for sharing. I wish every book could be this way: an intimate baring of the soul, showing our common humanity.",1
"It even has a dot on the front to show u where to apply pressure to make it stick to your bathroom wall. This item is convenient and the suction works really well, better than all the other travel bottles ive tried.",1
Easy to install. Plug and play. Will make a huge difference riding at night.,1
"Love, love, love this! Made cutting my diamonds and triangles a breeze and corners were sharp and precise!",1
The price is cheaper than others. Material is quality. I have used for over 6 months without any issues. Recommended to buy this brand,1
I enjoy all the fragrances and the assortment is great. The only thing I don’t like is that nowhere does it tell me if they are natural or synthetic.,1
"It might not be something you should use by itself, there needs to be a stretch and strengthening routine coupled to it, but I will say, that I have been suffering from low back pain, from a bulging disc, and this brace takes a lot of pressure away from my discs by modifying my posture. I can stand for longer, I can sit for longer, and I don’t even feel the constant presence of pain in the area while I wear it. Even though this targets my upper back and shoulders, it has provided great relief to my lower back. It didn’t solve my issue, but it helps a lot.",1
I bought this for my german shepherd. It's been great. It was much gentler than a standard collar when he was learning to walk on a leash.,1
This item was and is just right.,1
Worked fine for what I needed it for. Had an expensive set I bought several years ago but lacked 2 sizes smaller that i needed . Cost less to buy the whole set than the single sockets.,1
ordered 3 of these books and shes read them all,1
"Perfect size for espresso. Well packaged, very durable, highly recommended.",1
"Perfect, came with everything needed. God quality and fit perfectly. Much less then original brand.",1
Love that they last and stretch being I cut clients of all sizes,1
"Reformatted to NTFS, copied an mp4 and played the file. Works fine. Looks durable. I'm satisfied.",1
"Worked as advertised, dash surface any type or angle. Very satisfied.",1
This worked perfectly for a backless dress. I’m so glad I picked this one!,1
"I bought this for my son, he loved it! Easy to set up and get going, amazingly good picture quality. You can see clearly see moon details.",1
It was very easy to install on my laptop.,1
"I totally love this cover! It completely changed the look of my rustic cabin-looking futon. The futon itself is very well made and solid wood but the cover was old and ugly. This cover fit perfectly and it's super easy to put on. I did have my husband help on the side because the mattress was heavy, but otherwise the cover zips really fast. High quality zipper. The material is linen so perfect for kids and houses with pets. Not super soft but when people stay over I put sheets over it anyways so it's not a big deal.",1
Our 6 month old Daughter always needs a security blanket wherever we go. We bought these as backups and they have been so durable and they are really cute too.,1
"My last case I RIP off the cover plastic to install temper glass but I messed up, this one I can RIP it off and install temper glass under, not recommended it was a lot of work, the case offer good protection, the part I like most is the imitation carbon fiber boarder around the back",1
They are ok except. The fitted pops off.,1
"The charger cables arrived neatly coiled in the mailer. 3 different lengths useful for different arrangements. The colored cables feel sturdily made, easy marking for which side faces up going into the connector. And all 3 cables were priced very inexpensively. Good stuff.",1
Much prettier in Person,1
"Super cute boots! Love them, great quality!",1
Works as expected. Ring terminals are smaller than the threaded connectors on a deep discharge battery. A little shorter than I expected which makes it hard to put in a battery box (though is the advertised length) I wish it was 4 or 5 inches longer for use in a battery box.,1
It keeps my phone safe. I like how is sitting in my hand very good quality. Amazing!!!,1
I've become the grill king of our family! I love this set. The gloves work great! Just what I was looking for. The meat tongs are nice and the meat thermometer works perfectly as well. Great grill kit and great value. Highly recommended.,1
I'm trying to get wedding ready and this is a huge help. It helps make me accountable everyday and it comes with some great tips too!,1
Our Parrot loves it and she climbs all over it to the top. My 12yr old and I put it together with minimum issue. Little hard on the top cuz I'm 5'4 and it requires a little muscle but my daughter is 5'7 and did the tall stuff.,1
I got it for my 1year old baby girl. Very good soft smooth on ears And won’t break easily for sure. And awesome color also lovely.,1
"We had these lights before that we had purchased from a home improvement store several years ago (about 3 years ago). They held up well in the Phoenix sun, and when we moved, we wanted some landscape lighting in our new home. Look forward to more years of enjoyment with these.",1
Really like the bottom lashes! Cute packaging and nice quality.,1
I bought these for a Nerf battle birthday party for my son. We put buckets of these bullets out on the battlefield and they worked great! Highly recommend!,1
A must read for all who are looking for transformation in their thinking. A great inspiration in moving from fear to freedom. Add to your library today!,1
"Easy install. My daughter loves it, since the first day she got it, she need to play it every single day.",1
Right size for my yard,1
Just what I was looking fore. Works great with my weed whacker.,1
Have not used at night yet,1
Great item. No scratches and easy to use and very convenient i would recommend this to other fitness proactive individuals,1
Fantastic buy! Computer arrived quickly and was well packaged. Everything looks and performs like new. I had a problem with a cable. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me out a new one. I can't say enough good things about about this purchase and this computer. I will definitely use them again.,1
"This item is great, and it arrived sooner than it said it would. Just in time for my sons birthday party!",1
"What a word! Thank you Yahweh for releasing this word in the earth through Mark. And Mark, thank you for your patience and obedience with what was given to you! This time is EXCITING to be in. On earth as it is in heaven!!",1
"It fits nice, but I'm not sure about the quality, at the end of the day you get what you pay for.",1
Works perfect on plane,1
"I like this product, make me feel comfortable. I can use it convenient. The price is very cheap.",1
"Great quality , works perfect",1
"Really nice stainless steel pop, works perfect, the only way to make popcorn, we love our Great Northern brand, Best deal out there thru Amazon",1
Can't wait for the next book to be published.,1
"I have 3 of these in my house so far. They are tiny, unobtrusive and work great with my SmartThings Hub. I use Scotch Command Strips in the small size to attach them where I want them. We have a 50 pound dog that sets them off, so I’ve had to be creative with tape to cover portions of the sensor.",1
"I finally found a glove that fits like a glove! Gloves I've purchased in the past just didn't seem to fit right. They were either to short, to tight or to big. This glove is the perfect fit. It's nice and snug and the wrist part actually comes down to my wrist and the magnetic marker is so handy to have there. I think I'll get a couple more of these while I can.",1
Exactly as pictured. Easy to use and looks great.,1
I love how the waist doesn't have an elastic band in them. I have a bad back and tight waist bands always make my back feel worse.These feel decent...although If they could make them just one size larger..and not just offer plus size....that would be even better for my back.,1

"This makes almost the whole series. Roman Nights will be the last one. Loved them all. Alaskan Nights was awesome. Met my expectations , hot SEAL hero, beautiful & feisty woman. Filled with intrigue, steamy romance & nail biting ending. Have read two other books of yours. Am looking forward to more.",1
In the picture it looks shorter than it is. It’s not a crop top!,1
"Amazing! It doesn't bleed through, the colours are really cute even though the pink isn't quite as light as I wanted, but still perfectly functional",1
Very good price for a nice quality bracelet. My sister loved her birthday present! She wears it everyday.,1
Very nice harness!! I think I got the wrong size but that’s my fault. It worked very good with my large dogs since they like to pull me every where it was a lot more comfortable for them.,1
This is a very good deal. The smart tags were easy to set up and the quality is great. I bought 4. I am very pleased with this purchase. Oh! They arrived quicker than estimated.,1
Takes awhile but it works.,1
These arrived in great time and look darling as part of the gift I’m making for friends and neighbors.,1
Amazing flavor with just the right amount of sweet!,1
We used this monitor and 2 cameras for 10 months without issue until it was dropped and stopped working. DB Power was able to replace it for free under warranty. Very happy with this product.,1
"Now that I know, the line in the base to line up the number of the roof pitch was near impossible for me to see with my not to good site. Now I found it after I finished 95% of the install process. All was great, except for that detail. It works just great, I'm sure it will help with the heat buildup. Please make a better mark in the base. I will probably never install another for the rest of my life. This was my first. I'm 65.",1
"Great water bottle, wish it was slightly larger just so I didn't have to refill as frequently. Works like a charm, you set up the alarms so it notifies you to drink. Once it goes off, you can simply open the lid and drink and the alarm will cease. Well made product, good quality and bpa free.",1
Bought as a gift and was well received.,1
Loved this!!! True to size and gorg!,1
My 12 yr old gets compliments everywhere he goes...especially when dad and brother are wearing coinciding condiment tshirts! The print is a great quality & the yellow is very bright!,1
Ive used this 5 times now. I love it. Its so much more comfortable then the one i got from walmart.,1
Great lights! Super bright! Way better than stock! Fit my 2002 ford ranger no problem! Love the led look! Had for about a year and only one bulb went out around 6 months i emailed them my order number and address they sent me a new bulb within 2 days! Works great ever since!! Great product for the money! Great customer service!,1
"I didn't really have high hopes for this dress as I was expecting more of a costume-like dress, but I pleasantly was surprised! It is really cute and the fabric is thicker than I was expecting which is nice. It is a little tight around the neck and the zipper does not seem to be the strongest, but I got several complements and would highly recommend this dress!",1
"Excellent read!! I absolutely loved the book!! I’ve adopted 4 Siamese cats from Siri over the years and everyone of them were absolute loves. Once you start to read this book, it’s hard to put down. Funny, witty and very entertaining!! Siri has gone above and beyond in her efforts to rescue cats (mainly Siamese)!!",1
I repeatedly order this product and this seller is the best.,1
"Very addicting, very fun! The only bad thing is that during the winter the game has consistent snow, and it's annoying",1
Easy install and feel taught and sturdy.,1
"I'm enjoying my Instant Pot cookbook. Have already tried two or three recipes, and they are great.",1
"I've always bought 2-stroke engine tools for use in the yard. I've had Echo, Toro, and Ryobi, (Home Depot junk, their carburetors are terrible) It doesn't take long for the 2-cycle engine to get harder and harder to start with more pulls. Right out of the box, with the 1st tank of gas (not the oil-gas mix like for 2 cycle engines,) the 4 cycle Makita started on the 1st pull and has been a delight to start every time I have used it since. What a delight it is to have a 4 cycle engine. Buy one if you need a new yard machine.",1
I like that the package came with mutiple bulbs. I use my himalayan salt lamp daily and these work well with them.,1
Love the jeans hope to get more. Thank you.,1
This is a very good not expensive reader. My husband was able to determine what’s wrong with my car and save me a lot of money on repairs.,1
"I store equipment in an old barn / shed and do not want rodents chewing wires / destroying other stuff. The old D-con pellets always worked well but when they went to bait blocks the mice just laughed and ignored them. While you must now buy a gigantic bucket, it is good to see that the pellets are still available. Yes, use common sense and do not put them out where kids or pets might find them but, unlike the blocks, these do work",1
These work great! Im a bartender so mine get a lot of use.So far the only issue ive had is the paint chipping off.,1
Comfy and yet fashionable. Perfect for just about any occasion.,1
Very nice. My Grand daughters love there chef bonnets and aprons.,1
They spill when they tip over but other than that they’re great. They’re the same size as advertised and don’t leak when you shake them if you hold down the top.,1
I bought this for my son who recently started classes at college. It has been perfect for all the things he needs to access while at school.we have no issues with the adapter and it has been great having additional ports.

Fits great kinda expensive but it’s good quality,1
"This is easy to use, great quality and fun too! My husband uses it on his 4 wheeler. He is really enjoying it.",1

"Very stylish, love the length!!",1
"My cousin has one for his kid, my daughter loves it. I got one for my back yard,but not easy to find a good spot to hang it. After i cut some trees, now its prefect. Having lots of fun with my daughter. Nice swing, easy to install.",1
"This is by far the best book about Fairy`s I have ever read. Great characters, very disruptive, colorful. I can actually visually see and feel like I am in Twilight, it is so well written. I got all the books when I got this one and hope they are all just as well written. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the fairy world.",1
I cannot chop my onions without this little thing these days.,1
Cheaper at the company Amazon is twice the price,1
"Very informative Halloween Recipes For Kids book. This book is just what I needed with great and delicious recipe ideas. I will make a gift for my mom on her birthday. Thanks, author!",1
My little girl loves these books! #3 has been one of our favorites so far!,1
I really like this rug. I used it for my entry when people walk in to protect the high traffic area. The quality is better than I expected and I’m very happy with this purchase!,1
It was perfect. Beautiful.,1
"Small, but very bright garage light. We have tried all kinds of different lights in our garage so we can work into the night on various projects. Took a chance with this one thinking there is no way it could be so bright, but it’s amazing. Quick and easy installation. You can also angle the lights so they don’t have to be directly down at all times. Very happy with this investment!",1
they are a good bargan,1
Easy to install. Looks good. Works well.,1
Lamp works perfectly for my chicks,1
You can feel the quality! Could not believe how nice these were compared to the ones I got for twice the price last time! I will buy again for sure.,1
They are large and very cute,1
"The book is very good, the transport process has some dramatic accidents, but the store is very patient to help me",1
"I was really happy to find a new toy that both my cats really love. They chase this toy and each other through the home taking turns batting and carrying the toy in their mouths. I've already purchased a second set since the first ones all disappeared quickly (i.e. that secret place where all loved cat toys finally end up). Anyway, they are pretty inexpensive so I don't mind buying more because it is so much fun watching them play.",1
"Great sunglasses!!! Bought another pair of sunglasses and they were broken wi a week. These are durable, look good, great quality.",1
"The Marino Avenue brand Men’s low cut socks are of good quality. I put them through one cycle of hot water washing and drying and they stood up to the challenge. What I like best is the color choices on the socks. The green, yellow, red, and black one is my favorite combo.",1
"Just received it and so far so good. No issues, did a great job. For a family on a budget trying to waste as least food as possible, it is a great investment and it was very affordable too.",1
"quality canvas fabric. constantly falls off my shoulder, so I wear it crossbody",1
"This is a great product considering that I'm always losing my Microsoft pen, at $60-$80 a pop. Also, bright colors so easy to spot in a dark restaurant. Also, fatter barrel is a better fit for my fat fingers. No magnet, so forced to keep in a safe place, eg, my shirt pocket. And the battery cap is so much easier to handle than the Microsoft. I just wish it had a pocket clip. And caveat, I don't use the fancy multiple pressure levels, etc, fine artwork.",1
A really nice razor . Gives a close shave. The battery lasts a long time but you cannot shave while it is charging.,1
"I bought 40 of these tiles they are perfect ,good quality,heavy and work well in the winter. Would definitely buy again",1
Love this musical.. I've watched it so many times when I was young and now that I have a 10 yr old we watch it all the time together.,1
Super cute shoes! Fit true to size and way more comfortable than I expected! I was able to walk around the Las Vegas strip for about 4 hours in these with no problem.,1
"This is a very helpful book. Easy to understand and follow. Much rather follow these steps than take prescription meds. There used to be an app that worked as a daily checklist from the books suggestions, but now I cannot find the app anymore. Hope it comes back or gets updated.",1
"Loved this movie!! The purpose discovered for stepping outside of our own comfortable, yet complicated lives, to see the perspective of someone else..and in this movie, it is a homeless man. People are just people lesson that works well for these characters as they pass from the fear of stereotypes to finding the hearts of one another and how perfect the title becomes! Great movie!",1
"It is really nice to have my favorite sugar alternative packaged in little take along packets! I LOVE swerve, and it is so convenient to have these to throw in my purse for dining out, or to use at a friend’s house. While they are a bit pricey, I cannot stand Equal or the pink stuff in my iced tea. Swerve or nothing, so i am thrilled to have my sweetener on the go!",1
Perfect for the new college semester!,1
love the size the quality the easy to follow instruction needed it to charge shipping cost,1
Good quality and price.,1
The dress fits perfect! It’s a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.,1
Works as advertised and lasts 1 to 3 weeks before reapplying.,1
At first I thought I wouldn't like this wallet...but I was wrong...I like it alot,1
satisfied with purchase,1
"Lite and easy to use, folds with ease and can be stored in the back seat, but the elastic which holds the shade closed failed within two weeks. Really didn't expect it to last much longer anyway. The price was good so likely will buy again next year.",1
Works great for my use.,1
Great hold and strength on the magnet. Can be easily maneuvered to fit your needs for holding curtains back.,1
Amazing how these work.....,1
Works perfectly. Only criticism might be that the OD doesn’t match so it’s very apparent that an adapter is being used but glad to be able to use old attachments!,1
Bought this for my wife .she is a school teacher and uses this to bring her work home and back to school . Works great,1
Google maps took us up a road that became to narrow to turn around with a drop off on one side and a rock face on the other. Could not turn around or back down due to snow and ice. These chains saved our butts. Super easy to install and remove. Worked like charm getting us safely back down. Absolutely recommend.,1
Came as expected and upgraded hangers from smaller ones- Would definitely order again.,1
"Exquisite packaging, have USB C Adapter, my android, apple's old and new interface can be solved by one wire. It's great.",1
These are hard to find. Checked all of my local 'big box' stores and local hardware stores and could not find any locally. Tried the magnetic ones and these work much better.,1
They were exactly what I was looking for.,1
Absolutely love the quality and look of the dress! Very happy!,1
"I recommend this product more than any other case. I even shot it with a CO2 .177 BB gun and it didn’t even go through, As you can see in picture.",1
Love this coverup! It’s super thin and very boho!! Always getting compliments on it!,1
"this is a great book for parents who want to maximize their kids health but not lose the flavor and fun of food. spices are not spicy, they’re health boosting and delicious. i love spice momma’s creative recipes and can’t wait for more from her.",1

Very nice. Looks good in my car. It came in fast. The material is good. I'd buy it again.,1
I love it. I am doing paint with diamonds and I have a hard time seeing the symbols and this makes it so much easier,1
"Unlike the original decaf from Senseo, this packaging from Europe contains decaf coffee pods that are almost indistinguishable from the regular caffeinated coffee. Recommend.",1
I was amazed how good it works. That being said if you forget to put it on you will sweat like you did before. Would recommend to everyone.,1
Love the case for my Amazon Fire 7. Makes my Fire easier to use as well as protects it.,1
"Love it! Arrived as stated! Fast service! All the straps, tie downs, and blind come with the Liberator Wedge/Ramp Combo. Highly recommended!",1
Bought as gifts and me. we all love how this really cleans our electronics and my glasses,1
Awesome tool for Toyota/Lexus cartridge filter. Way less messy than using the plastic items that come with the filters to drain the oil from the cartridge. The flow doesn’t start until you turn the knurled handle after having threading it into the bottom of the cartridge. Clear tubing is handy to direct the oil into a pan or directly into a recycling container.,1
Fit perfectly into my coach tote! Makes the order very organized and easy to find items. I love it and will buy it in diff colors for other handbags!,1
"These are not the official Sonicare replacement brushes, but they fit great on my toothbrush. They are not very different than the original, besides having slightly rougher bristles. This is a great value product.",1
Works like a new one for a faction of the price!,1
"I am not sleep on the surface, but it still very comfortable.",1
I bought it to replace my Lenovo Yoga tablet - I wanted a smaller computing device for travel. I paired it with an iClever wireless folding keyboard and my Lenovo blue tooth mouse/pointer and it is working great! good size for surfing and for book reading and that is what I was after. The keyboard and mouse pair right up and work well. Some apps don't support spell check w the keyboard purchased 128gb memory - that should be just fine. I can even get a SIM card for it. It also does split screen for multi tasking. Lenovo makes quality stuff,1
"This is THE BEST mascara I have found. I live in south Florida and this stays on through humidity, rain, everything and NO clumping or smudging. It's buildable and really easy to remove. LOVE IT!",1
"Super cute, exactly as described, very well made",1
I bought this Handle pull as I had some already but needed some more and found them on Amazon. I am very pleased with the handle Pull as they are exactly like the ones I already had. They are very sturdy and very stylish as well. The price was just what I was looking for. I would buy them again if I happen to need more. Great service and very prompt arrival. And yes I would recommend to my friends to buy them.,1
"Storage of boots in my coat closet was a mess! This fit the bill! The 2 tiered rack has enough room for snow boots to fit on either tier, it's made of a heavy duty plastic & was a snap to assemble. Now boots are not all over the bottom of my closet & I have enough room for my 2 vacuums with room to spare.",1
Very nice looking. Nice feel to handle. Daughter loved it. May have to obtain one myself.,1
It was so adorable and me and my friend loved them! This is a great product,1
Arrived in time however the product do not numb your throat with one spray and I’m not sure if I should spray until it’s numb (direction states 1 spray),1
Awesome wrenches well with the money. Just as good if not better than my matco and snap on wrench sets,1
It genuinely makes your teeth white and is natural so would highly recommend this to anyone looking for natural whitener!,1
"works great, wanted the specialty blades.",1
"Is really easy to fold and take with you, i love it",1
Dropped my phone on the concrete today it hit on the top left corner and my phone is still perfect. There’s barely a scratch on the case just a little rough spot. Very satisfied,1
"Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the ""hot weather"" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I.",1
Great read. Opened my eyes to things I had never heard about this parable. Highly recommend to anyone who has ever heard a sermon on this topic.,1
plush My wife ended up buying 2 more,1
"I love them and my daughter is doing great using them, she has problem wit acid reflux and does alot better wit these bottles",1
"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970. In my opinion this was his best performance of his career. Later, I read the book. I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers. They really followed the book. As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God."" She pays a heavy price for justice. The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely. And every actor was totally believable in his/her part. An incredible work of art.",1
It's nice to be able to read a good mystery without the profanity and elicit sex most novels peddle to sell their books!,1
The colors are great and very versatile. I love the half moon style. I am extremely happy with this purchase!,1
Awesome book that is straightforward and to the point. Very useful information and a great straight point for anyone interested in this topic.,1
Great little plush owl.,1
"It's amazing,worked right out of the box with a simple installation of Bluetooth connection.A great value for the money. Very easy to use.",1
"This is a great toiletry bag. I got this for my husband since he's been using the same old raggedy bag since we met. Between going to the gym and traveling, it saw its fair share of abuse. I got him this bag just for traveling and he likes it a lot. It is attractive and holds everything he needs quite nicely. High quality for an excellent price. Highly recommend!!!",1
They were beautiful and worked great for the agape items I needed them for.,1
This is great product love the sound and quality of it !!!,1
Just as advertised. Quick shipping.,1
I received my bluetooth headset and it was used for listening to music only and occasional phone calls.sound quality is great and its comfortable to use.i used it's all day battery life is about 8 to 10 hours.it takes 1.5 hours to charge. It came in a small case with extra ear pieces and cushions. Good buy.,1
Love ! Looks adorable on my yorkie. He's 6 pounds and I got the medium he normally wares a small in clothing but I'm glad i sized up after ready the reviews. Going to order another one I attached photos so you can see he also can use the bathroom in it with no problem keeps him warm for the winters in NYC !,1
"I bought this book to read during a road trip. I loved it, couldn't put it down! Suspenseful, keeps you on the edge of your seat! Perfect summer read.",1
GREAT for my gun cleaning efforts. Scent isn't at all offensive. I think you would be pleased in any penetrating oil type usage--it works well on my folding ladder that was beginning to give me real trouble with folding.,1
I am 44 years old and I am a size 10-12 with a bra size of 36D. The XL was a perfect fit. It has plenty of support on the top and covers the bottom perfectly. I wanted a swimsuit that was cute and still covered me. But I didn’t want to look like an old lady! This swimsuit is perfect and the quality is great. This was my first swimsuit purchase online and is a winner!!,1
Good product especially for the price,1
Excellent quality for a reasonable price.,1
This album is the best I have heard in years. Highly Recommend,1
"I've been drinking this before my morning workouts and I've noticed that not only do I have more energy during my workouts, but also throughout the day. I highly recommend this product.",1
Great product. Very satisfied with my purchase.,1
I ordered this to decorate for autumn at my office at work. It's excellent. It's light-weight vinyl so it cuts easily if you need to make it shorter and it's easy to hang with just a few pieces of tape. The colors are vibrant and we got a lot of positive feedback from co-workers. I plan to buy more for other seasons!,1
If what you need is something for few tools you’re just gonna throw in the truck or your trunk it’s perfect.,1
I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author's next book.,1
Nice inexpensive headphones that are fairly comfortable and the volume can be adjusted on the wire. Easy to plug in to computer and play. Quick delivery!,1
This product really works. You just have to file the top clear coat. But really it’s the best way to remove gel without ruining your nails. I’ve ordered two bottles and they both came within two weeks.,1
Great value. I thought 3mil would be flimsy but it is not. Good for storing things.,1
I live in the country and can see far away.,1
Soft and perfect for our 1 year old.,1
"This is a WELL TOLD Romance that spans an ocean from England to America. Lots of description of the places you will visit as you read. Well developed characters, I especially like the characters of the Duke of Bancroft, Amelia, Anna, Jake and Jonathan. Nice surprises at the ending, and a clean read. Highly recommend this as all of her books have unique story lines.",1
"All the subjects of this book are very delicate, touchy. They are definitely subjects that need to be addressed and this author, Deborah Rainey, does it in a Godly way. Made me stop and think about my attitudes. God does work all things out for His glory if we will just trust Him.",1
"Michener the philosopher of the 20th Century clothed as a novelist. In an engaging style, tantalizingly follows the life of a Jew, an Arab, and an American Catholic at an archeological dig in Israel to tell the painful history of modern Judaism. Somehow he finds hope for both Israel, Jew, Arab, and in an amazing way Palestine.",1
"These came in a convenient carry bag with all accessories, including handles and ankle strap. They work great, offer good resistance, and I am happy with the purchase.",1
I love this band for my apple watch because it is easily adjustable and goes with so many different outfits. I got the rose gold. I work in the dental field so my wrists act up sometimes and it is super easy to adjust this band when need be. I highly recommend it!,1
This game brings back gaming memories!!,1
Very breathable and easy to put on.,1
"This is even sexier than the pic! It has good control and is smooth under all my clothes! It's also comfortable and I'm able to easily wear it all day, it doesn't roll down either!",1
"BEST NO SHOW SOCK EVER! Period, soft, NEVER slips, and is a slightly thick sock. Not to thick though, perfect for running shoes too!",1
"My hair is almost 30 inches long and it is so soft and healthy that I just cannot do my hair like other women can so this is a great way of being able to hold my professional job while looking professional. Because let's face it, we still live in a world that corporate/professional positions still view prim and proper as a means for being professional in appearance even though how I look has nothing to do with my work performance! This is perfect <3",1
Very handy for when the common cold has gotten the worst of you. Bought this for my wife and she loves it. Sometimes she puts essential oils in the water which adds to a pleasant scent.,1
High quality product. I prefer the citrate formula over other types of magnesium,1
This product is really slick - one stop shopping for all my connectivity needs. I love just throwing this and my laptops tiny power adapter in my go bag and being prepared to work on a big 4k display or grab photos from my camera. The only odd thing I experienced (and I’ve experienced this on all 4 usb-c hubs I’ve tried from different brands) is that mac’s apparently can’t tell the difference between multiples of the same monitor (so my mac outputs the same video to all identical monitors connected to the hub whether by HDMI and/or VGA). But if I use 2 separate hubs/adapters or 2 different models of monitor then the mac properly outputs to the displays individually.,1
"Perfect chairs for my home office! I wanted the swivel and no wheels. Reasonably comfortable, seat cushion is a bit like memory foam... great modern look. Easy to put the base on... four screws, and came with the tool.",1
Granddaughter really likes it for her volleyball. well constructed and nice way to carry ball.,1
"Great ideas in one device. One of those devices you pray you’ll never need, but I’m pretty sure are up for the task.",1
"Cutest sunglasses, I get lots of compliments. The stripe feature is so darling and the price was too good to pass up.",1
The light was easily assembled.... I had it up in about 15 minutes. Powered it up and I was in business. It has been running about a week or so and no problems to date.,1
Love them. have to turn off when not in use tho,1
bought for my young adult son and he loves it. So glad it wasn't fitted at the waist. the print he digs especially with the contrasting cuff color.,1
"S.M. Pratt, I really enjoyed this book. It is different and sexy as all. Cannot wait to start the next chapter. The characters are immensely sexy and this take on writing this genre is refreshing. Wish I could meet a pilot like that! YUMM.",1
Works as it says it will!,1
Recently upgraded my kids from Fire & kids Editions to Fire 8 HD's. While I really like the durability of the kids cases Amazon offers I don't want to buy two of them at 30 dollars a piece. These are considerably cheaper and offer pretty good protection. The are of course slimmer than the Amazon cases but offer really good protection.,1
Great bang for the buck!,1
"Works well, was great for my Injustice 2 Harley Quinn cosplay",1
"The watch band is great. It fits well, good quality and looks. I plan to buy more in other colors.",1
I like these 3mm size. They have just a bit more substance. They are plenty strong.,1
"I liked that Lee Strobel talked to people who had experienced miracles and did not write about them. I have read most of his “The Case For” books. They were all good, but this was the best.",1
Holy Crap what a Cliffy! Loved this book from beginning to end and is my absolute favorite so far! Can’t wait for book 4!,1
It’s a great product. Smells good and does the job. I wish they had refills without having to buy the dispenser again- but I haven’t seen any.,1
It arrived early than expected. Its beautiful and my husband was very happy with it.,1
Love the color and the application brush makes it so easy to apply perfectly.,1
I cant believe how easy to install these steps were. We absolutely love them. I wish I had known about them sooner.,1
Works to protect phone. Clear plastic allows me to still use most of the functions especially taking photos. It does not seem to affect the quality of the photos too much.,1
Was exactly what I needed!!!,1
I love scarves!! This is a goodie. The colors are rich. I plan to wear it with a black coat when I accessorize with blue.,1
God loved them they were hot together like he said his half of a whole his Ying to his yang I loved everything about this book I hope X and Raven stay together and get only stronger together one isn’t the other without the other they need each other loved this book it is dark but smoking,1
Air war as it actually was.,1
Love these lights. So much brighter than my other ones. My other ones barely shine far enough for me to see in front of me these are awesome,1
When I have a sugar craving I eat these to stay compliant with my clean eating plan!,1
"This book is just a delight to read! It’s a lighthearted tale of a zany and improbable quest by three headstrong and spirited heroines that will have you chuckling and laughing out loud. Even the bad guy is improbably evil and kills the chuckles when we meet him. Don’t worry! This is a Romance and all is well in the end, which is why I love Romances!",1
"Very nice straightener. Heats up pretty fast. Straightens great and it's a round barrel so it's really good for curling too! Leaves my hair soft, smooth, and shiny! I've had absolutely no issues so far. I'm loving it! Very happy I found this.",1
"Somehow a $30 swimsuit off of Amazon is super cute and fits great! I just had a baby and my boobs are huge, but this covered me and I felt super supported in it. It’s a great suit!",1

Great product! No complaints!,1
Easy to install and keep my threadripper nice and cool!,1
"Seriously the fluffiest towels! The color is beautiful, exactly as pictured, and they are bigger than I expected. Plus, I spent the same amount of money for these that I would have on the ""premium"" (non-organic) towels from Wal-Mart. You can't go wrong.",1
"Good speakers. I like the apple airbud style, but at a fraction of the cost. Great treble and bass sound, and comes with a cord that doesn't annoyingly tangle.",1
"Chair is really good for price! I have 6 children so I was looking for something not to expensive but good, this chair is really good comparing with others and good prices",1
Loved them. Use every day,1
Great lightweight large hoop earrings. I love them & recommend them. They were received quickly & were as expected.,1
"I purchased this to temporarily replace the Bluetooth function, which recently failed, on my 2015 Nissan Altima and it has been absolutely AWESOME. This is a great temporary fix until I decide on how I want to proceed with repairing the Bluetooth function through the actual radio. I HIGHLY recommend this product.",1
What a really great set of acrylics. My daughter has been painting with them since they came in. The colors come in a wide range of vibrant colors that have a smooth consistency. These paints are packed in aluminum tubes which allows the paint to not dry or crack over time.,1
"My husband loved it! He works HVAC and on his cars and bikes on his off time, so was constantly looking for something he didn’t have to worry about getting caught on something or about the ring getting scratched.",1
These make it really easy to use your small keyboard on your phone. Would recommend to everyone.,1
My daughter got this today for Christmas and loved it! She thought it was a lunch box at first and honestly I think it would make a great lunch box.,1
"Definitely amazing cookbook! A collection of recipes intended for a living alone or two. So, there's no way to fast food store, just start a healthy living with this slow cooker for two cookbook.",1
Excellent product a d price,1
this ck boxer brief is so soft and comfortable,1
"I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it's adjustable.",1
This product worked just as designed and was very easy to install.The setup is so simple for each load on the trailer.I would def recommend this item for anyone needing a break controller.,1
Lucas. This book was interesting. I was surprised at how determined Lucas was to make Jasmine his. The issues Jasmine carried around kept her from having a relationship with any man. But Lucas wasn't taking no for an answer. I am glad she found out who her father was even though it was a shocker ! This book was a great read! *** I voluntarily read a Review Copy of this book. All opinions stated are solely my own and no one else’s. ***,1
I'm am using theses for my bow flex. Nice upgrade!!!!,1
"Works as stated. I have an older flat panel TV with only 1 HDMI input. With this device, I can send outputs from three sources to my TV: a cable box; a DVD player; and a ChromeCast device. Simply press the switch button to select the source of choice. Also, this box is very small; fits in the palm of your hand, so is easily hidden behind other equipment. I rarely give a five star review, but its justified in this case",1
Did not work for a mic on a headset for Xbox but the sound is all there!,1
"This stylish stainless steel blender bottle works great. My green powder blends so well. This bottle is easy to clean, easy to carry around, and fits properly in my car cup holder with a secure lid. Bottomline, this is a great quality blender bottle that doesn't sweat with ice tea. Such a great purchase.",1
Mouse ON/OFF button location could be located somewhere more feasible.,1
"HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE, HAPPY DANCE!!! This story is a rollercoaster ride of emotions. Here you have tragic events that ripped my heart out, then you have a swoon worthy romance that was sexy, sweet, and just made me believe in love, on to the nosey spiteful small town drama, heartbreak, and ending it all with a warm sweet feeling that I just didn't want to be over. Wyatt and Hannah are two of the most relatable characters that I have experienced this year. Out of all the books that I have read, these two rank pretty high in my memorable couples list. I just want more and more, I was so sad when I got to the end because I just wanted to keep their story going. This specific video review will be included in the October 2018 wrap-up. For other video book reviews check out my YouTube Channel: Steph's Rom Book Talk.",1
I realllllllly love this product i got it and it was amazing it was true to size (i got a medium) and looked great. The material was not cheap and i needed it asap and it was shipped fast that you 👏🏽,1
I finally took the opportunity to use my new hand blender today (twice!). It was great. Made an omelet at lunch and a shake at dinner.,1
"So funny, great for binge watching",1
This book was so amazing!! WOW!! This is my favorite book that I have read in such a long time. It is a great summer read and it has made me wish that I could be a Meade Creamery girl myself!! Siobhan is an awesome writer and I can’t wait to read more from her.,1
Love the humor and the stories. Very entertaining. BOL!!!,1
Love this mower cuts very well,1
Very good product I realy love it,1
Great boot for snow and rain,1
"Works just as well (if not better) than it's name-brand ""cousin"" at about 1/3rd of the price!",1
So surprised at how soft it was. Washes up wonderfully.,1
Love love love! So easy to use. Bought one for myself in pink and one for the boyfriend too,1
Love the pot Really like the copper on it,1
My favorite kitchen tool!!!,1
A must buy for any Home,1
I used two of them to stabilize 20 foot of waste line and they're doing the job perfectly so far. Very satisfied.,1
"Pretty easy to work with, the finished driveway looks very nice have to see over time how it lasts , Happy with the results .",1
"What a wonderful first book in a new series. I love all of Ms. Kennedy’s books and I eagerly one clicked this one. It has engaging characters, a strong storyline and hot encounters. I really enjoyed it.",1
We have enjoyed this tray. It lets my sons color and play with their small cars/construction vehicles while in the car. It also allows them to color and keep busy. It has a cup holder that is easier for my 2 1/2 year old to reach than the one that comes with his car seat. Easy to install and also take off when not in use.,1
Great spray bottle. The gentle mist makes it easy to wet my toddlers hair without it dripping and the magical prolonged light listing spray is just mind blowing.,1
"Works great, and the quality is superb.",1
Great on carpet. Just okay on hard floors. Bad at little bits of paper. I love it for my girls to vacuum the carpet. The handle height is adjustable for them to use and they find it so fun. Praise God!,1
This product is AWESOMENESS,1
I love these Capris so much that I bought 4 pairs. The high waist helps with tummy control where I have a lot around the waist but skinnier legs and these are perfect. Sometimes with high waist products they tend to roll but these do not and they make your ass look amazing. Highly recommended.,1
This is just what I needed to add to my porch railing to block out my neighbors window looking right into my house. I added silk roses and silk ivy! Its so pretty and no view of the neighbor! Excellent buy.,1
Used these on my wedding cake! Turned out beautiful!,1
I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed! So I didn’t have to return it! The fabric does NOT puff up. Looks brand new even after wash! VERY SOFT! Wrinkle free as noted!!! Very white after washing with plain blue Tide detergent. Will buy again!!! AND AGAIN!! THANK YOU!!!,1
I love the material of these gloves and that I can also use my phone with them on. Have already worn them a few times and love them!,1
I got these as a gift. I've always used Cuisinart Black Teflon for many years but I have to say that this set is absolutely fabulous! I've cooked with them a few times already and cleanup is so easy. Nothing sticks to them and since they can't be used in the dishwasher handwashing is and breeze. I really hope they hold up. Time will tell but ands of now I'm a satisfied customer.,1
Makes life so much easier having a garbage right at your fingertips while you're cooking by the sink,1
This is a neat toy. It is fun to play with. The track pieces snap together easily. It keeps kids entertained. It comes with dinosaurs. It is made very well.,1
Smells great and makes my hair so soft!,1
Grand daughter Loved it.,1
"This worked as expected and did not cost to much. Its a good replacement side view mirror, easy to install.",1
These stay in my hair and don't leave marks in my hair when I take them out.,1
Worked great took swimming in the ocean and it stayed dry.,1
I finally had time to sit down and read the instructions. It was very simple. I set it up last night. Worked great. I'm going to get another one to set up in the front room.,1
"I live in the city, where there's lots of independent stations, and I get 88 of them Lol! Most I can't use, but in Southern California I get 2, 4, 5, 7 but no 11 or 13. Defiantly a good deal.",1
"Quick shipping, Quality product, Perfect fit",1
"This sweatshirt changed my life. I wore this sweatshirt almost every single day from January 25th, 2017 up until last week or so when the hood fell off after almost a year of abuse. This sweatshirt has made me realize that the small things in life are the things that matter. Thank you Hanes, keep doing what you do. Love, Justin",1
unbelievable that it is so easy to use and so helpful for organization. will buy it again and will recommend to friends.,1
We have watched all of the Madagascar movies and I felt this was the best one. It was very entertaining and we’ve seen it many times and still enjoy it.,1
Exactly as described. Is not a generic mount. Made for specific camera only.,1
I have sensitive skin and prone to breakouts. I notice I start to look not so fresh when I forget to apply this toner daily.,1
These are a good value - sound is clear and headphones are light and comfortable. These are my second pair of same product,1
"This is the second one of these that I have purchased. It is an excellent platform for a foam or conventional mattress. It is totally sturdy, and looks nice. I highly recommend it. There are many frames out there that will cost you much more, but this does the trick.",1
"I got it setup and running today. So far I prefer this color of light over the pink grow lights I have. The pink grow lights(not this one) I have work really well but heat up a little. This one is much easier on the eyes and it still has red light colors. The aluminum is strong. It came a little bent but I was able to fix tht. It’s a very simple construction. I Iike how you can convert it from rectangular to square. It hasn’t been running long, but so far it hasn’t heated up a lot. If it doesn’t heat up a lot and can grow my plants well my review will stay a 5 star and I’ll get more for the rack I have.",1
Easy to clean. Great length for my toddler!,1
"I love the case. I got the burgundy and it looks and feels great! The only downside is that I have a dock to charge my AirPods, phone, and watch and the case doesn’t fit into the hole, so I have to take it on and off to charge my AirPods on the doc. Other than that it’s a great product.",1
Bot for my mother and she enjoyed it,1
I've been reading alot on an iPad and have been getting terrible neck and back aches. This thing is easy to assemble and quite compact when you want to put it away. I recommend to anyone reading on a device for long periods. It will literally save your neck :),1
Great price for FCC. I have used this oil with essential oils for rollers and it serves its purpose well. Light coconut scent. Would purchase again.,1
"I really enjoyed Sebastian. He's a true optimist that seeks out the good in everyone and everything, but he's also insightful. He sees Zane's standoffish behavior and knows that he's struggling with something painful. Sebastian offers a listening ear, friendship, and comfort. Zane is stewing in grief and there are moments when it overwhelms him. Sebastian shows up every time, just being a quiet presence. It was wonderful to watch these two so quickly fall, they take a bit to acknowledge their feelings. Lovely ending.",1
This is an amazing book! It's well thought-out and the concepts are clearly presented. It's a visual treat as well as being extremely informative. This is one of my favorite books! Please mark if you find my review helpful. Thank you so much!,1
"Love the gloves , but be,careful if you are allergic to nickel don't buy them they are made with nickel chloride which I am allergic very highly allergic to so that was the only downfall",1
This is a great movie about grace and forgiveness !,1
This unit was so easy to put together and once I put it on the pole on the roof I got 46 channels of HDTV time to cut the cable.,1
"Love the look of these! They look like real tiles! They really aren't too bad to install. Hardest part was peeling the backing off, but found it worked better to peel the tile off of the backing... if that makes sense!",1
Works great! Not loud.,1
Typical Carhartt quality....first rate! What an awesome company! Never owned a Carhartt product that disappointed...and there have been hundreds. My last Carhartt wallet lasted 15 years! What else was I going to buy?,1
This is an excellent budget ultrawide for developers. The screen splitting is really useful for CLI and debugging tools.,1
The item ordered came exactly as advertised. I highly recommend this vendor and would order from them again.,1
Nice product. Doesn’t smell or leave residue. Just shake spray and everything is dead.,1
I love this product for cleaning my phone Notepad and computer screens,1
never really knew if an acrylic platter could change the sound. but apparently it does,1
I needed this book a long time ago But the Lord has brought me to where I am now without these words and by his love.,1
"I use this bag to carry several Dewalt tools. Unlike costlier bags with multiple pockets, this bag has only one, which is exactly what I needed. Large, sturdy, heavy duty zipper... it's a great bag.",1
"This book is really easy to implement on a daily basis. I am a very busy mom with three kids, having a book like this helps me take care of myself! The instructions are easy to follow and it is as the author said, 5 poses in 5 minutes, you do not need more time to feel the full benefit of the yoga poses.",1
My kids love their bags! Carry them everywhere and are very durable.,1
She loved very much as a birthday gift and also said it will come in handy for all kinds of outings.,1
"Assembly started with exceptionally good quality materials, fasteners and a simple but perfectly sufficient graphic instruction sheet (1, one-sided!). It went together in a little over an hour, but despite considerable experience assembling furniture, I was being very careful because it is a beautiful piece of furniture. Although it is heavy, if you leave the doors and shelves off until you situate it where you want, one person can lift it and move it. The double layer packaging does exactly what it was designed for - protecting the contents. I will buy from this dealer and this manufacturer again.",1
Once I installed dimmable bulbs this worked great! No flicker,1
Solid value for the money. I’ve yet to have a problem with the first pair I bought. Buying a second for my second box.,1
My puppies loved it!,1
"It’s beautiful than I expected. Hopefully the magnetic therapy works too. I have only wore it for a couple of days, so it’s too early to say.",1
I liked the taste. Could eat it right out of the jar. But it's too expensive for such a small amount.,1
Loved these so much we bought a 2nd set,1
Never get tired of this genre. Top of the line story and writing.,1
"Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark.",1
"It really does work. I moved into an apartment, before Bengal I sprayed with another spray. I’ve seen a couple of roaches, exterminator came around & exterminated the whole building, saw a couple more. I ordered & sprayed Bengal & I have not seen any. It really do work.",1
"It's still early, but so far the scales seems like a good product. It is very modern-looking. My wife got back from the Dr.'s office and said their scale read 3+ pounds lighter than ours....so time to shop. Ours was old....so maybe lost some degree of accuracy. This INEVIFIT seems to be accurate. Time will tell. We like it. Hard to give products a ""5"" when they are still in the ""testing"" phase.....and there is ALWAYS room for improvement. I don't really like to have to use 4 AAA batteries, but I'll get over it. We'll see how long they last.",1
I’ve used this face mask a few times now and it works great it also had a pleasant smell will buy it again,1
Great price. Good quality.,1
Fits my 2016 F150 XLT great. Now I dont have to listen to it hitting side to side while driving anymore.,1
Just what I needed! Perfect for western theme party.,1
