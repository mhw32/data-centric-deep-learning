Mountain bike is a relatively new sport that emerged in the 1970s, when cyclists in California decided to take their bikes off-road and explore new trails. In the 1990s, the first mountain bikes that could withstand the impact of rougher terrain were created, and the hobby subsequently took off, quickly becoming a sport in its own right. The first informal competitions took place in the late 1970s before the first official world championships were held in the 1990s.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

There are two cross-country mountain bike events: one for women and one for men. Riders set off from the same starting line and contest multiple laps around a loop on mountainous, rough terrain that tests their technique, endurance, and stamina.

Races feature a mass start and, in general, multiple laps. Riders take one to two hours to complete an intense course full of twists and turns, covering tens of kilometres during the event.

## Olympic History

Mountain bike made its Olympic debut 100 years after track cycling and road cycling at the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, with individual races for men and women. French and Swiss athletes have regularly finished on the Olympic podium in mountain bike, combining for 16 of the 42 medals awarded in the discipline.
