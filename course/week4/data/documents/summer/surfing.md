Paris 2024's surfing events will take place over four days in a 10-day window, from 27 July to 5 August.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

Surfers perform manoeuvers and tricks on a wave that are scored by five judges based on the variety, type and difficulty of the tricks. Surfers are also judged on their speed, power and flow (the way in which a surfer seamlessly connects their moves from one to the next). Shortboards are the surfboards of choice for the Olympics. Smaller than longboards, shortboards are faster and more manoeuvrable, which makes them the ideal board for performing spectacular tricks.

## Olympic History

In the 1920s, surfing fans including three-time Olympic swimming freestyle champion and native Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku began campaigning for the sport to be added to the Olympic programme. Many years later, surfing finally made it onto the Olympic programme for the Tokyo 2020 Games, and will return for Paris 2024; the legendary surfing spot Teahupoâ€™o in Tahiti has been selected as the venue for the surfing competition.
