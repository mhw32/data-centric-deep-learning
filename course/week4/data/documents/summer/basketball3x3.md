Considered to be the number one urban sport in the world, 3X3 basketball has its roots in street basketball—a creative variation of the indoor game with a less formal structure. Evolving from outdoor courts to the Olympic Games, 3X3 basketball has been structured over the years by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), the governing body responsible for developing basketball. The introduction of events such as the 3X3 World Tour and the 3X3 Superleague in France reflects the soaring popularity of this young urban sport, played in an electric atmosphere whipped up by a DJ and their music.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

3X3 basketball is played on one half of a basketball court where two teams of three players compete. Both teams attack and defend the same hoop, depending on who has possession of the ball. The winner is the team with the highest score at the end of 10 minutes or the first team to reach 21 points. The three‑point line in conventional basketball serves as the two-point line in 3X3 basketball, with shots made outside the line earning two points and those inside it one.

Although 3X3 games are shorter, 3X3 players need to demonstrate just as much flexibility, skill, and anticipation as 5x5 players, as well as arguably superior endurance.

## Olympic History

3X3 basketball featured at the Singapore 2010 Youth Olympic Games, Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympic Games, and the Buenos Aires 2018 Youth Olympic Games, drawing huge crowds at all three competitions. In 2017, on the back of this young sport’s resounding success, the IOC announced its decision to include 3X3 basketball as part of the Olympic programme at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, where the first-ever 3X3 Olympic titles were won. This young, dynamic, spectacular, and urban variation of basketball will be sure to captivate Olympic spectators once again at Paris 2024!
