Trampolining was invented in 1934 by American gymnast George Nissen who, after watching trapeze acrobats perform tricks while bouncing off safety nets, built the first prototype trampoline to recreate their acrobatics. Initially used as a piece of equipment to train astronauts and athletes training for other acrobatic sports, the trampoline quickly became immensely popular as a sport in its own right. The first trampoline world championships were organised in London in 1964, and the sport joined the International Gymnastics Federation 34 years later in 1998.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

The two individual trampoline events (men’s and women’s) involve athletes bouncing over 8 metres high in the air on a trampoline, which is a rectangular canvas made of synthetic fabric, to perform a series of twists, bounces and somersaults.

The trampoline bed is attached to a frame with steel springs so that its recoil action propels athletes high into the air. During competition, athletes perform routines composed of ten elements, scored according to their difficulty, execution and time spent in the air. The sport is highly technical and requires absolute precision.

## Olympic History

Trampolining made its first appearance at the 2000 Games in Sydney, with men’s and women’s competitions. The number of events (two) has remained unchanged since then. Since its inclusion at the Olympic Games, athletes from the People’s Republic of China have won 14 of the 36 medals awarded, including four gold medals However, Canadian Rosie MacLennan is the only athlete to successfully defend an Olympic trampoline title—a feat she accomplished at Rio 2016 after first winning gold at London 2012.
