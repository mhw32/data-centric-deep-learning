The precursor to tennis was the “jeu de paume,” or “game of the hand,” which originated in France in the 11th century. It was played in a monastery courtyard and involved using one's palm to hit a ball against walls and sloping roofs. Tennis, as we know it today, was developed in 19th-century England. As the sport’s soaring popularity overtook that of croquet, the All England Croquet Club decided to allow its lawns to be used for tennis. Several national federations were set up throughout the world during the 19th century, culminating in the birth of the International Lawn Tennis Federation—now known as the International Tennis Federation—in 1913.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

Olympic tennis consists of events in men’s and women’s singles, and men’s, women’s and mixed doubles. Singles matches are played to the best of three sets with a standard tie-break in every set, including the final set.

## Olympic History

Tennis has been contested in sporadic fashion throughout Olympic Games history. It first featured at the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896, but was withdrawn from the programme after the 1924 Olympic Games due to disputes between the International Lawn Tennis Federation and the International Olympic Committee over how to define amateur players. Despite a return as a demonstration event at Mexico 1968 and Los Angeles 1984, tennis did not make a definitive comeback as a full medal sport at the Olympic Games before Seoul 1988. Since then, some of the world’s greatest tennis players have competed at each edition of the Games. In recent years, the gold medal has been taken home by several superstars, including Rafael Nadal, Olympic champion in the singles event in 2008 and doubles in 2016; Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, Olympic doubles champions in 2008; and Serena and Venus Williams, who have won eight Olympic titles between them.
