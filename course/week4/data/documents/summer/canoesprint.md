For centuries, canoes were used as a means of transport (as well as a useful tool for hunting and fishing) in North America, Siberia, and Greenland. The first recorded competitive canoe sprint race took place at the British Royal Canoe Club in 1869.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

Canoe and kayak races feature on the Olympic Games programme, each with its own specific rules. Canoeists kneel in the boat and use a single-blade paddle on one side at a time, whereas kayakers are seated and use a double-bladed paddle.

Canoe sprint races take place on flatwater and feature sprints over various distances (women’s races are either over 200m or 500m, while men’s races are either 500m or 1000m), with one, two or four athletes per boat.

## Olympic History

Canoe sprint became an Olympic medal discipline at the Berlin 1936 Olympic Games, after previously featuring as a demonstration event at the Paris 1924 Olympic Games.
