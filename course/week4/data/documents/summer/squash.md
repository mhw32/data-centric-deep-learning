Squash is a racket sport usually played by two people on a rectangular court enclosed by four walls. The floor is made of hardwood with walls in professional competition constructed from safety glass to enable spectators to watch the action.

Squash balls are made of rubber and tend to have little bounce. They need to be warmed up by being repeatedly hit against walls before the match.

## By whom, where and when was Squash invented?

Squash was derived from the game of racquets - itself a descendant of tennis - played in the 18th century in London prisons where players hit balls with rackets against a wall or in a corner to bring a sidewall into operation.

In the mid-19th century, following the advent of the vulcanisation of rubber, students at English boysâ€™ boarding school Harrow replaced the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball which travelled slower.

Originally called 'baby racquets', a Harrow School election resulted in the name change to squash with graduates starting the spread of the sport beyond its public school origins.

## What are the rules of Squash?

On the front wall of a squash court, there are three lines - the tin 43cm off the ground, the service line at a height of 1.78m, and the out line at 4.57m which slopes down on the side walls to 2.13m on the back wall.

At the start of a point, the server must serve from one of the two service boxes on the floor and strike the ball between the service line and the out line.

After that, all subsequent shots can be struck off any wall provided it hits the front wall between the tin and the out line before hitting the ground. The ball is only permitted to bounce once on the floor.

The winner of a rally receives a point and the next serve. The first player to 11 points - by two clear points - wins a game. The first player to three games takes the match.

## Squash and the Olympics

Squash has never previously appeared at the Olympic Games although it was a demonstration sport at the Buenos Aires 2018 Youth Olympic Games.

## Best Squash players to watch

Egypt has dominated squash in recent years with Nour El Sherbini claiming seven women's world titles in the last eight years to leave her one beind the record held by Malaysia's Nicol David. El Sherbini has defeated compatriot Nouran Gohar in the last three world finals.

Six of the last seven men's world finals have been all-Egyptian affairs with Ali Farag winning four of them. Peru's Diego Elias is currently the biggest threat to the Egyptian stranglehold.
