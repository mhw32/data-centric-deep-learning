BMX racing emerged from the motocross craze that took off in California in the 1960s, as youngsters began racing their bikes on improvised tracks all over the state. BMX began to develop into a proper sport in the early 1980s; in 1981 the International BMX Federation was founded, with the first BMX world championships following one year later. BMX was integrated into the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) in 1993, thereby clearing the first hurdle required to feature at the Olympic Games.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

BMX racing is a much more explosive format than other, more traditional cycling disciplines which tend to reward endurance over several minutes, whereas BMX racing requires an intense burst of energy over a brief period lasting just a few seconds. Sprint races are contested by a maximum of eight riders on a track packed with jumps, banked corners and obstacles, where the rider with the quickest reactions and fastest pace wins.

Riders launch themselves from a gate atop the eight-metre high start hill onto the 400m track, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h. Quick reactions and explosive power are essential to burst out of the gate at the front of the pack and hold on to the lead through to the finish line. The final race is often a thrilling spectacle that viewers watch with bated breath.

## Olympic History

In 2003, the International Olympic Committee made BMX an Olympic sport for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Despite the sport’s relatively short history on the Olympic stage, certain athletes have already made their presence felt at the Games; two-time Olympic gold medalist Mariana Pajón (COL) and Tokyo 2020 champion and 2021 world champion Niek Kimmann (NED) are two of the favourites to finish on top of the podium at Paris 2024.
