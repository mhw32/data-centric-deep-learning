Equestrian events originated in Ancient Greece, where it was thought that a perfect partnership was needed if rider and horse were to survive in battle. Dressage was therefore developed as a way of training horses for war. Equestrian events appeared at the ancient Olympic Games as chariot racing, which was a daring and exciting spectacle. The art of riding then fell into oblivion until its revival during the Renaissance. Dressage reached its peak with the creation of the world-famous Spanish Riding School in Vienna in 1729, which established the foundations of the modern discipline.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

Equestrian comprises three disciplines at the Games, with men and women competing on equal terms.

In the jumping discipline, riders and horses are timed as they jump over obstacles, with time penalties imposed for each obstacle toppled. Agility, technique and harmony between horse and rider are essential.

Dressage is the most advanced form of horse training, where horse and rider perform a series of artistic movements to music. Judges evaluate the ease and fluidity with which they move around the course.

The third discipline of eventing resembles an equestrian triathlon. It combines the two other events—jumping and dressage—with a third: cross-country, which consists of a long course combining solid and natural obstacles, drawing on the athletes’ endurance and experience. The horse and rider with the most versatile skills win the three events.

## Olympic History

Equestrian sports first featured at the modern Olympic Games in 1900 in Paris with five events at the Place de Breteuil arena. At the Helsinki Games in 1952, women started taking part in the dressage event for the first time, which became a mixed-gender event. Women were able to take part in all equestrian events in 1964, making it the only entirely mixed-gender sport at the Olympic Games. Medals are awarded to both individual competitors and teams.
