Bicycle Motocross (BMX) Freestyle was born out of the imagination of children and teenagers in California in the 1970s, who were inspired by the moves of BMX racers in the region. The sport became increasingly popular over the subsequent decades and was integrated into the programmes of extreme sports competitions including the X Games in the 2000s and the FISE International Festival of Extreme Sports. The first BMX Freestyle World Cup was organised by cycling’s world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), in 2016 as part of that year’s FISE.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

The BMX Freestyle competition will take place in an urban park where riders will perform as many tricks as possible in 60 seconds. They will be scored based on the difficulty of the tricks, the height of their jumps, and the creativity and style of their routines.

## Olympic History

BMX Freestyle got its first run out on the Olympic stage at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires. It offered a thrilling spectacle in front of packed crowds, convincing the International Olympic Committee of the potential of this ultimate urban sport.

BMX Freestyle returns for its second Olympic Games at Paris 2024 after making its competitive debut at Tokyo 2020.
