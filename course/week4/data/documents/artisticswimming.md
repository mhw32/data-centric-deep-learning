The sport of artistic swimming developed by combining water acrobatics with music. Although the first contests were organised for men, artistic swimming later became more associated with women. After a number of demonstrations in the US in the early 20th century, the discipline grew in popularity and the first competitions were organised.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympic Games, the sport consists of two events: a duet and a team competition. The duet events consist of a technical routine and a free routine. An acrobatic routine is added for the team event. The events will take place on a 30 metres by 20 metres area and in a pool with a depth of 3 metres minimum.

The routines are scored by judges who take several criteria into account: level of difficulty, synchronization, execution and artistic impression.

Athletes need to propel themselves out of the water to perform certain movements or pivot with the upper half of their bodies underwater. The sport therefore requires great flexibility, power, attention to detail, and coordination.

## Olympic History

Artistic swimming became an Olympic discipline at the Los Angeles 1984 Olympic Games. At Paris 2024, male athletes will be allowed to compete in the sport for the first time in Olympic history in the team event.

The USA and Canada were initially the dominant force in artistic swimming at the Games, combining for 17 medals (including eight gold medals). Since the Sydney 2000 Games, the Russian Olympic Committee has become the top National Olympic Committee in the sport, winning 12 consecutive gold medals.
