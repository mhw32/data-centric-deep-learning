Luge, derived from the French word "luge" meaning "sled," is a high-speed winter sport that combines elements of speed, skill and precision. Athletes race down an icy track lying feet first on their backs on a specialised sled, reaching top speeds of up to around 135km/h. With roots dating back centuries, luge has evolved into an exhilarating Olympic sport that captivates audiences worldwide.

## Swiss origins

The origins of luge can be traced back to the mountainous regions of Europe, where wooden sleds were used for transport. In the Swiss Alps during the late 19th century, luge as a competitive sport began to take shape. The first international race was held in Davos in 1883, with competitors racing along a 4km icy road between Davos and the village of Klosters.

## Olympic history

The sport gained international recognition in 1957 with the establishment of the International Luge Federation (FIL), which governs international luge competitions at the highest level. Luge made its Olympic debut at the 1964 Innsbruck Games, featuring men's singles, women's singles, and doubles events. Over the years, the Olympic programme has expanded to include men's and women's doubles events, as well as the thrilling team relay.

## Innovation and evolution

Luge continues to evolve, with advancements in technology, equipment and track design enhancing both safety and performance. Modern luge tracks feature challenging curves, banking and refrigeration systems to maintain optimal ice conditions. Athletes use specialised sleds and gear designed for maximum aerodynamics and control, pushing the boundaries of speed and precision.
