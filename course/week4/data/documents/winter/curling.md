Curling is a team sport played by two teams of either two or four players on a rectangular sheet of ice.

Its nickname, "the roaring game", originates from the rumbling sound the granite stones make when they travel across the ice.

## Brush

In curling, a brush is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone as it travels down the sheet. The action of sweeping reduces the friction between the stone and the ice and can decrease the amount the stone curls.

## Ice

For tournaments, the artificially created ice has its surface sprinkled with water droplets, which freeze into tiny bumps on the surface. Called "pebbled ice", this surface helps the stone's grip and leads to more consistent curling.

## Sheet

The curling sheet measures between 44.501m (146 feet) and 45.72m (150 feet) in length with a width between 4.42m (14 feet 6 inches) and 4.75m (15 feet 7 inches) with a target—or house—at either end.

## Shoes

Special curling shoes are common; shoes should grip the ice well. While shooting, extremely slippery surfaces such as Teflon are used on the sliding foot. Some are built into the shoes and others are strapped on over the shoes.

## Rock

Also known as a stone, a curling rock is made of rare, dense granite that is quarried on Scotland's Ailsa Craig. Each rock weighs no more than 19.96kg (44lbs) and no less than 17.24kg (38lbs). It is also polished.
