Wrestling is one of the oldest sports in human history—if not the oldest. Multiple sculptures, reliefs and cave drawings—some of which date to around 15,000 years ago—show wrestlers using various holds that are still used in the present-day sport. Wrestling was a key part of the ancient Olympic Games, where it was first contested in 708 BCE. Wrestling matches were organised as its own event in two disciplines (‘upright’ and ‘ground’ wrestling) and as part of the pentathlon.

Modern wrestling consists of two separate disciplines: Greco-Roman wrestling, a wrestling style based on the ancient sport, and freestyle wrestling, a more modern format.

## Brief Overview of the Rules

There are two Olympic wrestling disciplines, each with its own rules. In Greco-Roman wrestling, a competitor can only use his arms and upper body to attack his opponent above the waist. Freestyle wrestling is a much more open form of the sport in which competitors also use their legs and can hold opponents above or below the waist.

However, the objective is the same in both styles. Contested on a circular combat area, a bout consists of two three-minute periods. Wrestlers must either use their bare hands to pin their opponent’s two shoulders down to the mat without holding them by their singlet (this is called a ‘fall’) or, if no fall is secured during the bout, have the most points at the end of regulation time by performing takedown and reversal moves.

## Olympic History

Greco-Roman wrestling has been a blue-ribbon Olympic event ever since the first modern Games were held in Athens in 1896. It became a permanent fixture on the Olympic programme in 1908. Freestyle wrestling made its debut a few years later at the St. Louis 1904 Games and has featured on the Olympic programme ever since the Antwerp 1920 Games. Women’s freestyle wrestling has been on the Olympic programme since the Athens 2004 Games.

Athletes representing the Soviet Union have won 116 medals at the Games, including 62 golds. Team USA athletes have secured 142 medals (57 golds). Japan is the most successful nation in women’s wrestling at the Games, winning 15 out of a possible 24 gold medals.
