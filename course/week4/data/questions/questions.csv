karate,"What are the different types of Karate? What are the rules of Karate?

Karate comprises two modalities: Kumite and Kata. In Kumite, or combat, the winner of the three-minute fights is the one who obtains a clear lead of eight points, or the competitor having the highest number of points at time-up. If the fight is a draw, then the winner is determined by the first unopposed point advantage (Senshu) or in the case of a scoreless result, by a majority decision of the judges (Hantei).

Points are scored according to correctly-executed techniques of controlled punches, strikes and kicks.

One point – “Yuko” – is awarded for delivering a punch with a closed hand (tsuki) to the head, neck, belly, side, back or torso of the opponent.

Two points – “Waza-ari” – are awarded for a kick to the body.

Three points – “Ippon” – are scored for a high kick delivered to the head, or for a punch delivered on an opponent who has been taken to the ground after a sweep or takedown.

In Kata (meaning ""form""), competitors execute a set of pre-approved choreographed movements, with the winner being declared by a pool of judges using an electronic voting system.

Karateka are evaluated according to technical and athletic performances.",What are the different ways in which points can be scored in Karate Kumite?,2,"Points can be scored in Karate Kumite by executing strikes such as punches, kicks, and elbow strikes to specific target areas on the opponent's body. Points can also be scored by demonstrating control, timing, and technique in blocking or countering the opponent's attacks. Additionally, points can be scored by executing takedowns or throws that display skill and control over the opponent."

trampolinegymnastics,"Trampolining was invented in 1934 by American gymnast George Nissen who, after watching trapeze acrobats perform tricks while bouncing off safety nets, built the first prototype trampoline to recreate their acrobatics. Initially used as a piece of equipment to train astronauts and athletes training for other acrobatic sports, the trampoline quickly became immensely popular as a sport in its own right. The first trampoline world championships were organised in London in 1964, and the sport joined the International Gymnastics Federation 34 years later in 1998.",Who invented the trampoline and when?,5,The trampoline was invented by George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936.

sportclimbing,"Sport climbing is a modern sport that has become immensely popular over the past 20 years. It is a young, mixed-gender sport – with 39 per cent of climbers under 18 years old – practised both outdoors and in a more urban format indoors. There are over 25 million climbers in 150 countries all over the world.

In 1985, a group of climbers gathered in Bardonecchia, near Turin, Italy, for an event called “SportRoccia”, which became the first organised lead competition in which competitors climb within a certain time limit. One year later, the first competition event on an artificial climbing wall was organised in Vaulx-en-Velin near Lyon, France.",What was the location of the first organised lead competition for sport climbing in 1985?,5,"The first organised lead competition for sport climbing in 1985 was likely held in Europe, possibly in France or Germany."
sportclimbing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

At the Olympics, sport climbing involves three formats : bouldering, speed and lead. In bouldering, athletes climb 4.5 m high walls without ropes, in a limited period of time and in the fewest attempts possible. Speed is a spectacular race against the clock in one-on-one elimination rounds that combine precision and explosivity. The best athletes scale a 15m high and five degrees inclinated wall in under six seconds for men and under seven seconds for women.

In the lead event, athletes climb as high as they can on a wall over 15m high in six minutes without having seen the route ahead of time. The routes for this event are more and more complex and challenging during the event, requiring all of the athletes’ physical and mental ability.

In Tokyo, each athlete competed in all three disciplines and the final scores reflected the combined results of the three competitions. The climber with the lowest score took home the first Olympic gold medal in the history of sport climbing.

In Paris 2024, two competitions will crown their own olympic champion in sport climbing. One will be a combined competition of bouldering and lead events, and the second one will only feature a speed event.",What is the scoring system for sport climbing at the Olympics and how is the overall winner determined?,5,"Sport climbing at the Olympics uses a scoring system called ""combined,"" where athletes compete in three disciplines: speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing. In speed climbing, athletes are timed as they race to the top of a standardized 15-meter wall. In bouldering, athletes attempt to complete a series of short, difficult routes within a set amount of time. In lead climbing, athletes have a set amount of time to climb as high as possible on a tall wall, with points awarded based on height reached. 

The overall winner is determined by combining the scores from each discipline. The athlete with the highest combined score is declared the winner."

Between 1984 and 2012, male boxers were required to wear protective headgear, but the rule was abandoned for the 2016 Rio Games (female boxers are still required to wear head guards). Each bout is disputed over three rounds of three minutes each for men, and four rounds of two minutes each for women. At the end of every round, each of the judges determine a winner based on the judging criteria and award the victor 10 points for the round. The loser of the round can be awarded anywhere between seven to nine points based on the level of performance in that round. After the bout ends, each judge adds up the round scores to determine a final winner.",What was the rule change regarding the wearing of protective headgear for male boxers in Olympic boxing between 1984 and 2016?,5,"The rule change regarding the wearing of protective headgear for male boxers in Olympic boxing between 1984 and 2016 was that in 2013, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) decided to remove the mandatory rule of wearing headgear for male boxers during competition, with the intention of reducing the risk of concussion and other injuries.

skateboarding,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The world’s greatest skateboarders will face each other at the Olympic Games, competing in the two most popular and spectacular disciplines: park and street. Athletes must carry out their most impressive tricks, meeting criteria for the degree of difficulty, speed and range of moves.

The events consist of two rounds: prelims and finals.

The park competition takes place on a varied course combining bowls and numerous bends, which the athletes use to gather speed and perform tricks mid-air.

The skateboarders are judged by the height and speed of the tricks they carry out during jumps, as well as their capacity to use the entire surface and all obstacles. They perform three 45‑second runs, with the best of three counting as their final round score.

Street events take place on a straight ‘street-like’ course with stairs, handrails, etc. set up to resemble the urban environments where skateboarding started out. Athletes perform a range of tricks and are also judged on how they control their board during the two 45‑second runs and five tricks they carry out.","How are the skateboarders judged in the Olympic Games competition, and what criteria do they need to meet in order to score well?",5,"Skateboarders in the Olympic Games competition are judged based on several criteria, including difficulty, execution, height, speed, originality, variety, and consistency of their tricks.

Archery requires great concentration and dexterity; archers must overcome their nerves as a single mistake can prove costly in competition. Individual competitions at the Games begin with the ranking round, where each of the 64 archers shoot 72 arrows to determine their ranking for the single-elimination bracket. The athletes compete in this knockout system until the final according to their ranking, with the top‑ranked archer facing off against the 64th‑ranked archer, the second‑ranked against the 63rd‑ranked, and so on.

The team event uses the same ranking results from the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams; the top four teams receive a bye into the quarterfinals, while the rest of the field competes in a single-elimination bracket. The mixed team event also uses the results of the ranking round to qualify and seed teams.",How are archers ranked for the individual competition at the Olympic Games?,5,"Archers are ranked based on their performance in the ranking round, which takes place before the individual competition at the Olympic Games.

The growing popularity of this sport resulted in the foundation of an international federation, the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM), in 1848. It currently has over 120 member nations.",What is the name of the international federation that governs the modern pentathlon?,5,The name of the international federation that governs the modern pentathlon is the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM).
modernpentathlon,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Modern pentathlon is made up of four events combining five sports:

- Riding, with a show jumping course on an unfamiliar horse that the athlete is allocated in a draw just 20 minutes before they compete.
- Fencing, which is split into two rounds: a ranking round where each athlete competes against each other athlete in a bout lasting one minute or until the first hit, and a second round based on the results of the first round. The format of the second round is single elimination, with each bout lasting 45 seconds. Points are scored for winning each bout.
- Swimming, with a 200m freestyle event.
- Running and shooting, with a laser-run where athletes alternate between running and shooting at five targets from a distance of 10m.
The modern pentathlon is divided into two sections. Firstly, athletes score points according to how they rank in the fencing, riding and swimming events, which decide their starting position for the laser run event. Secondly, during the laser-run, athletes start with a delay corresponding to the number of points between them and the leader. The first athlete to cross the finish line in the laser-run wins the gold medal.

Due to the diverse nature of the events involved, modern pentathlon is an extremely demanding sport that pushes athletes to their mental and physical limits and requires an exceptional variety of skills.",How is the winner of the modern pentathlon determined at the end of the competition?,5,"The winner of the modern pentathlon is determined by calculating points based on the performances of each athlete in the five events (fencing, swimming, show jumping, running, and shooting). The athlete with the highest total points at the end of all five events is declared the winner."
modernpentathlon,"Olympic History

Modern pentathlon was introduced to the Olympic programme in 1912 by Baron Pierre de Coubertin. Originally only one event was held per day before the events were brought together to be contested on the same day for a more exciting spectacle. The women’s event was introduced at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. The discipline has long been dominated by European National Olympic Committees, particularly Hungary and Sweden, with the latter taking 13 out of 15 medals available between the Stockholm 1912 and Los Angeles 1932 Games.",Which two European National Olympic Committees have historically dominated the modern pentathlon discipline at the Olympics?,5,Hungary and Sweden
marathonswimming,"At the first three editions of the modern Olympic Games, all swimming events took place in a natural body of water prior to the inclusion of pools at the Games in 1908. Marathon swimming reappeared in 1991 when the discipline was officially introduced at the FINA World Swimming Championships (now known as the World Aquatics Championships); at the time, events were held over 25km and took over five hours to complete. The first time the 10km race was contested was at the World Swimming Championships in Fukuoka, Japan in 2001.",When was the 10km marathon swimming race first contested at the World Swimming Championships?,5,2001
marathonswimming,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Marathon swimming takes places in open water environments such as the sea, rivers and lakes. Athletes must complete a 10km course, which takes nearly two hours to complete; their endurance, physical strength and brain power are all put to the test.

An ability to adapt is also crucial; tides and currents change quickly at sea, and the athletes must consider this in their strategy. Using the right tactics for the course and conditions is therefore key. In the last 3km, swimmers begin to make their move for the finish line—how they manage their efforts becomes essential and is what ultimately influences the end result.",How does the changing tides and currents impact the strategies of marathon swimmers in open water environments?,4,"Marathon swimmers in open water environments must consider the changing tides and currents when planning their route and pacing during a swim. Strong currents can either work in their favor, aiding their speed and momentum, or work against them, making it more difficult to stay on course. Swimmers may need to adjust their stroke technique or breathing patterns to navigate through changing currents, and may also need to plan their rest stops and feeding schedules accordingly. Overall, understanding and adapting to the tides and currents is crucial in order for marathon swimmers to be successful in open water environments."
marathonswimming,"Olympic History

Marathon swimming became the latest swimming discipline to be added to the Olympic programme when the 10km race was introduced at the Beijing Games in 2008. The short history of this discipline means that few National Olympic Committees and athletes have had a chance to stand out in marathon swimming.

Although certain athletes focus solely on marathon swimming, others were previously specialists in other freestyle pool events, making these swimmers highly competitive. A prime example is Tunisian swimmer Oussama Mellouli, who won the gold medal in the men’s 1,500m freestyle event in Beijing in 2008 and then won the men’s marathon swimming event in London four years later.","What was the latest swimming discipline added to the Olympic programme in 2008, and who won the gold medal in the men's marathon swimming event in London four years later after previously winning the men's 1,500m freestyle event in Beijing?",5,"The latest swimming discipline added to the Olympic programme in 2008 was the men's and women's 10km marathon swimming event.

3X3 basketball is played on one half of a basketball court where two teams of three players compete. Both teams attack and defend the same hoop, depending on who has possession of the ball. The winner is the team with the highest score at the end of 10 minutes or the first team to reach 21 points. The three‑point line in conventional basketball serves as the two-point line in 3X3 basketball, with shots made outside the line earning two points and those inside it one.

Men compete across the floor exercise, pommel horse, rings, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, while women’s events include the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise. Each element of gymnastic competition requires strength, agility, coordination, and precision.

Up until 2004, gymnastic routines at the Games were evaluated with a maximum of 10 points, but from 2005 the mode of scoring changed to a combination of a D score (difficulty/content of the exercise) and an E score (execution) to allow for a greater variation between athletes’ performances.

shorttrackspeedskating,"North American Origin

Short track (or indoor) speed skating began in Canada and the United States of America, where they held mass-start competitions on an oval track as early as 1905-1906. The lack of 400m long tracks led many North American skaters to practice on ice rinks. However, practicing on a smaller track brought new challenges, like tighter turns and shorter straightaways, which lead to different techniques in order to win on a shorter track. These countries began competing against each other on an annual basis. The sport’s rise in popularity was partly thanks to the North American racing rules, which introduced a “pack” style of racing. Capitalising on this, the organisers of the 1932 Lake Placid Games, with the consent of the International Skating Union (ISU), agreed to follow these rules for the programme’s speed skating events.",What led to the rise in popularity of short track speed skating in North America?,4,"The rise in popularity of short track speed skating in North America can be attributed to increased media coverage, the success of American and Canadian athletes in international competitions, and the excitement of the sport itself with its fast-paced action and close finishes.

Rowing involves propelling a boat using oars fixed to the vessel. It differs from other disciplines in that rowers sit with their backs to the direction of movement, therefore crossing the finish line backwards.

Rowers compete across a distance of 2,000 metres, alone or in teams of 2, 4 or 8. There are two different disciplines: double scull and sweep rowing. In sweep events, rowers hold a single oar with both hands, while in sculling they hold one oar in each hand. The eight-person crews have a coxswain, who steers the boat and directs the crew. The boat is steered using a small rudder that is attached to the foot of one of the rowers by a cable. There are two lightweight rowing events.",What is the difference between sweep rowing and sculling in rowing competitions?,5,"In sweep rowing, each rower uses a single oar with both hands, while in sculling, each rower uses two oars, one in each hand.

Dressage is the most advanced form of horse training, where horse and rider perform a series of artistic movements to music. Judges evaluate the ease and fluidity with which they move around the course.

The third discipline of eventing resembles an equestrian triathlon. It combines the two other events—jumping and dressage—with a third: cross-country, which consists of a long course combining solid and natural obstacles, drawing on the athletes’ endurance and experience. The horse and rider with the most versatile skills win the three events.",What are the three disciplines of equestrian at the Games and how are they scored?,5,"The three disciplines of equestrian at the Games are dressage, show jumping, and cross-country.

Biathlon-type events in Scandinavia are known to have been held as early as the 18th century. The first modern biathlon probably occurred in 1912, when the Norwegian military organised the Forvarsrennet in Oslo. An annual event, it consisted initially of a 17km cross-country ski race with two-minute penalties incurred by misses in the shooting part of the competition.",When and where did the first modern biathlon event occur?,5,"The first modern biathlon event is believed to have occurred in Norway in the early 20th century, possibly around the early 1900s."
biathlon,"Olympic History

In 1924 in Chamonix, an ancient form of biathlon made its Olympic debut: the military patrol. This event was then in demonstration in 1928, 1936 and 1948. After some attempts to incorporate it into a winter pentathlon, biathlon appeared at the Games in its current form in 1960 in Squaw Valley. Women’s biathlon made its first appearance on the Olympic programme in Albertville in 1992.

Until the 1976 Games in Innsbruck, the events comprised an individual race and a relay. In Lake Placid in 1980, a second individual event was introduced.

In Salt Lake City in 2002, a 12.5km pursuit event was added for men and 10km for women. From Turin in 2006, a new mass-start event was introduced for both men and women. This brings together the 30 best athletes from the World Cup.",When did women’s biathlon make its first appearance on the Olympic programme?,5,"Women's biathlon made its first appearance on the Olympic programme in the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France."
fencing,"Fencing’s origins can be found in swordplay, which has been practised for thousands of years—as evidenced by the discovery of carvings depicting fencers that date to around 1190 BCE which were discovered in a temple near Luxor, Egypt.

Spurred on by Italian, German and French fencing masters, fencing made the transition from a form of military training to a sport in either the 14th or 15th century. Fencing is now practised all over the world, generating fierce competition not only in Europe but also in Asia, Oceania, the Americas and Africa; the International Fencing Federation is now made up of 157 national federation members.",When and where were carvings depicting fencers discovered?,5,Carvings depicting fencers were discovered in 1926 in the ancient city of Knossos on the Greek island of Crete.
fencing,"Brief Overview of the Rules

In fencing, two competitors, each holding a weapon in one hand, face each other to strike their opponent on a valid target area of the body. The rules differ according to the type of weapon used. There are 12 events in Olympic fencing, with three types of weapon used: foil, épée and sabre.

Hits made with the point (tip), edge, or back of the blade are counted as valid in sabre, with the target area including the entire torso above the waist, as well as the head and arms. In épée and foil, fencers only score when they strike their opponent with the point of their weapon. In épée the target area covers the entire body from the mask down to the feet, while in foil the target area is the trunk only (torso, shoulders and neck). The first fencer to reach 15 points, or scores the most points at the completion of three three-minute rounds, wins the match. In team fencing, the first team to score 45 points, or the team leading when time runs out, wins.",What are the target areas for scoring in sabre fencing?,5,"The target areas for scoring in sabre fencing are the entire upper body, including the head, arms, torso, and waist."
fencing,"Olympic History

Fencing is a long-standing Olympic sport, as evidenced by its presence on the Olympic programme since the inaugural modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. Women’s fencing entered the Games in 1924 in Paris. Today, men and women compete in individual and team events. Previously, foil was the only women’s fencing event until the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games when women’s épée was added, while women’s sabre was added for the first time at the Athens 2004 Olympic Games.

Among the figures who have left their mark on the sport is Italy’s Nedo Nadi: the only fencer to have won a medal in every weapon in a single edition of the Games. In 1912, at 18 years old, he won gold in the foil. Then, after being decorated by his country for acts of bravery during World War I, he won five gold medals in Antwerp in 1920 - a historic and unequalled record - in the individual foil and sabre events, and in the team foil, épée and sabre events.",Which fencer is the only athlete to have won a medal in every weapon in a single edition of the Olympic Games?,5,Laura Flessel-Colovic
rhythmicgymnastics,"Gymnastics is one of the oldest sports that is still practiced today with origins that date back to ancient civilisation. In fact, the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), which was founded in 1881, is the oldest international sports federation in the world. Rhythmic gymnastics, however, is a far newer discipline of the sport, as it evolved from the mass gymnastics popular in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Rhythmic gymnastics can be simply explained as expression through movement. It combines elements of traditional dance and artistic gymnastics, making use of four apparatus: ribbon, hoop, ball and clubs. The music played during gymnasts’ performances also plays a significant role and music with vocals is allowed. Rhythmic gymnastics is a women‑only discipline.

In the individual events, gymnasts perform four times, using each piece of apparatus once. Each performance must be 75 to 90 seconds long. The group event sees a team of five gymnasts from the same National Olympic Committee performing twice. In the first routine, the gymnasts must all use the same apparatus, and in the second they use a mixed selection. The routine is evaluated using a combination of the D-score (difficulty / content of the exercise) the A score (Artistry) and the E score (execution).",What are the four apparatus used in rhythmic gymnastics and how many times do individual gymnasts perform in a routine?,5,"The four apparatus used in rhythmic gymnastics are ribbon, ball, hoop, and clubs.

cyclingroad,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Road cycling takes place outside and is divided into two kinds of events at the Olympic Games: the road race and the individual time trial.

The road race, in which all riders set off at the same time in a mass start, is a highly tactical feat of endurance. The race (over 120km and 200km for female and male athletes respectively) is often won in a sprint finish over a few hundred metres, which means riders need to position themselves perfectly and conserve their energy in the first part of the race.

The time trial is a solo effort in which competitors set off at staggered times rather than in a grouped peloton. They cover a much shorter distance than that of the road race, as the time trial rarely exceeds 50km. Both events require consistency, concentration, and preservation through effective aerodynamic positioning and power.",What are the two types of events in road cycling at the Olympic Games and how do they differ in terms of race format and distance covered?,5,"The two types of events in road cycling at the Olympic Games are the road race and the individual time trial. In the road race, multiple cyclists compete against each other in one mass-start race over a longer distance course, usually around 240 km for men and 140 km for women. In the individual time trial, cyclists race individually against the clock over a shorter distance course, usually around 44 km for men and 22 km for women."

Road cycling is one of the original Olympic events, as it featured on the competitive programme at the first modern Olympiad in 1896 in Athens. However, the discipline would be left out of the next three Olympiads before making a return at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm with the time trial. Women’s cycling was added to the Olympic programme in Los Angeles in 1984 with a road race, with the time trial added four years later. Prior to Atlanta '96, professional cyclists had been prohibited from competing at the Games; today, members of the professional cycling world have been welcomed at the competition, bringing additional prestige to Olympic races which are now contested by the world’s greatest cyclists.",When were women's cycling events first added to the Olympic programme?,5,Women's cycling events were first added to the Olympic programme in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.

athletics,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Modern athletics is composed of various running, jumping, throwing, walking, and combined events. Due to its many categories and disciplines, athletics involves the most participants in a single sport at the Olympic Games.

The track programme includes sprints, middle-distance and long-distance events as well as hurdles, steeplechase races, and relays for men and women. These events take place on the 400m oval track in the Olympic stadium (made up of two straights and two curved bends).

Two kinds of events are held on public roads —the marathon and race walking—which are both incredibly demanding and highly tactical, often leading to a variety of strategies with athletes sometimes even working together to defeat a rival. Spectators line the route to watch and cheer the athletes on.

The Olympic programme also includes two combined events—the seven-event women’s heptathlon and the ten-event men’s decathlon—both of which are contested over two days. Both competitions test athletes’ abilities across a range of athletic disciplines, with the most well-rounded competitor earning the gold medal. The disciplines are contested on, within, and around the track in the Olympic stadium, in the jumping area (high jump and pole vault), the jumping pit (long jump and triple jump), the throwing circle (shot put, discus and hammer throw), and the javelin runway. Athletes compete one after another, and the event includes a qualifying stage during which the best athletes secure their place in the final.",What are the two combined events in athletics that are contested over two days at the Olympic Games?,5,The two combined events in athletics that are contested over two days at the Olympic Games are the men's decathlon and the women's heptathlon.

The Olympic weightlifting programme has greatly evolved over time. Since the Montreal 1976 Games, there have been two lifts used in competition: the snatch and the clean and jerk. In the snatch, the bar is lifted from the floor to above the head in one movement. By contrast, the clean and jerk is a two-stage action: the bar is first brought up to the shoulders before being jerked over the head. These extremely demanding exercises require exceptional physical strength and ironclad mental resolve.

Today, competitors perform both lifts three times, and their best result in each lift are combined to determine their overall score.

Softball pitchers are also required to throw underhand, and most pitchers throw using the windmill pitch style, where the ball is thrown after rotating in a large circle. In softball, top female pitchers can reach speeds of over 100km/h. That speed fits with the fast-paced nature of the game. Since the bases aren’t as far apart, there is a shorter pitching distance. The game is also shorter in duration to baseball, with only seven innings compared to baseball’s nine.",What is the typical pitching style and speed of softball pitchers compared to baseball pitchers?,5,"Softball pitchers typically throw underhand at speeds ranging from 55-70 mph, while baseball pitchers typically throw overhand at speeds ranging from 75-100+ mph."

The sport made it to the United States by the 1770s, and the first organised professional league—the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players—was founded in 1875. Baseball is considered ""America's past-time"".

Softball was first imagined as “indoor baseball” in 1887 in Chicago, Illinois, by reporter George Hancock after watching someone hit a boxing glove with a broom handle. He went on to publish rules for the game and later took it outside, playing on fields too small for baseball. While the rules remained vague, interest in the game grew, and more than 100 area high school teams were formed by 1892.

In 1895, firefighters in Minneapolis, Minnesota, played a similar game named “kitten ball” using a ball of yarn wrapped in leather. In 1907, a guide for indoor baseball published by Albert Spalding allowed for game flexibility with two constants: a larger ball than baseball as well as underhand pitching. In 1926, Walter Hakanson proposed unifying the disparate versions of the game into one, under a single name: Softball.","By whom, where and when was the game of baseball first played?",2,"The game of baseball was first played by Americans in the mid-19th century, most likely in New York City around the 1840s.

flagfootball,"What are the rules of Flag Football?

There are five players on each team on the field drawn from 12-person squads. Players tend to specialise in either offence or defence and matches consist of two 20-minute halves.

A flag football pitch measures 70 x 30 yards (64m x 27.4m) with 10 yards (9.1m) allotted to each of the two endzones.

Play starts at the team's own five-yard line with the centre snapping the ball back to the quarterback who either passes the ball forward to try and find a receiver, or hands off to a running back.

The play is over when either a flag is removed, the ball-carrier goes out of bounds, or a forward pass hits the ground.

The team on offence has four attempts - known as downs - to go from their own five-yard line to halfway. If successful, they have another four downs to reach the endzone and score a touchdown. If unsuccessful on either count, the ball is turned over to the opposition who start on their own five-yard line.

After a touchdown, worth six points, teams go for an extra point - by running or passing - from the five-yard line, or two extra points from the 10-yard line.

If the scores are tied after 40 minutes, sudden-death overtime begins with the first team to score taking victory.",What is the size of a flag football pitch and how many players are on each team?,4,"A standard flag football pitch is typically around 60 yards long and 30 yards wide.

squash,"By whom, where and when was Squash invented?

Squash was derived from the game of racquets - itself a descendant of tennis - played in the 18th century in London prisons where players hit balls with rackets against a wall or in a corner to bring a sidewall into operation.

In the mid-19th century, following the advent of the vulcanisation of rubber, students at English boys’ boarding school Harrow replaced the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball which travelled slower.

Originally called 'baby racquets', a Harrow School election resulted in the name change to squash with graduates starting the spread of the sport beyond its public school origins.","When did students at English boys' boarding school Harrow replace the hard racquets ball with a larger, hollow rubber ball?",5,"It is believed that students at Harrow began using a larger, hollow rubber ball around the mid-19th century (around the 1850s or 1860s)."

At the start of a point, the server must serve from one of the two service boxes on the floor and strike the ball between the service line and the out line.

After that, all subsequent shots can be struck off any wall provided it hits the front wall between the tin and the out line before hitting the ground. The ball is only permitted to bounce once on the floor.

Freestyle wrestling is a much more open form of the sport in which competitors also use their legs and can hold opponents above or below the waist.

However, the objective is the same in both styles. Contested on a circular combat area, a bout consists of two three-minute periods. Wrestlers must either use their bare hands to pin their opponent’s two shoulders down to the mat without holding them by their singlet (this is called a ‘fall’) or, if no fall is secured during the bout, have the most points at the end of regulation time by performing takedown and reversal moves.",What are the two Olympic wrestling disciplines and how do the rules differ between them?,5,"The two Olympic wrestling disciplines are freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling. 

In freestyle wrestling, wrestlers are allowed to use their arms and legs to attack and defend, allowing for more varied techniques such as takedowns and leg attacks. In Greco-Roman wrestling, wrestlers are only allowed to use their upper body to attack and defend, meaning they cannot attack or grab their opponent's legs.

cricket,"What are the rules of Cricket?

Each team has 11 players with one side batting and the other fielding. The fielding side has at least five bowlers who bowl (throwing with a straight arm unlike a baseball pitcher's bent arm) at one of a pair of batters on a pitch 22 yards (20 metres) away. The batter guards a set of three wooden stumps in the ground - with two bails on top - and the wicketkeeper from the fielding side stands behind them.

A batter scores runs by hitting the ball and running to the other end of the pitch with their partner going in the opposite direction. If they score an odd number of runs, their partner faces the next ball. A batter scores four runs for hitting the ball to the boundary, and six runs should the ball clear the boundary rope without touching the ground. A bowler bowls an over - six balls in succession - before another bowler begins the next over from the other end of the pitch.

The main ways in which a batter can be out (dismissed) are bowled (if the bails are dislodged by the ball), caught, leg before wicket (if the ball hits the batter's pads in front of the stumps) and run out (bails removed by a member of the fielding side with the ball before the batter completes a run).

If a team loses 10 wickets, leaving one batter on their own, they are 'all out' and the innings is over. In T20, the innings is usually complete at the end of 20 overs. The team batting second must then try to exceed that score inside 20 overs and without losing all 10 wickets.

volleyball,"William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director and a student at Springfield College, is credited with creating the game of volleyball in 1895 in Holyoke, Massachusetts. 

Mintonette (as volleyball was called at the time) was designed to be an indoor pastime that could be enjoyed by older members of the YMCA, and took some of its characteristics from other sports including tennis and handball. 

Volleyball became popular very quickly, and rapidly developed in other countries in the early 20th century, first in Canada, then in Cuba and Japan. The first rulebooks for the sport were produced in the early 1900s, with the first international federation (Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB)) following in 1947. The first men’s world championships took place the following year, with the women’s competition debuting in 1952.",Who is credited with creating the game of volleyball in 1895?,5,William G. Morgan
volleyball,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on an indoor court 18m long and 9m wide. Matches are played to the best of five sets. A point is scored when the ball lands within the court boundaries or when a playing error is made. The first team to score 25 points by a two-point margin wins the set, with each match following a best-of-five sets format. If required, a fifth set is played to 15 points (a winning margin of two points is still required). 

In a game of volleyball, the ball can reach speeds of up to 130km/h, particularly following a spectacular jump serve or smash. Athletes therefore require great strength and lightning-fast reflexes to block them.",What is the required winning margin for a team to win a set in volleyball?,5,The required winning margin for a team to win a set in volleyball is two points.
volleyball,"Olympic History

Volleyball made its Olympic debut at the Tokyo 1964 Games. The women’s and men’s competitions used a single round-robin format, where every team was placed into a single pool and played each other once. This system remained in place until the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich; the format was switched to a pool round and final round of quarter‑finals, semi-finals and a final to determine the medal winners.

Teams from the Soviet Union and Cuba regularly found the Olympic podium in the 1980s, as did Italy and the People’s Republic of China in the 1990s, followed by Brazil in the 2000s.

beachvolleyball,"Brief Overview of the Rules

Beach volleyball is played by two teams of two players on a sand court 16m long and 8m wide—slightly smaller than an indoor court—that is divided by a net. Beach volleyball uses the same net height as indoor volleyball: 2.24m for women and 2.43m for men.

The first team to win two sets wins the match. The first two sets are played to 21 points each and the third set, if necessary, is played to 15 points. As there are only two players per team, players have a lot more ground to cover, which means they need lightning-fast reflexes. Beach volleyball matches are played outdoors, where wind, sun, and rain can affect playing conditions; players therefore need to be very versatile and adapt to the elements in order to succeed.",What are the dimensions of a beach volleyball court and how many sets are played in a match?,5,"The dimensions of a beach volleyball court are 16m by 8m.

beachhandball,"Beach and Indoor Differences

While beach handball stems from indoor handball, the sand underfoot shapes how the game is played. The softer landing often results in spectacular, twisting mid-air shots from players hoping to outwit the goalkeeper. Unlike indoor handball, beach handball is not only a non-contact sport, but each period is also scored separately. The winner of a period is awarded one point. Tied matches are decided by a shootout, where a player will try to beat the opposing team’s goalkeeper in a one-on-one. In the shootouts, each team gets five initial attempts. If the scores remained tied, sudden death decides the winner.","What scoring system is used in beach handball, and how are tied matches typically decided?",5,"In beach handball, the most common scoring system used is the best of three sets, with each set played to a certain number of points (usually 12 or 16).

judo,"Brief Overview of the Rules

The objective of judo is to throw your opponent to the ground, immobilise them with a pinning hold or force them into submission with a joint lock or choke. There are two types of scores in judo:

An ippon is awarded when an athlete throws his opponent to the mat on his or her back with strength, speed and control. An ippon can also be awarded through submission or by pinning an opponent to the ground for 20 seconds. If a judoka achieves ippon, they immediately win the match.

A waza-ari is awarded for a throw that isn’t clear enough to be an ippon (either because it lacked speed or force, or the opponent did not land primarily on their back) or when an   opponent is pinned down for less than 20 seconds (but longer than 10 seconds). Two waza‑ari in one match is the equivalent of an ippon and immediately ends the match.

Judo competitions are divided into weight classes for both genders, with a match lasting four minutes (the match enters overtime in the event of a tied score after four minutes). Penalties are awarded for passiveness during matches or behaviour deemed contrary to the spirit of judo.",What is the difference between an ippon and a waza-ari in judo scoring?,5,"An ippon in judo scoring is the highest score a competitor can achieve, awarded for a perfect throw, pin, or submission technique. A waza-ari is a lower score awarded for a throw that is almost perfect but not quite as technically precise as an ippon."
