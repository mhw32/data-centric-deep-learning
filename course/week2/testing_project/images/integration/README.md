# Instructions

Add files here to run the integration test. You can find an example in the `example/` folder.

1. Put 10 images in `digits-raw`, one for each of the digits between zero and nine. These images you might have taken with a camera or phone. Crop them as best you can to a square. 
2. Process these 10 images using the `testing/clean.py` script. Put them in the `digits-processed` folder.
3. Finally, we expect a file `labels.csv` that maps each image file to its annotation.
