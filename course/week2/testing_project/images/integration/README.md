# Data for Integration Test

Add files here to run the integration test. Put 10 images in `digits-raw`, one for each of the digits between zero and nine. These images you might have taken with a camera or phone. Crop them as best you can to a square. Put 10 new iamges in `digits-processed` that have been processed with the `clean.py` script. Finally, we expect a file `labels.csv` that maps each image file to its annotation. See the project pages for more details.
