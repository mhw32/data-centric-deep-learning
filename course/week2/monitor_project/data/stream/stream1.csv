Should have listened to the reviews. The bill is half the size in length of a regular baseball cap.,0
"Worked for about 6 months then just stopped working power will not turn on, speakers started going about a month before it completely went out",0
Fan on light is loud but great quality light overall for the price I would recommend it,1
"just not enough raisin temp to be useful, maybe my pool was too large",0
i had them for less than a month and one by one they all just stopped working and my phone would say “accessory is not supported”,0
My gf loved them while I gifted yes her first set of dice. Affordable and a great look.,1
"the antena booster work as intended, landing gear is good, but the visor cause problem for gimbal if u using push on lense",1
"I purchased this exhaust to replace an old Broan that sounded like an airplane. While this unit is not completely silent, it Is a very low sounding extractor. Verify your measurements before you purchase. My electrician had to work pretty hard to install this unit. Overall, I am very pleased.",1
The suction cups suck. They don’t work. Net part is fine with suction cups I bought separate,0
"The product did not ship with a cool pack, but arrived in good shape anyway. I counted the candy and was disappointed to find that one bag of peanut M&M's was missing and substituted with an extra bag of Skittles. I never intended to eat the Skittles, so it looks like my coworkers will be getting an extra bag of candy. All in all, I thought it would be cheaper than buying the candy bars individually, but after giving away the Skittles, it actually isn't much of a savings, so I won't be buying this package again.",1
The enter key is alittle small but you adjust to it eventually. for the price it's a good deal. the enter key needs to be bigger and hopefully in the future not as loud.,1
"Pros: Easy assembly, about 20mins with 2 people. Directions good. Looks nice and very sturdy when all assembled. Cons: Some small scratches on metal frame. Some discoloration on wooden slates but easily hidden with a furniture marker. A couple of minor warped slates.",1
Does not cook the stuff uniformly and tends to burn the bread.,0
"Now it just sprays non-stop. It is easy to clean and was easy to assemble, but I didnt expect it to be disposable. Disappointed. Its suppose to have a warranty, but not sure I would even want another one. Luckily and unfortunately, it was cheap.",0
Material was not what expected,0
"I don’t like this screen protector. Although it does add grip to the screen, it also makes the screen loom fuzzier/pixelated when you look up close. I purchased this for the purpose of making more drawings and art but it seems to make the screen look lower quality and I don’t like how it looks",0
"First, the button for the crown only works to scroll. The watch didn't charge while it was the case. It actually lost power. The Philips head screwdriver could barely turn the the screw that holds the case tightly together because one of the legs of the ""+"" is missing. I have my own set of small screwdrivers so I was able to loosen and tighten the screw. To me the case took too much away from the watch functions for me.",0
Runs small (I wear a size 8 and the large that I ordered is tight) and is incredibly scratchy/itchy.,0
Good quality. Can cover more than two cards. Meet expectation.,1
"This is a well made device, much higher quality than the three previous cat feeders we've tried. The iOS app works well although the design is a little confusing at first. The portion control is good and the feeder mechanism has worked reliably. The camera provides a clear picture and it's great to be able to check remotely that the cat really is getting fed. Setup was relatively easy.",1
"Broke after 2 uses, not worth the money.",0
It takes to long to recharge it by power,1
I was worried that they wouldn't fit since most frames are too large for my face. These fit perfectly!,1
"They are not that bright, easy to install.",0
One of the screens arrived shattered already. Doesn’t exactly aspire to me trusting the product.,0
It doesn't even connect to my smartphone! But without smartphone it is absolutely useless.,0
Too complicated to set up and use! Request return instructions. Thanks.,0
"I love these shelves but I was pissed when I went to put them up. The metal washer covers don't fit over all the plastic washer. So, I was stuck leaving the ugly black plastic washers showing. Very upsetting. You can't tell this at first glance either unless you physically put the washers inside of a metal piece.",0
Has some small pebbles in it but it’s not made for consumption so I figured may have some in it.,1
"This product arrived quickly and packaged well, My family enjoys Smoothies as nutritious, fast meal replacements,I wanted to supply them with the tools needed to properly clean the straws that accompany their insulated Smoothie travel cups.This set is an affordable, quality product! Thank you!",1
"I have no idea of this thing works or not. After a hour of tried to just set it to go off, I finally gave up, put in in the box and sent it right back. I read the directions over and over. Sooo confusing.",0
Not tips. Full nails. Not good for what I wanted. But theres a lot of size choices.,0
"The steel rule I received is very inaccurate, I ordered it for accurate markings. I never write negative reviews , but this rule is really bad. I checked against calipers and a rule I know is correct. It does make a fair straight edge.",0
Just okay but fits decently,1
It just doesnt look like picture. The picture looks tightly gathered and beautifully ruffled. I've had it awhile now and I'm going to take it off bed and try to do some sewing to it and see if I can fix it. I probably should have returned it right away but it's too late now and I think with some adjustments I can make it work.,0
Very pretty and well made. It was just a little larger around than I wanted. I kept it anyway because it did serve the purpose.,1
I loooove the smell of this oil and its charms are potent as well. I wear this often as my regular scent. About to order my 3rd bottle. <3,1
I just had surgery on my shoulder AND my foot. This package could not be more perfect. I've been able to increase my range of motion and mobility in my arm because I can do the exercises at home and not just twice a week with the physical therapist. I plan on using these when I get back into the gym too.,1
Was snug for the size. I ordered larger size as well. Nicely made though.,1
I like the length it's not to long and also that it has 3 pockets.,1
"Fit a little more snug than I expected after reading other reviews, but still happy with my purchase. Update: Right after my original review two small holes on the shoulder seam appeared. I wouldn’t buy this again.",0
"It came triple wrapped in bubble wrap, outside and inside the box. There was one broken one, but a few drops of alcohol fixed that. Shipping was on time. I'll update once I've worn them.",1
The product suppose to come with the leash Leash is missing,0
"I enjoyed the twists in this well-written novel but some of it was pretty predictable. The characters were believable and interesting, and the plot suspenseful. I liked the time shifts from one chapter to the next.",1
"Great concept, but the wires are still a mess and this did not do much to help the problem",0
"Is not water resistant, color is more green instead of white.",0
Absolutely love the set! My 2.5 yr old daughter is very happy with her bedding and describes the owl to us.,1
"I like that I got a medium and I can make is smaller. I am 5’4 142 and if one wants it tight, you can...and if you want it with a little more breathing room, it can still be adjusted without the need to go up a size.",1
This product is absolutely bullshit. You can not even grab a cookie sheet out of the oven that has been baking at 350 degrees without getting burned. You could pretty much put on a pair of winter gloves and be better off. A complete and utter waste of money. Extremely disappointing! The description states 932 degrees F????!!!!,0
Works well even with my old scanner I just replaced,1
"Item mute the sound, but it also changed it (not good). Additionally, the seam between the 2 pieces was loose and rattled anytime I played it. -Down 3 stars- This will be a return item. I think it could be better and for the price I gave 2 stars.",0
The cleaning brush was not included. Straws are what I thought though.,0
It was very over priced.,1
I would give a proper review if I ever received my order but I paid for a decal and never received it. Give me my money back.,0
There was no edge or rim protection. I was looking for something similar to my old IPad cover,0
Good quality batteries at a fraction of retail prices. Came in small envelope packaging. Did not have any expiration dates shown.,1
It was a mistake. I meant to order Quicken for Dummies. My mistake.,0
"It's super sticky, and I end up taking it with my phone when I grab it. Also, the Google pixel is too heavy for the pad to hold it upright. It is also a little long for my dashboard",0
"Really cool, small and LOUD alarm. Humidity function works well. REALLY BRIGHT - only downfall if there is one is no F only C on the temp (thankfully I know both)",1
"The plastic film is very flimsy. The right side always rips no matter how carefully you peel it. For some weird reason, the left side doesn't have this issue. Definitely not the same quality as the photo albums from years ago. I'm returning this.",0
"It was a very pretty gift to give, and allot more sturdy then I believed, my mom loved it. I did expect it to be a bit bigger, the betty boop in the middle is small and easily over looked",1
"Perfect for Bose cord replacements, or for converting to Bluetooth using a small receiver with an Aux In input.",1
"when you run out of power, you need to re-adjust the time.",1
"Absolutely no protection on the phone, flimsy plastic material, terrible quality. This is the bulkiest case I have ever held and it only fits two cards at maximum - no squeezing a third at all. Very expensive and obviously cost very little to produce. Stay away~!",0
Too small and cheap.,0
"while the price was excellent and the tool for holding the bands was very good, the bands themselves flew apart about a min. after you started sanding with them. The first one I thought was a fluke but after 10 or so came apart I was concerned . Without eye protection someone could have a serious accident ,I was hit twice in the face as they flew apart. They are separating at the seam and the band of grit is coming loose from the belt. I don't know if somewhere along the line they got wet,or they are not rated for the speed of a simple dremel band rotary tool. The cheapest single speed tools on the market still go at the 25,000 rpm range ,( which was the speed I was using). If these bands are not rated for at least that speed they are no good for much of anything.",0
"We use these in our headlamps and other camping flashlights, and our experience is that they don't last as long as other batteries.",0
"Haven't used it yet, but can't wait to see the results",1
"This item is great, and it arrived sooner than it said it would. Just in time for my sons birthday party!",1
you can wireless charge through this case.,1
They are super nice but broke as we hung them. Not in one place but all the places,0
This is an awesome coffee bar! We put it to fairly easy. Just make sure you look at the piece and figure out which is the front and back. I had to take it back apart and turn some around.,1
"I am very unhappy with these socks. They are so small and tight -- and it was very, very difficult to put them on. They felt too tight once they were on -- and they did not stretch out. When I washed them in cold water, they shrank even more. I can't wear these and I would like a refund...please. David Peck",0
Got these for my mom and she loves them!,1
Durable and sleek looking. Easy to put on the phone and has protected my phone from getting a broken screen after dropping it often,1
"Titan series heroes are very good for your child's first Marvel or super hero figures. No small parts, minimal articulation. We have five or so different characters for my son and they are very durable. Very pleased with these items. Nice prices for these here.",1
"Really like it, keeps my food cold use it every day.",1
we live with a road on either side of us and it really didn't help our dust problem,0
Good quality but too small,0
Excellent quality and fast delivery,1
"Tried two of these straw cups in this design, and I sent both back. It must be the material used to make the part holding the straw in place that is defective because the green version of the product works fine. I usually enjoy Contigo products; this is the first time I've been disappointed.",0
"Documentation for the camera was poor, or non-existent. This camera has so many modes and features that a full scale manual should come with it. I got into modes/screens that I couldn't figure out and the ""Start Up Guide,"" was worthless. Trying to find the manual online was another headache; never did find one...",1
I've used tungsten puddy and metal weights before and this is much easier to work with. It is super easy to cut and trim. Got the weight just where we wanted it.,1
These lights are super bright and worked out perfect for both of my trucks,1
I'm not fond if the textured backdrops. Otherwise it works ok and for the price it's ok but a smooth surface would be better.,1
"As a cane, it's just OK. Joints are wabbly. The flash light is useless. I thought the batteries were dead so I bough new batteries and it's just as dim. You have about 3 inches of light visibility.",0
I was very excited about getting these pens and I love about half of them. There are some that don’t write at all and a lot that will run dry while you’re using them. It makes it very difficult to color/draw with these. I’m strongly considering returning them :(,0
"ok, but a littel small",1
I came in the middle of the series but still enjoyed the story and characters.,1
A different type of music from Keith but well done. Good featured artists.,1
I’ve purchased these for 2 years. Prices keep increasing but the quality gets worse. 12 inch pieces are now spliced together and come apart within minutes.,0
This cable is listed with a length of 1 foot. It is actually 10 inches which makes a difference if you want to use it to hook up a mini keyboard to a macBook Pro.,0
"I'm no Chef, but the nice large size it good for flipping over omelettes!",1
"These actually work pretty darn good. Yiu can build it up, higher, or keep it short. And the cross braces add rigid and sturdy. I wish they had different size (length) cross braces, as the ones come with make you build it a certain size,because they are fixed length. It makes a kind of triangle structure about 12 inches each side.",1
Very nice stand. It works perfectly for keeping cats away from my indoor plant. Easy to assemble and looks good as well.,1
Total rip off. Thought this was a multipack as i am used to but it was a single bar. Very disappointed. First purchase through Amazon in all these years i am not satisfied with.,0
Have saved these as presents for my Grandsons!,1
This game is fun and fun,1
"These did help with curls, but I needed a second package due to my extra long and think hair. I was surprised at how comfortable they were during sleep.",1
Love how it looks. I am usually a M and order a L fits loose enough to wear with jeans or skirts.,1
The glue works fine but the container is impossible to work with. The cap doesn't come off without plyers and then won't go back on without a violent abrupt force involving both hands and a solid object (desk drawer). This happened even though I was careful to not gum up the lid or tapering snout.,0
Works really good and goes super fast.,1
The reason why I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 is the color. The color says bronze but in actually it is almost black. I wanted a dark brown color.....,1
"These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head.",1
"I received this bag today, it looks very cute and unique. However, be aware that the dimensions described are not right. The bag is very small, and likely would just fit your phone and the keys. Going to return it.",0
Absolute WORST pads ever!!!!!!!! Terrible!!!! They fall apart when you open one up. Huge mess! It should be a crime that anything so crappy can be made and sold.,0
This kind of shredded after a little while. I also didn't like how the metal part kept becoming exposed (because covering kept slipping off) and actually snagging onto my clothing. I will not buy this again as it wasn't very durable.,0
The silk is beautiful! My baby loved it but my wooden ring broke after she had it for just a couple days.,0
"I received two of these and both have been defective, leaking butane liquid when attempting to refill butane lighters.",0
"Works great, and the quality is superb.",1
Not sure but I don't think the infrared light last as long as the regular ones do. Only lasted me a little over a year. I'm not sure how long the warranty is or how to get a replacement.,0
Was not as advertised. Is not 6” insertable.,0
Great seller. Will purchase from them again.,1
they broke the same night we got them don't bother,0
I love this holder. The brushes are not super durable so they need replacement,1
Came in a box with bottled water. Bag was crushed and opened.,0
I've had the chair for two days and love it but unfortunately I've had to add air to the ball at the end of each day. I'm only 120 pounds and I don't believe I should have to add air that frequently,0
SENT ONE ORDER THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. AMAZON GOT A SUPPOSED FREE REPLACEMENT. NOW THEY WANT TO CHARGE ME FOR THE OTHER ORDER. WASN'T MY FAULT THE VENDOR MESSED UP.,0
Sorry but these are a waist of money. Washed my handy one time and they come right off. I even glued them on because they were so cheep and didn’t stay when you put the ring on .,0
Okay if you like crass potty humor.,0
Had to return due to the awful smell on these pants,0
this book awesome an amazing read i loved it so much that i whant to read more i can't wait until de others come out,1
Most comfortable boots I’ve ever worn. Easy on and off. Very flexible,1
Packaging was not great and one of the knives are bent,0
Picture doesn’t come out very clear. Everyone asks what it is a picture of. Very abstract,0
Very well made and cute.,1
Grand daughter loved it!,1
I like the way it makes the phone looks now. Great privacy from the side view. Very easy to install get product overall.,1
These smart plugs work great some of the time. The rest of the time they flicker don’t connect or simply don’t work. Buy other more reputable plugs.,0
It didn’t rlly get my blackheads out it just made them stick out without it sucking the blackheads,0
Got to have the right kind of grease gun.,1
Must have to use in water softer systems,1
comfy at first but wears down fairly quickly. stretched out and slips off feet when walking,0
I did order fine point pens and I expected them to be fine but ink comes out way too light for purposes.,0
Never get tired of this genre. Top of the line story and writing.,1
"Ordered this item, received peppermint instead of bergamot. No returns allowed so I ordered bergamot again and kept the original peppermint. 2nd order arrives ALSO PEPPERMINT instead of bergamot and it’s broken, coating my hands and the rest of my mail with peppermint. The kicker? It turned my fingers orange! Never ordering from this company again.",0
They we're quick to install and felt like they were of quality the ones for the Elite controller are a more high grade but these work just fine for adapting a controller for a smaller trigger pull,1
"Bought the black one with flowers on the sleeves and hood. This is my second time wearing it, and a big hole is forming on my l the left arm from the thread loosening. Returning for poor quality.",0
A 1” hole unravelled on the back of the right glove on the second day I wore them.,0
Please be very careful.... This wax gets extremely hot. It blistered my face in 4 different spots..,0
Fit to size. Like them a lot,1
Too many dark things around what could have been a beautiful wedding. Dogs played a very small role. Others in the series have been better.,1
I bearly received the headphones 2 days ago and one earbud completely cuts on n off 😔,0
"Please read all the reviews regarding installation difficulty. To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned. I hope this review is helpful! Good luck!",0
Did not keep my neck cool,0
It doesn't straighten your big toe at all.,0
"These notebooks really keep me on track, love them!",1
"If you're wondering whether these are knock-offs, then remember you get what you pay for. These earbuds look and even feel like the real thing, but their sound quality is so bad it's clear that they're not. In a head-to-head with a pair of known, genuine Apple earbuds, the two pairs look identical, but sound remarkable different. It's clear the emphasis for these earbuds is looking the part but not carrying any respectable sound quality. Mind you, Apple earbuds aren't an audiophiles pick to begin with, but these sound so bad the difference between the genuine and fake buds is so obvious. Unless you're looking to use these exclusively for scratchy audio in phone calls, I'd keep looking.",0
I use this to keep my cream fresh. It works and keeps the cream fresh for about 4-5 hours.,1
"I was excited to get these, but surprised to find them so small. They were so lightweight I could not get them to throw very far. Quality-wise they seem to be just fine. I just wish there were a little bigger. Probably my fault for not reading the specs better.",0
"I didn't think I would need 2 but one was defective, very scratchy when it was moved. I replaced it with the othe cord and it works fine.",0
Better off using pieces of yarn - difficult to transfer from one needle to the other.,0
You ran out of black in my size,1
"My John Deere belt and blade cut more evenly than this set (was a mulching kind). It's not cutting as evenly. Where the tires run this blade doesn't pull up the grass well enough to cut it at same height as where the tire doesn't run, whether the grass is wet or dry. Maybe blade doesn't have enough vacuuming effect. And, the belt may have some slippage due to it not having enough contact area with the pulleys.",0
"I bought these for riding on my scooter in town. They are great! They kept the wind and dust, dirt out of my eyes unlike regular sunglasses. They are polarized and are great for summer. They are hard to see with at night, maybe it's just me.",1
Shipped quickly. Sooner then expected. Came with 16 AAA batteries The charger does charge both AA and AAA batteries. Charged existing batteries pretty quickly.,1
This broke after a couple uses. Really disappointing.,0
pretty but they didn’t last real long before they didn’t light up anymore,0
Ordered this item for my infant during this cold weather! Item stated it was delivered but I never received. Customer service was not great about replacing item as that’s what I wanted instead of refund! Not happy with service at all!!!!,0
both mugs arrived broken,0
Didn't like at all but I am not going to pay to return so will just sit around till I throw it out.,0
Works okay for the price and being manually..!,1
This cable is not of very good quality. It doesn’t fit right so you have to hold the connector to the port in order to work.,0
It was cute while it lasted!!! My issue was the cap size.,1
Cute! My 3 year old loves it! My 7 year old will even play with it too.,1
Once I installed dimmable bulbs this worked great! No flicker,1
Really cool looking shirt. Grandson loves it.,1
Great little book to help introduce yourself to some of nature’s little gems.,1
More like a sports bra,0
Was surprised by a few things I learned about Mr. Gable. Interesting,1
"Product is great, but I ordered 9 of these all came in 9 different bags",0
I have bought this for last year from bodybuilding.com. Love the stuff usually. Amazon had it and wanted quick shipping so ordered from here. It tastes nothing like what I have repeatedly ordered from other provider!!! Generally love it but not this order!! Looks legit packaging but not even close for flavor and quality.,0
This brand cracks a lot. Not great quality but I’ll let my kids paint with it and get some better stuff for myself.,0
"This reads like a first draft. 1. The characters are static, 2. The villains' motivations are not well thought out, 3. The setting is somehow both bland and overdone, 4. The pacing is rushed towards the end. It feels like the author got tired of writing and just slapped together an ending. This is the second book ever that I will take the time to completely remove from my Amazon account, not just delete from my device.",0
"Fast shipping, just what we needed.",1
"Beautiful bright and vivid color combo of red and yellow flowers for the Monarchs. Did awesome in the ground outside in warmer weather. Brought inside for winter however and did really good for most of the winter and spring, but died on me about a month ago. Will get another one.",1
Seems to thicken thinning hair.,1
A great sweater for a holiday party. Make sure it’s cool enough to wear though - it’s SUPER WARM!,1
My kid was able to unleash himself within minutes.,0
"these were VERY tiny, super cheap and the color was smeared, bought as a Christmas present - threw them away.",0
Warms up quickly. Our iguana loves it,1
I absolutely love it. It's TRUE to size. I wear a 12 and purchased a LG. Perfect fit,1
"Protect your phone from dust, scratches and any impact with this case. Made from soft rubber TPU bumper and hard material back makes this case capable of protecting the phone on a daily basis. The rubber itself is transparent yet it has full and colorful sparkle bling glitter style design that makes it look more attractive. It is easy to insert and remove the phone from this case, and with its precise cutout design, you’ll have no trouble accessing the port and buttons on the phone. The package also includes a full coverage tempered glass screen protector that you will appreciate. I highly recommend this case, as it is a high-quality product and hard to beat especially at this price point.",1
I love this product for cleaning my phone Notepad and computer screens,1
"bag. I was not dissapointed , big enough for my cloth for a week. I had it for carry on in the plane. The zippers were good, almost going to easy. I also think the bag looks nice.",1
Does not fit as flattering as I thought it would but its and okay product,1
"These markers looked perfect for what I wanted them for, AND they were a great price as an add-on (which was why I didn't give one star). But they really disappoint once the lid comes off. The colors are bright and vibrant, but they bleed together. While they may wash off of clothes (I haven't had a need to check) it does not wash off of the dry erase board. Even after a few minutes, the black stained my dry erase board. No matter how hard I scrubbed, it's still there. I will try what someone else suggested, and use a clorox wipe. But, I don't like to use those, and I definitely don't want my kids using them. If I wanted a permanent marker, that's what I would have bought. These totally negate the purpose of a temporary writing surface. I will NOT be purchasing these again OR recommending them to friends.",0
WARNING!!! Will make your fur babies sick! After 400 dollar vet bill the diagnosis is this.,0
This product does work however u have to bomb spray vacuum wash or nothing will work,1
Is good to protect your phone but It limits what your phone can do like the in display-fingerprint scanner does not work properly after installation and face Id takes longer to unlock your phone I even try to reset the fingerprints but did not work like it used to,0
My 6 month old loves these. Started with mesh feeder and way to hard to clean so purchased silicone feeder and love it some much better. I am glad that there are multiply sizes as baby grows my son uses the med. size one right now. Great product would definitely buy again.,1
Flag itself was on point. Suction cup to secure the flag sucked.,0
Fake product!!!!!! Smells terrible and dried out my hair. I've used the real thing and this is NOT it.,0
"Runs small, cute 2 piece.",1
I love this desk! It is sturdy and offers me plenty of space. Love the color. It is not a real wood top and the top comes in two pieces but it works for me. It is responsive to the up/down motion. Definitely worth the money so far for being in this price range. I will update this if anything changes.,1
"I like the case, it works well. I wish it came in purple. The only complaint I have is that it doesn’t charge well on the cordless charger.",1
Strong material which is great because I always seek to rio my knee highs. Look great and fit my size 11 feet well.,1
"This is a must read for Americans who want to survive when terrorists disrupt everything in our daily routines. This book is a survival guide written as a story and told by interested, but flawed characters, much like most of us.",1
Great lightweight suitcase. Comes with removable plastic covering to help eliminate scratches,1
Great hold and strength on the magnet. Can be easily maneuvered to fit your needs for holding curtains back.,1
"I bought this for my daughter and wish I could return it. I would not buy again nor recommend. Yes, it works but battery life is short and every time after charging it there is an issue, the time is wrong or it won't turn back on. Too frustrating for my daughter and for me. Sometimes it goes to military time and no idea why. By something better. Also its hard band to put on. My child cant do it on her own and she is 9. I would skip purchase.",0
"My two boys love it (ages 6 & 7). It has lights on the wheels, so you can see them in the dark. I take the Scooters with us everywhere we go. Perfect Gift. It will get use...",1
It may seem more convienent to mix all of the poweder at once but with apple cider vinegar and water it will mold quickly and it is wasted.,0
"Bought this to clean up cat hair . It does not do it. The spinning brush has stopped spinning if there is any tiny pressure put on it. I'm not talking about heavy pressure, the least amount of pressure, just putting it on the floor stops the brush. Its useless.",0
Looks cute! I think it will be popular with my granddaughter?! (Christmas stocking gift),1
"I bought because cheap, woops. It broke within 2 minutes. The rubber belt is stretchy like an inner tube so it is near impossible to get a grip, and when i did it just snapped.",0
"OK BUT NOTHING REALLY SPECIAL. NOT IMPRESSED WITH. SEEMS SMALL. AGOOD BANDAID WOULD DO SAME. CAN ONLY BE HONEST ,",0
unless i have something set wrong. this is the worst camera i have ever owned. not happy . way over priced,0
"I didn't like how these fit my daughter. She simply bend down to pet our dog, and split right in the crotch within an hour of opening them.",0
very cheap had to find brackets in local hardware store to attach to bike,0
Very happy with this.,1
"this is a great book for parents who want to maximize their kids health but not lose the flavor and fun of food. spices are not spicy, they’re health boosting and delicious. i love spice momma’s creative recipes and can’t wait for more from her.",1
This blade worked well for a little while (had this item for a little over a month) and then it snapped off as I was opening a box with it. Would not recommend.,0
"I would love to write a review, however, I never received my order.",0
The color is not what I would call dark Navy. Or I should say the shirts I received. They look more like a mix of gray and blue not dark anything.. The size is good and they fit. I kept them as the color does not make much of a difference to me. Ron,1
Made a high difference on my metal table.,1
Missing the 4 reality cards??,0
"I’ve replaced all shoe laces on my toddler’s shoes with these. So far we’ve lost 4 end clips, no matter what we do they keep coming off and getting lost. Worth buying only for the elastic laces; I’ll stick to Lock Laces from now on.",0
Stopped rotating after 3 weeks...,0
Very easy to install. Took me no more than 30 minutes total. They look amazing! The only reason why I gave them 4 stars is the fact that I noticed a little bit of flex in the steps when I use them. I'm 230 pounds so I wouldn't recommend them for anyone significantly heavier than that. This is for my wife's lifted Jeep so it is more than enough for her. The stars on the step plates are a perfect touch.,1
add makes u think your getting right and left bearings,0
Work as needed. Make sure the straps are very tight! They tend to roll on the side and get your shoes in what you are trying not to get them in.,1
These coins are very small so I returned it wasn't that cool,0
"I really wanted to like this, but i can’t get it to work with an OtterBox defender. When I place my phone on it, it charges for a few seconds but then it stops, waits a few seconds, tries again, and goes back off. The ledge it sits on is also a little small and doesn’t like to hold my phone on there. I haven’t had any luck horizontally either. The stand looks really nice on my nightstand though. The charger did work for me without a case, so I may buy a thinner case to be able to work with the charger.",0
Poor quality. Would not recommend.,0
Never received the item.,0
"Love these earbuds so much I’ve gone through several pairs over the last year or so. The fit is the best I’ve had and that’s why I keep coming back to them. The sound is decent for the price, though I usually listen to podcasts rather than music. Batteries are not great but customer service is quite good. I’ve had to replace several pairs but Anker has made it fairly painless to do so.",0
"I bought the tie-dyed version and it was SO comfortable. Stretchy breathable material. I decided to buy the black version for work. Bad decision! The material is completely different. It doesn’t stretch, it’s not breathable and it is very small and uncomfortable! It even seems it’s stitched differently so that it coveres 50% less of my head. So disappointing!!",0
This was cute and sturdy and perfect for our kids event.,1
Looks and feels like there's no protector installed but these things chip very easily. The 3rd one broke the same day I installed it. Worthless! Hope I can find a vinyl alternative and not tempered glass.,0
Doesn’t work at all! Took family to the camping trip and used this product hoping to avoid mosquito bites. Instead getting bitten all over.,0
"Excellent workmanship, beautiful appearance, and just the right size, installation is simple, special and stable. It can put a lot of things such as the usual utensils, dishes, and cups however, the biggest advantage is that it can save space.",1
These leggings are super soft and true to size I host a big xmas eve so this is the perfect holiday cheer outfit while still remaining comfy while hosting amd cooking,1
This is a nice set. Everything you need to get started. Lots of seeds so if some don’t start you have more to try. I planed my seeds 4 weeks ago and some of them still haven’t come up I’m going to give them another week then add more seeds see if they will Come up. But all in all it’s a great starter set.,1
Very easy to use. Intuitive to operate. Sharp image. Includes fittings and accessories.,1
Much smaller than expected and product box was damaged and looked like someone used Scotch tape to try to reseal it. Was embarrassed to give this as a gift due to condition received.,0
"I absolutely love how minimal this case is. I have tried three different cases for the Pixel 3xl and this one is my favorite. The only small changes I would like to see is an ever-so-slightly higher raised edge to help protect the front screen and a more beveled fingerprint circle to allow a more seamless scan of the fingers. Definitely the case for those that want their phone to look like it doesn't have a case (if the phone is black). Mine did crack while trying to take it off the phone once, but ESR quickly replaced it free of charge within a few days. Update: Got a replacement case from ESR and this one also cracked within a couple months (no drops). The crack appeared in the same place as the previous one. I'm giving up on this case and moving to a different one. Dropping review to 2-stars",0

"My fiancée loves his ring. Its great for the price, but it changed from rose gold to yellow gold in a matter of weeks. Kinda sad because we got it to math my rose gold ring. But still, it’s a nice weight, and very durable. Would recommend but not if you’re looking for a rose gold ring.",1
Falls out of the socket a lot. Not very sturdy either,0
"These feel cheap, like more like they should have been in the 20-30 dollar range. So yeah, these are a no go. The sound is uhh... That's okay. But if you have a big head, you're gonna suffer a great deal from how harsh of a clamp these have.",0
"Liking the durability and feel of this comforter. It did shrink a tiny bit when I washed and dried it, but that worked out for us.",1

"Nice product, enough space to hold all of my essential accessories but the mesh tore away from the elastic after just 6 weeks of use leaving one pocket useless.",0
"It's big, but the colors are awful. Throwing away not worth it to return",0
Very comfortable and warm gloves.I bought these for very cold winter motorcycling.I wore them yesterday on a 50 minute ride in 20 degrees F and not one bit of cold sensation got to my hand.,1

Bought 2 and one does not work turns off then turns off would like a replacement.,0
"First of all I'd like to know who got the devilish idea to add pockets to all dresses sold on Amazon. This is a really nightmare! The dress fit, and it's beautiful but because I do have large hips as an hourglass shape, the pockets make me look even larger. This is so disheartening. I hope I'll find a nice dress for my next trip to Jamaica!",0
"Do not read the old reviews that rave this product. The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old. Though I'm not sure how well you can tell the difference in thickness of the wire.",0
"Just took it out of the box today and noticed the carrying strap is ripped. Seems like a nice chair, but I’m not happy about the strap. It would be nice if the company could replace the strap without having to ship back the chair.",0
"Smell is nice, but did nothing for my pesky plantar warts on the bottom of my feet. However, people respond to essential oils differently, so it could work for someone else.",0
"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased. The vacuum seal bag can be re-used and the seller included a really cute thank you note which was a great touch.",1
Very nice dress! Cute and comfortable.,1
The case seems to be doing a decent job of protecting my phone but it is not very well made. It is difficult to take off and put back on. Overall feels like cheap construction. The kickstand is awful to work with. Once it's open and locked open you have to find the perfect way to close it or it doesn't work. Fingerprint sensor ends up awkwardly deep because the case adds about a quarter inch of thickness to the back. Overall very dissatisfied with this case,0
"Wig is super soft and very pretty. Only issue is that it’s a bit small, other than that it looks and feels great.",1
"I put this together, and my pup went right in. I put a crate pad in it, and now it's his favorite place to go.",1
Love it... exactly what is described.. If i had enough bathrooms i would have one in every color.,1
Cool product but did not last long. I wish I can contact a buyer to see if they can send me a new one.,0
Didn't work. Food not crisped at all - even though I tried multiple times raising both temperature and cook time.,0
"This was a simply written. There was enough discription of each charactor. There were a lot of characters that you had to keep straight through out the book. The story centered around a group of retired SWAT team officers and invading China and North Korean armies. There was a little bit of the story dealing with and history of how and why their was an invasion, not more about anything further. The editor and proof reader needed to spend more time reviewing the book, alot of missing words through the story. So I'm wondering if Mr. Moore will continue the story.",1
"Not quite sure, but I am consuming it with black Maca powder. I do feel more energy and better erection... Maybe you should try it as I am.",1
Great lightweight large hoop earrings. I love them & recommend them. They were received quickly & were as expected.,1
"I like everything about the wig except the color, and that’s my fault for not looking carefully enough. It would look better on a woman of color or an olive complexion or even a younger person. The base color is black rather than brown, which is what I need. Still, the style is cute, very spiky and ther is a lot of hair so that it could be trimmed or thinned if you wanted.",1
I measured as instructed and these did not fit.,0
Just what I expected. Just in the worst colors imaginable. Will work for storage of my 3D glasses.,0
failed after six months . Warranty replacement is impossible so far !,0
Does not work mixed this with process solution and 000 and nothing. Looked exactly the same as i first put it on.,0
"Great quality, but I’m not sure it’ll actually slim me down in the long run. I mostly wear it as a back brace at work.",1
"This strap is very loose fitting, defeats the purpose...no matter how tight I pull it...it does not work and I hv a sizable head...don't t like it..waste of $$$...sending it back...",0
"This is a great Amazon product. I haven't found anything that I don't use it for. I use it to cook, to work out, to look up information and many more things. The weather is one of the things I use everyday on the Show along with the alarm feature. This is a must have item!!!!",1
I wanted to like this so bad. There were more good reviews than bad so I gave it a shot. If you have thick course hair or are mixed I don’t recommend this. I kept applying it maybe 3 times and there is still hair there. I tried it on my lip since that’s not as thick and it still left hair on my lip. So bottom line: if you have thinner hair then I recommend this but if you’re of mixed race like me with thick hair then don’t waste your money.,0
"Shit product, does not work. Messy and a comic, just get regular seed.",0
The stickers are too small and the quality is not good.,0
The quality is terrible. The screen was glued on crooked which gave me a crooked picture. The glare/reflection on the screen is too much for my liking. Don't let the pictures advertising it fool you. It doesn't look anything like it's being advertised. I'm sending it back.,0
did not receive instructions in english; I have no idea how to use this product,0
The closures seems like they would open unintentionally very easily. They don't seem to seal well.,0
On the picture the dress looked like it had flare at the bottom turns out it doesn't. It is just a straight dress that is high in the front and low in the back. Not what I expected,0
No information on how to operate,0
This film was so slow and uneventful it deserves to be listed only as a lullaby! The acting was brutally amateurish and the script was something a four year old would write. The other reviews that are anything above a two star are obviously from people associated with its production. Don't waste your time.,0
"The first one I purchased is actually in Japan. I had a very good experience of using it. Not too big, not too small, just the right size. It can keep water warm for a very long time, the edge of the cup mouth is smooth and clean. I lost the first one in one trip and come to get this as the second one, it is just as good as the first one.",1
This book arrived bent out of shape and with a some type of stain on it.,0
"The case works well and charges the phone quickly. However, it is bulky and a headphone adapter is needed to use the headphone jack. The case comes with the adapter but be prepared to carry it with you when you want to use headphones.",0

"Got this for a coworker - bright colors, good quality, and she started using it immediately!",1
"It’s uneven between the 2 sides, & the teeth aren’t cut all up. Edges of the teeth are sharp, but I filed it down w sandpaper & that helped.",0
Good holder all around. Only thing I didn't love was the Plastic Clip seems cheap.,1
"Adorable! Great story about friendship, finding happiness and love in all its forms, and standing up to bullies. :) Good life lessons for all ages and the illustrations are spot on.",1
Its smaller than what I expected but gives a decent amount of perfectly cooked rice (perfect for 1 or 2 persons). Its easy to clean and takes up very little space. Good product for low price. Highly recommended!,1
Definitely not waterproof! The bulb filled up with water when it rained. Now it doesnt work. It looks pretty and if you plan on keeping it somewhere dry it's worth the purchase. However I needed something that was weather resistant and it didnt last a week.,0
Poor quality. Very disappointed. I usually love the Zebra pens. The pen inside the case already had chipped marks on the design.,0
Have never recieved the product. Had zero communication with vendor thats even after I emailed them twice. No way to run a business,0
"I certainly must have got a fake Sebastian! Purchased this for its reputable name however I am so disappointed, it does not hold my hair and the smell is dreadful. Never want to buy this product again. Please check details before you buy!",0
"It's a magnet, haven't used yet, but expect it to hold keys.",1
"very over priced for the size of the product, but my grandson loved it",0
If what you need is something for few tools you’re just gonna throw in the truck or your trunk it’s perfect.,1
One of the 5 cords received is already broken. The other 4 have hardly been used. The one that’s broken has only been used moderately and it already stopped charging.,0
"The wig in the picture looks nothing like what I received. It's too big, no combs to support wearing it and the adjusting does not help with my size of head. I'm going to try to work with it, because I wear wigs regularly, however I do not plan to purchase this particular one again. I do not recommend this wig, if you are a new beginner with wearing wigs.",0
The original package was opened and taped shut. When I went to return the item it said “this item can’t be returned.”,0
Great book for daily living,1
nice video and sound,1
Sturdiness or lack of,0
I liked this book for its raw grittiness and drama. Lyric went through several ups and downs and betrayals but kept it real. The book was a quick and easy read. Remember folks- Write a review to help an author out.,1
Arrived in time however the product do not numb your throat with one spray and I’m not sure if I should spray until it’s numb (direction states 1 spray),1
Tried it more than 3 times....didn’t work at all,0
I wish I could give 0 stars. We used baby dry when my son was a newborn and they worked great. Bought these and the first one I put on 2 mom later my son is screaming his head off. I finally make the connection and take the diaper off and he has BURNS all over his bottom. DONT BUY,0
Life saver with kids and locks!,1
never stayed connected to wifi. Unusable,0
"Bought two of these for international travel and have not been disappointed in the slightest. I'm currently sitting in a hotel room charging a Surface Pro 6 using the PD port and an adapter, plus an iPhone Xs Max from the QC 3.0 port, plus an iPhone 8 from one of the regular USB ports, and it's handling all three with no issue whatsoever. (It's pretty warm, I probably wouldn't leave the room with all that stuff plugged in, but if you're in the room anyway, it's no issue at all.)",1
"My daughter has been begging me for these glasses forever so I finally ordered them for her and she LOVES them... I do too! They are so cute and great quality. I thought they were gonna be cheaply made, but they are not! I recommend these! Very stylish! My other daughters boyfriend is even ordering a pair for himself...",1
I bought two sets. In White. One came with a couple light brown stains. Maybe dirt. Who knows. The lining plastic package was torn. Washed them immediately after arrival with TIDE & dirt removed! So I didn’t have to return it! The fabric does NOT puff up. Looks brand new even after wash! VERY SOFT! Wrinkle free as noted!!! Very white after washing with plain blue Tide detergent. Will buy again!!! AND AGAIN!! THANK YOU!!!,1
"I bought this item with very high hopes. I inoperable the box, use the tap measure function and the metal piece breaks completely off. It then retracted back into the device and is no unusable. The laser light itself should be in a fix position and it’s difficult to relabel it. The instructions are poorly written and does not cover set up. Avoid this item if possible",0
It will help a lot driving there. It helps too on the travel planning before going to New Zealand.,1
Serves the purpose of what I needed this for. I just bought it to hold a set of drapes in a doorway. Just wish it had better staying tension because If you pull the drapes too hard you may pull the pole down too.,1
Holy Crap what a Cliffy! Loved this book from beginning to end and is my absolute favorite so far! Can’t wait for book 4!,1
I don’t know how this item is because I never RECEIVED IT!! I haven’t received anything that I ordered except the silk pajamas and the trench coat and the sexual toys. And I’m guessing cause they were placed in my mailbox!! I haven’t received my scooter nor the car!! I want my money back I don’t even want a delivery anymore!!,0
"A total piece of crap!!! I bought it in June 2019, tested it when I got it, put it in a drawer. It sat there until now, end of October. When I needed it to use it, it's dead as a door nail! DO NOT TOUCH THIS ITEM!!!",0
I loved this show and was so disappointed when it was cancelled after six seasons.,1
"I have to admit when I first got this and tried it, it seemed like it totally didn't work. I even had a hard time getting it into the device. I tried to instantly crimp the portion of the blind that was damaged and it didn't change it. It still looked damaged and bent. I was beginning to think 'what a waste of money.' I went away for a few minutes about to call Home Depot to see if they simply had new blinds in stock. Then I stopped myself and thought I'd better give it at least one last try. This time I held the damaged part in the device at a curve and held it for about 30-40 seconds. When I released it it had made it significantly better this time. Then I did kind of the same thing in three little areas on the same damaged part again to try and clean it up a bit more. I would say that made it better by another 20%. I think the key here is you have to hold the damaged part curved in the device for at least 40 seconds, maybe even pushing your thumb along it, and then kind of focus more on the nuanced parts of the same damage portion to try and clean it up after the first attempt. I would say if you are a patient person and are willing to treat the process as a kind of microscopic surgery to an extent as opposed to a job you can complete instantly then I think you'll appreciate this device. If the blinds are still hanging it's basically a situation of pulling up a chair for a good half hour and getting to work like a craftsman on them. Maybe you can speed up the process as you get good at it but just prepare yourself to treat it as if you were about to carve a small wood sculpture. It is rewarding though once you see them sort of come back to life. To add, this really works best on blinds that have been bent simply at a 90 degree angle rather than those that are actually mangled and bumpy. Like I said with the bumps it really takes a bit of work and nuanced focus to get those looking decent again.",1
Good information about the servants in the White House. The president home has an intriguing history.,1

"We bought the crib from Buy Buy Baby without the bed side rails about 6 years ago. Glad to see the rails were still available. Very easy to convert, once I got the crib apart. The foot board doesn't feel super stable, but our kids have jumped on the bed and it's held fine. Now we just need our 3 year old to use *this* bed instead of *our* bed.",1
This product had sketchy packaging. I requested a refund and now return label won't print. I need this seller to contact me ASAP. Thanks!,0
First time ordering from this company. Not packed well at all All 3 caps were broken.,0
I cant believe how easy to install these steps were. We absolutely love them. I wish I had known about them sooner.,1
Do not like the elastic waist at all. Very uncomfortable. Material is thin but soft.,0
"I love the colors of this dice set! However, a lot of the white paint paint is chipping from the dots. I have one dot that is completely missing on a dot which is crappy. I will try a paint pen on it and hopefully that works well on the dice!",1
Didn't even stick to my phone! Waste of money!,0
This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product. I did however have a bit of confusion in the beginning because the instructions were not clear so I googled. You guys might have to google too if you've never used a garlic press before.,1
"These are okay headphones, they are what I expected for the price so I'm happy with them.",1
Like the round package as fits nicely everywhere and handy in car. More expensive but worth it.,1
"I like knowing it will not leave nasty glue all over my windows when I stop using the film when I finally get around to picking window treatments. I did have small air bubbles pop up around the edges when the temp went below freezing outside which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Not very noticeable, worth it for the film being easier to install and remove than the type with glue!",1
I bought these for a Nerf battle birthday party for my son. We put buckets of these bullets out on the battlefield and they worked great! Highly recommend!,1

"Stiff,short, hard to swat. Like slapping metal around",0
"I took note of the reviews that said the clock just stopped working, but decided to try it anyway because of its looks. And make no mistake, it is very good looking. Unfortunately it does not work. I even tried replacing the first fresh battery with another fresh battery. It ran for 2 hours and stopped again. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Howard Miller changed their supplier for their clock movements. The low-cost provider can become very expensive if you have to handle a lot of returns and your brand is damaged.",0

"The features are nice, when they work, which is infrequently. The Bluetooth range is short, which is fine. we all know what we're getting into with the Bluetooth game. My issue is the device will fail silently and get 'stuck' on a temperature and gives the user absolutely no indication that anything has gone wrong. I have tried it 3x for smoking meat and it has failed in this way about 10 times. each time the only way i can figure it out is to notice that the temp stays the same for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, and then I must power cycle the device and force close and reopen the app. After i do this it starts working again. Unreliable garbage.",0
An Auto shut-off would be great...bottle gets too hot if you don’t stand in front of the warmer to watch. Which defeats the purpose of having a bottle warmer in the first place...,0
When I first received the TV the volume was a little off. There was a voice telling you when the volume was turn up and down and her voice was louder than the TV. Once I got into settings and figured it out with the help of some young people the volume is perfect. It is a pretty good TV so far,1

Used these on my wedding cake! Turned out beautiful!,1
These are great for SO many things. Originally I had them in my drink at a club but then later bought them for my wedding center pieces. The light stays on for weeks but becomes dim after 3 or 4 days. We had a great time leaving the extra ones around the party and will use the extra ones for fun.,1

"I got that as a Christmas present for a 4 year old. For adults it's ok to put together but for a 4 year old not, it is to difficult to clip them together. The led lights would work only for a couple of days and then only partially. Out of 5 cars only 2 work ok, the others are very slow even with new batteries. It hurts to watch them struggling around the tracks and praying they make the round while the 2 strong cars crash into the slow once and push them around. All in all good idea but didn't go through quality control for sure. Big disappointment!",0
"I read the reviews and other than folks who were putting the thing on backwards (the holes won't line up!!), the most common complaints are the screws are too soft and that the screws are too long and bind up the bolt. I did not run into either of these problems. I screwed the base down, mounted some rings, and away I went. Works great and was an inexpensive solution. Is it super high end?? No. Is it adequate for what's likely 99% of the users out there? In my opinion, yes.",1
"Rating based on the following - product as described and quick shipping. At the time of rating this product, I have not used it so I’m unable to verify how well it works for my needs. It looks better than a previous product purchased from a different seller that didn’t hold up after 3 uses. Hoping this product will be much better :)",1
"My son was so excited to receive this gift from Santa. He had been asking for it for 3 months. He opened it Christmas day and it was the first toy he played with. It stopped working after two hours. Cheaply made product with a big price tag. Based on the reviews here, the problem seems similar. This product should not be sold for more than $7.00.",0
"I thought this would help me, keep my phone in my pocket and I can use my phone but not so fast, they advertise like it is an Apple Watch but not even close. Just get an Apple Watch if you use your phone like me all the time",0
"So this product is pretty useless when it arrives and the pin isn’t sharp at all. It’s a flat end, when shown as a sharpened end.",0
"Let me start by saying that I really liked the look of these, however as others have stated, these are much narrower than the standard croc. I don't have especially wide feet, but I could not wear these. I could tell blisters were starting to form just from wearing these around the house for a little while. Others heated them up and re-molded them, but I wasn't about to try that so I had to return them.",0
I wanted to take these for at least a month before writing the review. They did help with some of the symptoms of PCOS BUT I wanted it to help me ovulate and instead I've been spotting for 3 days 2 weeks after taking them. My periods are normally regular so I've never done this before. My period wasn't due for another week when I started spotting. Disappointed):,0
It was great the first few weeks. Now the bag is falling apart. Received august 20. Today is october 2 and bag is now coming apart . Only ever had 1 racket and 1 pair of shoes kept in there. Still looks new. *Zipper broke *Handle broke *Ripped near zipper area can't close.,0
I ordered this 2 pack a couple of months ago for my Black and Decker blower and trimmer. They will not charge. The black and decker charger flashes red indicating a bad battery (both). I unfortunately did not try these until after the return window closed. Out of luck!!!,0
Great straps for short sets. They do slip but if you like to space out your sets then you have plenty of time to adjust them,1
The time I ordered it until I received it was good. I felt the shipping cost was too much. Can not verify the effectiveness of this product until I take it for some time.,1
For me it was a very disconnected story. Didn’t pull me In. And not a lot of takeaways that will linger in my mind long after that last page. Not a fan.,0
A really nice razor . Gives a close shave. The battery lasts a long time but you cannot shave while it is charging.,1
What I liked most is that the ink cartridge actually worked!,1
The best litter scoop we've had works great and is nice and large and looks like it will last forever. Feels like the metal handle ends at the bend so I tend to hold it just below the bend where it feels sturdy.,1
"Great product, one of he flowers did fall off",1
I guess I did not receive a new one since it wasn’t even packaged properly and came with a child’s ripped drawing inside...,0
Chemical reaction is spot on but the applicator is cardboard so wear gloves as it tends to leak into the cardboard before it reaches the end of the swab.,1
These are not soft or flexible on the ear at all! Worried I will damage my ear using them and they don't work to massage the ear as it says either!,0
"Product does not include instructions, but turning the shaft changes the frequency. Does nothing to quiet the dog next door, but when I blow it in the house, my wife barks.",0
Came in ripped at the seems. Did not send back to avoid extra fees associated in the terms and conditions included in the package.,0
"Very cute, but it came broken, very disappointing",0
Fit great. Only had one pillow case. Expected two. Had a funny industrial order when out of the box but was fine after washed and dried.,1
"I am not a fan of how works with my OtterBox, one side of the protective screen is up and I can't get it to sit flat with my case. It was definitely easy to install, but I don't think it's very adhesive.",0
Nothing special at all about this product... the book is too small and stiff and hard to write in. The huge sticker on the back doesn’t come off and looks super tacky. I would not purchase this again. I could have just bought a journal from the dollar store and it would be basically the same thing. It’s also really expensive for what it is.,0
"Great, but knocked off a star because it needs locking wheels. I bought it for a printer and when the printer is actually printing documents the cart rolls around my wooden office floor.",1
"Now that I know, the line in the base to line up the number of the roof pitch was near impossible for me to see with my not to good site. Now I found it after I finished 95% of the install process. All was great, except for that detail. It works just great, I'm sure it will help with the heat buildup. Please make a better mark in the base. I will probably never install another for the rest of my life. This was my first. I'm 65.",1
"Just received this bag yesterday. It is very cute and looks like it will hold up. There are several pockets inside and outside of the bag which is nice. The beige top of the bag arrived with several black spots on it. Some wiped clean and I’m hoping the others will come off with some soap. Looks like it may have happened during packaging. It’s a bummer that it came dirty but the outer material is easy to wipe down! It is a good size, will hold a lot without being cumbersome!",1
Got a screen didn’t worked reorder it and still didn’t work trash screen,0
"While this product broke and I had originally written a negative review, customer service of this company reached out to me and gave me a full refund, so I am quite happy! The actual ottoman was great before it unfortunately broke on me.",1
"Does curl my hair initially and they look great too, but even with hairspray my curls fall within the hour. I get better results curling with my straightener. I would think it is just my hair but I have had it curled and stayed all night many other times so it must be the curling iron.",0
Like it just wish it was precut,1
The sole inside the shoe does not stay in place which makes it difficult and bothersome to put the shoe on and off.,0
Great shield for the price and you get two! Was in fact bubble free and easy to install! And lifetime warranty can’t beat it!,1
I waste of my money.,0
"Just what I wanted, fingers crossed it will hold up too lots of use!",1
Very flattering leggings. I am 5ft 4inches and 150 pounds and ordered a Large. They are not too tight and fit me perfectly. I love the fact that they are mainly cotton. The material is thick enough to not be see-through and not thin like t-shirt fabric. You could size down if you like a snugger fit.,1
I have heard of these ultrasonic pest control gadgets but have never used them before. I was tired of using chemicals to get rid of my bug and rodent problem. I have a cabin in the woods and we will get mice from time to time. I have now had this installed now for several weeks and no sign of anything. Usually when we go away for a few day and find some dropping when we return. Nothing yet so far. I am hopeful. There is no sound or odor. If the critters stay gone I'll change my review to a 5 star.,1
The size was perfect! The quality is very good and held up during our very windy nights.,1
The pair I bought in the store for my girlfriend seemed like they were better. These headphones ended losing their Bluetooth capabilities. And after a few hard workouts the speaker lost power and was quiet.,0
Stupid ! The ball goes everywhere then you want it to go.,0
Was not big enough for what I needed it for. Not bright enough.,0
I did not receive this item with my other items that were all in the same box,0
"Holes all over the dress, terrible!!!",0
Only had it a week and true to un clasp it and it broke,0
Very cute workout tanks. The material seems good. They are much smaller than expected. I wear a medium and they fit like a small. Order a size up if you don’t want it tight and form fitting.,1
The only place this top fit me was at the bottom around the hips. The top was way too baggy and the neckline hung down on my chest.,0
we put these rugs in the front of our tent they work great collecting all the dirt so it does not get into the tent.,1
The light was easily assembled.... I had it up in about 15 minutes. Powered it up and I was in business. It has been running about a week or so and no problems to date.,1
"This is super cute. It has a drawstring under the chin to adjust to your dog’s head size. The tail piece is too small for my dog but he is missing the tip of his tail so the end of his tail is thick, not tapered. The mane probably won’t stay on for long but my dog won’t tolerate it for long anyway. I gave it 4 stars because it’s not as fuzzy as the main picture would have you think.",1
I like it is solid and also easy to apply on my baby. Also the ingredients are organic and natural. However after I start using them. I realized it have something hard plastic SHARP in the middle of the stick!! I almost make a big scratch on my baby's face! The design of this stick is TERRIBLE!,0
Not exactly original equipment. Similar but not the same as the originals. Not that pleased. The photo made it look like the original. They were not at all like the originals.,0
Just a nice product overall!,1
Seems very durable for so many pockets,1
"Works just as well (if not better) than it's name-brand ""cousin"" at about 1/3rd of the price!",1
Requires long term use to make decision.,1
Box came damaged. Looks like someone opened it prior to sending it to me. Pop is okay.,0
They break/Rip very easy,0
Had better results with older pair. Cat has gone on a killing spree lately.,0
"My son loves this mat! The only issue I had was that it's not a doodle mat, there is no space for them to draw, it is just hidden dinosaurs, which for my son was amazing.",1
If you are looking for something to listen to the radio on beware that radio doesn't have an external antenna on it. I wouldn't have bought this one if I had realized that.,0
I’m 5’10” weigh 155 lbs Did I order a juvenile one because this thing seems small I don’t know how anybody bigger than me could use this..,0
"These cables are junk. After 6 months, all three have failed and will no longer charge our phones. Amazon would not take them back and told us to contact the manufacturer.",0
"So, this wrench slips. I couldn't get it to grip anything unless I put a thin piece of cloth between it and what I was trying to wrench. Not sure if you are supposed to do that, but I really needed to wrench something on something. Left me cold though if I needed to wrench something ""off""!",0
Great product. Works as advertised. Ensure you format prior to internally installing to avoid headaches. Use the standard USB to SATA cable to externally format. I installed in a 2012 Macbook Pro.,1
This does not work. I have a c cable that I wanted to use this with. You can’t even get the plug in.it’s made too small,0
"With no experience to draw from and only going from recommendations from others as to the weight of the BB's, I purchased this brand based on the number of positive reviews and the price/quantity. So far no issues...",1
I thought it was the large tube that I usually buy..the price sticker on the 2 pack had a $5 price sticker yet it cost alot more and not sure why. Otherwise it is a good product. It is a much better deal to buy it and Bath and Body Works!,0
"I liked that Lee Strobel talked to people who had experienced miracles and did not write about them. I have read most of his “The Case For” books. They were all good, but this was the best.",1
"Great case, kept most of the drops from cracking my phone (the protective glass screen now has a crack from dropping it, but my phone itself has still been pretty well protected). If you’re a fidgeter like me, the sliding compartment on the back does not stay closed very well after some usage. I had to superglue mine shut, but that was more my own fault than the case’s.",1
Only 6 of the 12 lights were included...,0
Fantastic piece of jewelry and love the packaging and promptness of getting the jewelry! Thank you so VERY much! VERY PLEASED!,1
this never showed up,0
My fault for not looking at the dimensions before purchasing. It's SO small.,0
This review is not for the product its for the seller. There was a mistake on there part and I didn't receive the right product . Would have been too much of a hassle for me to return. Gave the tablet form vitamins to a friend. This product does work.,0
Basic rubber flip flop. Good for beach or around the house.,1
Noticeable difference in my nails with regular use. Good product! Highly recommended,1
"This is a superb wallet! I love the texture, design and size. All my business cards and checks fit in it perfectly. I will probably buy it again.",1
"Uncomfortable, seemed ineffective with vague instructions. Waste of money.",0
"I’m writing this review at 3:45 AM after taking 3 of these. I love my Natures Bounty Melatonin, they work.",0
Didn’t get product in a tub like it shows... it was 2 seal bags and it didn’t look the same,0
nice easel and very sturdy,1
The animal print is great and realistic. I just wish instead of the whole cats face its just the cats mouth.,1
"Nice clean acceleration. Didn't really get a noticeable boost in mpg, but might be a little better that might one day justify the cost. Doesn't sound like it's straining while at idle any longer.",1
"Very easy to set up, took about 5 minutes or less. Small but big enough for children under 6",1
"I used it only twice and when the sidewalk ended, it went out and didn't turn on anymore. I did not buy it. Do not throw your money",0
The Slippers are cute the size just runs a bit small.,0
This thing is a piece of crap and started falling apart a day after I put it on the phone. I'll find a better one at the dollar store.,0
I received white rose lights instead of the pink ones I ordered.,1
It was working fine for the first 3 months after purchased. But after that I need to change battery every month and now it does not dispense any more soap. That is a design flaw where the soap will dry up and block the soap dispense hole.,0
The screen protector was delivered promptly and so far no issues with cracking and it has protected our phone. It's only been a week since we installed them. Not much use from them yet. Be glad to do review in a month or 2.,1
"Fast delivery, easy to use, we'll built, very impressed.",1
This story was absolutely fantastic! Everything was fascinating the characters were so good that I could not put it down! The heroin was amazing. I really enjoyed this story!,1
"The picture shown is of an assembled finished piece. The item is well made and beautifully painted, but comes unassembled; I assume since there are 24 small toys, this is so the toys can be put in the compartments and one taken out each day to complete the display at the end of advent, which is why it comes unassembled. However, the toys are very small and fall over easily, especially when you wind the base to play the music. I also feel they could easily be lost, so I glued the pieces down to make them permanent and will put fun treats; i.e., Hershey kisses, miniature peanut butter cups, etc. in the compartments. The compartments are small, each holding about 2 Hershey kisses, so if you want to put gift cards or larger candies in them, it will not work. Not all fun size candy bars will fit.",1
Good price and fits nicely in small apartment. This was the second table sent to me as it was damaged by deliver driver. I don’t think it was packed very well which made it more vulnerable. The second table was also damaged but in a place less visible. It also stains very easily.,0
"I had the same problem as the other reviewers, it keeps losing connection which is very annoying. We got this bulb for the nursery - you just leave the lamp turned ""on"" so you can control the bulb. Every time the power has gone out the bulb comes back on (because the lamp is in the on position) which is horrible for our nursery - this always seems to happen w/storms in the middle of the night. It has lost connection and needed to be re-added several times so we've given up on it. We have several smart outlets but this was our first smart bulb. We will just get another smart outlet instead. Sad, we wanted to be able to turn the light on/off w/voice when we have our hands full w/baby.",0
"So funny, great for binge watching",1
Came as ordered - everything works fine,1
Works great! Easy to use and fast. Huge game changer for packaging cookies in my home bakery!,1
Was exactly what I needed!!!,1
I returned it because it did not work!,0
"This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around. What I like about this device is that Selfie don't need to raise your hand far just to get a good picture and struggle pressing that button for the camera. Another thing about this device is that it comes with an extra holder to the bluetooth clicker and you either put it on the stick or your finger, but it is better to put it on the stick for a long range selfie. Another thing i notice about this Universal Wireless bluetooth Camera is that the plus (+) and the minus (-) sign can also work to take a picture. I think it is serve to zoom in zoom out but for my S8 it works as to take a snap shot picture. Design it look sleek and doesn't look cheap to look at. When it comes to emergency photo with a group good to have it around.",1
"As a cosplayer I own a numerous amount of wigs. I've never had a wig have this much fallout. I couldnt even style it without pulling out chunks of hair. Save yourself some heartache, time and money. Buy the more expensive wig.",0
My husband is unsteady and this cup holder Keeps his drink stable. He is more confident to have his drink no matter where we are?,1
It does not have glass. It's Plastic !. It breaks easily! poor quality,0
Gets the job done the way it needs to.,1
Product is as described.,1
"Very compactable and light weight. The stakes are durable and tie out points are well made. Wish it had a few more tie outs on the sides. Mine only came with one on each corner, one in the middle of each side and a center tie out. Used this as a lean-to shelter over my tent. The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch.",1
I love them but smaller than I thought. Bought the medium and had to send back and exchanged for Large.,1
I bought the 18 lb weighted blanket and I love it! Haven't slept a day without since I got it over a month ago. I have anxiety and it helps me fall asleep much quicker at night.,1
When it arrived and I sat it down on the table it was very unbalanced and the feet on it was uneven. Scared to use thinking it’s gonna fall over and burn my house down!,0
"like the product ,was supposed to be a surprise gag gift. but now the suprise was spoiled since our email is a shared email address.Not good!",1
"Doesn’t work! It quacks but that’s it, doesn’t even attempt to blow bubbles. Will return! Very disappointed as this was part of my son’s Easter basket!",0
Nice quality but little empty inside and the adhesive is white which is looks bad on my car from side !Should make the adhesive black for the black emblem .,0
"These are good pants for just walking outside or lounging and such. They are not anything special, but they get the job done. The do get a bit more snug after wash/dry.",1
plush My wife ended up buying 2 more,1
These flavors are blah! I’ve had these same flavors from different brands and enjoyed them but these are gross.,0
"Very pleased overall. I'm glad I tried these on at a local store before ordering on Amazon though. Per the sizing guide, it recommended medium. I have average to small hands but had to order a large. It's still pretty tight around the thumbs when trying to take them off. Very sturdy gloves with Velcro that stays put. Protect hands very well even with aggressive weight lifting.",1
too much political talk,1
"I store equipment in an old barn / shed and do not want rodents chewing wires / destroying other stuff. The old D-con pellets always worked well but when they went to bait blocks the mice just laughed and ignored them. While you must now buy a gigantic bucket, it is good to see that the pellets are still available. Yes, use common sense and do not put them out where kids or pets might find them but, unlike the blocks, these do work",1
"Very disappointed, I thought the panels were plastic, but it's soft material, and no good for kids bedroom they will destroy this in a day. Also the doors don't close properly the magnets sucks, the instructions are crap. Right after I build it it practically loosened up moving to another room. Waste of money. not worth it I don't recommend it.",0
I used this product in combination with my diet/ exercise to help lean down. Both products were a great addition and I could tell I dropped much needed water weight .,1
"Update on this delonghi heater This past December 2017 The heater caught on fire. The plastic melted into my carpet and damaged the rug and it has to be replaced. The electrical mechanical smoke smell still lingers after several weeks of trying to clean walls, cabinets and furniture. I googled delonghi heaters catching on fire and found references to this problem along with recalls. I called delonghi several times and was put on long hold several times. Promises to return my phone call did not occur. Each time I call I am told it is being handled by a different person. Well it is sure safe but it takes several hours to heat up and starts to warm up my sewing studio. Actually I have to put it near me so I feel a little bit warm. I live in the sc. I decided I would look for an electric heater with a fan this year. I a",0
Only lasted 2 months!,0
FIRE HAZARD DO NOT PURCHASE. Used once as instructed wires melted and caught fire!!!,0
I bought 3 as stocking stuffers for my family for Christmas and a well or two later it stopped working. Very disappointing. I was hoping it would be great for the kids to use while multitasking but unfortunately I was wrong,0
"I was so excited about this popcorn, but it turned out to be a disappointment. You are better off buying truffle oil on your own and just adding it to the sunflower oil in the sea salt variety, that 's what I normally do. There just isn't much flavor to it and though I absolutely know less is more with truffle oil, they took that a bit too far with this one.",0
This ring is beautiful but turned colors within the first month. Will never buy again,0
Daughter loves them. Fits perfect.,1
I use to get these all the time. I missed them till I found them here. Do not like hot. These are perfect.,1
"Works. And so easy to stow, transport. We all love it. I see another in our future.",1
Gave me horrible gas. Did not like taste.,0
This product worked ok when I first got it but there was always feed back. I’ve had it 2 months now and it no longer works at all. Waste of money.,0
"The suction cup is the worst quality I’ve seen, I’ve tried multiple times to stick it to my dashboard however any little bump it falls right off. I will definitely return this",0
These arrived healthy and green I attached them to rock and they took off beautiful Thanks seller,1
$2.50 for 1 Qt of milk? Too Expensive for powdered milk!,0
"The paint on these blocks makes them a bit slick. We’re having trouble keeping our tower together because there’s not quite enough friction to prevent sliding. We like the colors very much though, and it works great for a homeschool game we play.",1
Love them. have to turn off when not in use tho,1
"Works good. And doesn't contain anti-freeze, plastics or any other of the dozen or so chemicals found in most off-the-shelf hair goo. Would rather have it fragrance free.",1
Great customer service and ring. Ordered wrong size and replacement was sent without hassle or question.,1
"I tried for a month to break this in... but it just isn't the same ball as the ones that others bring to your gym. It doesn't have the same grip or general feel, and looses air very quickly. Better than your average ball still, but not what I paid for and not worth $50+",0
Bought one about a month ago. Bike works great. Tremendous value compared to what you get at a dealer. Took about 2 hours to assemble and make adjustments. I'm very pleased with the bike.,1
The bottle leaked in the package never got to use it,0
"The first one I got was great. The last one I got was hard as pencil lead and broke just as easily. It went on only with much pressure. The wedge shape made the lines erratic at best. It must have been old, dried up product. It broke twice. There's very little product to begin with.",0
Pros: looks and feels great. Stones are small enough that everyone thinks they are real. Cons: scratches easily,1
"I would have given this 5 stars but the photos are misleading. It shows a little hand held drill, but that was missing from my set. I bought this specific set because I thought it came with the tiny drill. Everything else was there and works well.",0
I’m afraid this body shaper was not for me. Gave me a really weird shape . Not at all comfortable. Will be sending it back.,0
"My fiancé absolutely loves this ring he is a diesel technician who works on tractors all day and he barely even notices that he is wearing a ring, best of all it doesn’t snag or get stuck on anything!!

I would recommend this ring for anyone looking for a comfortable ring at a great price that supports a wonderful cause.",1
I purchased this in February and today for the second time I went to charge the pack and it won’t charge.,0
"This has been a huge hit for my sales team. It’s taken our customer engagement events to another level. It’s built well, sturdy, and easy to use. Super pleased with the purchase.",1
"I purchased this for my son-in-law in January. First mistake! We should have known better to not purchase something that wouldn't be used for several months. He used it for the first time last week and said it was terrible. It was basically no help at all; it was better and faster to do the work manually. I would have loved to return the item but the time frame for a return understandably expired in February. Him and his dad clean a lot of fish, so admittedly they are probably really good at doing it manually. If you are very bad at it, this device could be an improvement for you.",0
"Received this mixer in July. Didn’t use it until now. Big mistake!! It is broken - the mixer makes a loud noise while mixing, and the beaters don’t spin smoothly. My return window is over, and now I have a broken mixer.",0

"This movie took to long to get to the point. A lot of nothing happens for an hour, by that time I was bored.",0
No liquid was in the bottle,0
These are so cute and easy to apply but they haven’t been holding up that well over time (about 2 months now) Would still but again but be gentle with them.,1
I was amazed how good it works. That being said if you forget to put it on you will sweat like you did before. Would recommend to everyone.,1
This item is a true failure. My mistake for not looking further into it before purchase. And regret not making the time to return it. Just picked it from under some papers and shook my head!,0
"Lets start with my first gripe, something simple, something I can get past. They put a giant sticker on the FRONT of the panel. The sheer purpose of this product is to fill an empty space and display the face of the unit. Now the meat-and-potatoes of this train-wreck of a product, two of the four corners are MANGLED, not slightly bent.... MANGLED. I can get past a used item having such wear-and-tear, but it's new, and the rest of the panel is PRISTINE. The box it was shipped in is in perfect shape, it was even wrapped up inside the box to prevent shifting while in transit, which means whoever packaged this clearly saw the damaged product and said ""screw it, it's fine."" I'm honestly beyond curious how the corners get this destroyed and ships this out as ""new"".",0
Item is ok. It makes a sound like a rough metal to plastic contact compare to other massagers that are much quieter. Only a few hrs of use since. Ought... Not sure if it will last long,1

Provides great ideas and practical methods without hundreds of hours of practice. I found the book quite useful.,1

"My brothers and I, all veterans, wanted to replace my dads flagpole for his birthday. I'm not sure what we expected as far as the circumference of light illuminating the flag but I consider this perfect as both of my parents were able to see the flag and have commented on it several times. Just what we wanted. I would ask folks to understand that this light is really for home use and does not illuminate a large area on the ground. As it is mounted on top of the pole the circumference of light is smaller and stronger at the top while larger and weaker on the ground. Thus don't expect your flag and pole to be lit like a government building. If you want that, buy a different commercial grade light.",1
This item is not very strong. Looks very fake.,1
I mostly wanted for closing the gap under my door. Works well what what I got it for,1
"Before purchasing and after receipt, I watched the video which was very helpful for setup. The stand is well made and all went together as per video. I have some difficulty in setting my phone on the stand. Not a case issue … the setting of the lightning cable seems a bit off straight. The support for the phone is adjustable to accommodate for different case thicknesses … it is the slight misalignment of the cable that seems the issue. I have set and reset. Not a deal breaker, just takes a bit of finagling to set the phone. All else works well. The only other ""issue"" is … there are still 3 cables out the back of the unit. Three white cables. I bought a black unit. I'm trying another stand and am on the lookout for a cable wrangler - probably a solvable problem. If nothing else, I can wrap the cables in black electric tape. Honestly, there does not seem to be 1 perfect solution, but what I really like about this stand is how it holds the watch.",1
Book was a mess when I got it. Returned it the next day and was only refunded 1/3 of what I paid!!!!,0
The cords are too short. It stopped working after less than 2 weeks.,0
Very sticky...leaves a white residue on furniture,0
"Nice little case! Vibrant color, room for credit cards and phone!",1
"This is a great item to keep your dog from getting wet. A little hard to connect to your dogs collar without the dog getting a little anxious. The chain to attach to the collar is about 12"" so trying to connect it with the umbrella tapping the dog is a little difficult. However once I attached it my dog walked fine. It definitely kept her dry. My dog is a poodle/terrier and weighs about 15 ibs.",1
"Very pleased with this bed frame, easy set up and beautiful",1
Right size for my yard,1
Way overpriced. It came half way full with only 10 servings. I bought it because all natural but the taste is gross and I don’t really feel anything different than coffee. I’ve already used it so I’m not sure if I can return it or get my money back now. Disappointed as I was looking forward to a pre workout that wasn’t full of chemicals.,0
"I bought this brush to add exfoliating more often in my skin care routine. I love that it's light weight and comfortable to hold. It's easy to switch speeds while in use. Most important to me, since I have really sensitive skin,is that the bristles are really soft but effective. Another plus is it stays charged for a long while (mine does anyway). I will recommend after useing and washing the brush, pat it dry with a clean towel. I noticed the first time I used it I capped it and even with the air vent in the cap it stayed wet, so definitely pat with towel after use. One other thing its comes with the charging cable but you will need a charging port, but heck like lots of people I had an extra so that was easy :)",1
"The towel was a gift for my dear friend who loves it, it works great!!",1
This product arrived late and no return policy.,0
Works as expected and they are very convenient.,1
"I bought 2, do they look like unicorns?",0
I bought this product and thought it was awesome in the box but when I shot it I discovered it jammed frequently and pinches you at the top unless your very careful and after about 10 ft the pellet curves upward severely. After it fell from a barely 2 ft tall coffee table it broke and would not cock Iv also noticed after reading a lot of reviews that this is frequent,0
Can't turn off the unit the fast charger work perfect,1
"I bought this 3 months ago for my 7 year old diabetic son. It’s a perfect size for a kid and also fits me. He’s found it comfortable and hasn’t complained. He wears it everyday to school and all weekend. There’s an intentional hole in the back for pump tubing, which is great. However, the fabric has started tearing where the hole is located. My son doesn’t have a pump, so we haven’t even been putting tubing through the hole. I now need to purchase him a new fanny pack since this one is tearing, and I will not be purchasing this brand again. It’s just too cheaply made.",0
Soft & fits great. Easy to take off & put on.,1
"The product seems to work well but I received one 1/2"" comb and two 1/4"" combs so I do not have the 3/8"" inch comb. Thats a problem because that is the length I always use in the winter; therefor, I am not happy with the product. If the seller would get a 3/8"" comb sent to me that would certainly change my review.",0
Not sure what happened to my steampunk but this is all I got in the bag,0
Absolutely love the quality and look of the dress! Very happy!,1
the packaging was so bad the box fell apart and crushed other smaller packages,0
These bags break and have a terrible perfume smell to them. I only got them because I couldn’t get to Costco. Not worth it.,0
"Great little speaker! The sound was loud and clear. I’ve had others that didn’t sound good when you turned the volume up, no problems with this one. It also paired quickly with my phone. Would definitely recommend.",1
"A well written, fast paced story. I have read the first couple of books in this series. This was one of the better ones.",1
The mic works great once plugged in with a phantom power supply. The part that you insert the arm into the base came off. Seems like it was only held on by glue. So sadly that seems like poor quality.,0
"This table is what I expected. The reason I can't give a five star is due to the legs being uneven, slightly and some of the holes for the bolts are a bit misaligned.",1
My students loved the white board erasers! I didn't realize that they were magnetic but it didn't take the kids long to figure it out! They love them!,1
It was the wrong color,0
Set it and forget it. Only wish it could charge quicker.,1
Nice mirror works well on ezgo mounting brackets will need to be trimmed otherwise they will look ridiculous. I was also only given one thumb screw/knob which sucks but it's not worth the trouble to ship it back over that.,0
made my face a little moisturize but still left little bumps on my face.. i have combination skin,0
Third time I've bought. Perfect,1
Have used with several loads of laundry. Gentle to fabrics and seem gentle to my skin.,1
"Super cute look, great heel size of 2.5"" but wow these ran small and the shoe is so stiff and uncomfortable!! Maybe a larger size would help, but I am not going to risk it, i'm returning the shoes and will try a different brand.",0
They fit and don’t leak. The gauge reads full with a full tank. Have yet to run them down to see how they read when they get lower. Will update the review if necessary.,1
"I'm a novice and bought this as my 2nd paddle; seeing it as an upgrade from my first one. This Titan paddle feels a little heavier than my Ping Pong brand paddle and it looks better. The handle is nicely finished compared to my first paddle that had some rough spots I had to sand down. The rubber on the Titan is sticky and very grippy BUT my starter paddle seems pretty sticky too. In all, the paddle seems to be a good value. Time will tell. Before I move up to a paddle in the $50 - $100 range I will try one out to see if it makes that much difference in my game compared to how I play with the Titan.",1
We return the batteries and never revive a refund,0
"The small 60X and 90X lenses are too small to be of any use, but the large 30X lens and LED work perfect for what I use it for (Examining watches at flea markets before I buy). There is no On/Off switch for the LED as it turns on as soon as you open it, but if you push it back in a tiny amount, it will shut off. For less than $10, it really is a good deal.",1
Great price. Easy to clean. Use them for everything. Good quality. Exactly as pictured. I even throw the covers in the dishwasher and no rust--- very good product.,1
Worked great took swimming in the ocean and it stayed dry.,1
Cute style but...Sizing was completely off. Had to return. They were huge & baggy.,0
The last time I ordered them I fell in love with them. I loved the color of the black! I ordered them again and these ones are in the same bag but the color is different and matched my pearlized blacks that I had and not the pretty black from the last package I had purchased from this site,0
only thing I dont like is it makes a small noise when in use. otherwise its all good.,1
Slightly lightweight but otherwise perfect item. I do wish it had a weighted base cell when you are pulling out toilet paper that stuck can won't wobble around.,1
I have been using this app for a year now and I have been liking it but recently its showing me inappropriate products. I don't know how to get this to stop or contact customer service. may have to delete app for this app for reason. I never searched for any of these items so I don't know why I'm seeing them.,0
Not happy at all. False advertisement. Only plays one song. Does not play fully through. No mint bow. Not at all what is described.,0
This order contains six flat head screw drivers (red handles) and six Phillips head screw drivers (blue handles) of varying sizes for different screws. The handles are made of tough rubber that appears unlikely do go brittle over time as was the case with some I've used. Stanley is known for quality products and these belong in my tool box.,1
Just as described and expected!,1
Love this case everything I was looking for and shipped very fast. Very satisfied.,1
Excellent medical grade equipment and perfect for anyone who needs to lock down there sharps. In a society where we have to deal with worrying about what's going to happen with our disposed of syringes and medications this is absolutely Superior. Was able to lock it down until it was needed to be emptied. At which time I called for someone to dispose of all my stuff and everything was complimented on the quality and craftsmanship of this lockdown box for sharps. Couldn't be happier,1
"Looks, works great, but could use a heavier backing.",1
"I have purchased several of these balloons to the enjoyment of my children. I have only received one bad batch where the balloons looked like they had melted into one another. And the pump broke on the second good balloon. But other than that, loads of fun for your children and the adults that want to use their hot air to entertain them!",1
"Cute, fun, feel good movie. Yep, worth your time.",1
"It doesn’t actually freshen the air, but cute. I was really looking for a car freshener more than an ornament... thought these were adorable but they don’t freshen despite strong fragrance on pads. I’ve had no broken parts like other reviewers and have had them for two months.",0
This fits way to tight. I could barley even get it over my head.,0
"What an amazing product. The keys feel so fresh, the colors are crisp. When you download the software to alter the colors (software is super, super easy to use,) I HIGHLY recommend the Keystroke Wave. It does a ripple affect across the entire keyboard after a keystroke of random and/or specific colors. Love it!",1
"Unless I have a special G8, this has a couple of extra features that don't seem to fit the phone: - extra button cover on the left side, which makes 3 buttons, my G8 has only the volume up/down buttons there - two extra holes on the right side, toward the bottom which expose nothing bu the phone case I guess that's what ""compatible"" means, not perfect fit, but will work fine :-) The main purpose of the case is however achieved: stopping this darn phone from sliding on any surface that is not perfectly horizontal!",1
My daughters eyes lit up with joy when she seen this. She loves it and its well made.,1
Kind cheap but do the job,1
"Inexpensive, it works for my cat.",1
I bought this for my husband. He doesn't seem to have any complaints. It is very sharp!!,1
It’s very bad i buy one it’s not working,0
My husband and I like the blanket. It is a quality product. We have the full size blanket. I am waking up feeling more rested. I wear an activity tracker and have noticed my restful sleep time has increased since I started using it.,1
Part arrived broken. Have not received email response from company regarding replacement (4 days ago). Very disappointed.,0
My most favorite way to carry my camera anywhere I go! Very very comfortable and Compact and lightweight! This is amazing also for the use I'm getting out of this!,1
Movie was a waste of time for me. Thank goodness for fast foward.,0
"Gave to my wife for Christmas. Now that its been 6 months, we find the matts wear quickly.",0
"Value for this product was too good to be true... after using a 2018 15"" MacBook Pro with this, it seems to have overheated and melted. Didn't damage anything else fortunately, and surprisingly didn't blow a fuse, but it was really inconvenient to be quite literally out in the woods on a filming trip with no other way to power my laptop. I'd certainly pay double for a reliable product. I wasn't even using both ports simultaneously, only the USB-C port.",0
"If you are looking to purchase an item from a company that has integrity, please do yourself a favor and stay away. I purchased this item and started the return process within 2 days from receipt. The company claimed that the item was damaged and charged me a little less than $80. The item had only been put together to be broken back down because my dog would not been able to use the item. I would have appreciated, if I had been told the amount went towards animal rescue before being insulted of damaging something and returning it since that is not my character. Do your own full research prior to making a purchase and I am sure you will become knowledgeable through your deep dive in who you are purchasing from. We not only have to be kind to animals but humans as well.",0
"So far, after 7 days of use, I am impressed with this book. The content is well paced and organized. It is well outlined from.the basics to harder subjects. Hopefully I will.pass this exam.",1
Good quality and super cute. Bought a pair for my couch and love them.,1
"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",1
My 2 year old can do all of these cards. They hold up well and we purchased the other sets after buying this one. Great learning tool for young kids!,1
"I paid over $50.00 for this to arrive without the battery pack and a broken zipper! When I asked about the battery pack, I was told ""they would look to see if they had a spare one."" They never followed through. Never would I recommend purchasing from this company!!!! I didn't want to give them even 1 star!",0
My feet are very small and I couldn't get the correct size that I normally buy. Therefore I had to send them back. I was disappointed because I had another pair that fit great and lasted a very long time. I found another brand that is good.,0
"Got in mail to-day. Very quick ship. Arrived with charge in it so that was good. Flashlight works, gives a good spark, nice and noisy, bought it for dogs on my walk. Go on a walk with my new stun gun, and a neighbor down the road was working on his car and forgot to close the gate and his pit bull ran out at me. It was in my pocket and I was not ready, but got it out, sparked it and pitty the pit bull backed off. Of course the owner also called it off, so not really a good test, but dog did look a little perturbed when it was noisily sparking. Taught me a lesson: If dogs in area have it 'ON' and in the hand while walking. In the pocket and turned off cost me time, because I was fumbling to get it out. That dog came quick. The alarm is not ear piecing, it's okay, nothing to write home about. It's well made, the price is right, so I'm very happy with it. Would recommend.",1
NICE PRODUCT FOR THE MONEY,1
"Being from Louisiana myself and having married into a Cajun family I really enjoy these stories. This particular one had laughs in the right places, but the development of Miss Prim and Proper was too simple. A writer herself Miss Prim and Proper should have had more interest in just what the ladies past experiences had been. All in all a good read before sleeping.",1
Did not work at all. Right from box. Will not charge.,0
Great book. Terrible delivery. Came out of the package mangled. Not cool Amazon,0
Great game. Worked fine out of the box,1
"I bought this for my little pug of 13 lbs, but it ripped within her playing with it in after just 1 hour. The stuffing came out and she could no longer play with it until we sewed it back together. Very disappointed",0
Would like to give a zero. Can’t use it on my Nintendo switch,0
"I LOVE these. I had ruined several hats. But, now these absorb the sweat and my valuable event and special course hats will last a lot longer.",1
I canceled this order and reordered using a different mailing address because this was a gift and it came to my address and does not have a packaging slip where I can send it back....disappointed. Also the mailing envelope it came in was torn in two places.,0
Very nice and fresh bold taste of the extra virgin olive oil from amazon itself. It's super in my bruschetta !!!,1
"Came quick, is just as pictured and my daughter loves it. Only thing I do not enjoy is how annoying to alarm tones are. There are several to chose from but they are all very abrasive 90s ringtone-esque. My daughter likes them so I guess thats all that matters.",1
This dress is completely sheer.,0
A stone feel off the second day of use.,0
"I have just recently bought this, I got shocked all these good reviews. It couldn' t provide enough power all the time. I don' t recommend.",0
"This thing is just ok. I've had it barely over a week and only stamped about 5 letters and the ink is already looking kinda tired. There's a little plastic window piece on top of the stamp that shows what the stamp is (i.e. the window snaps shut and holds in a square piece of paper with ""RETURN TO SENDER NOT AT THIS ADDRESS"" written on it so you don't confuse it with other stamps) and that window has already broken off and won't snap back into place. So my verdict is that if you buy this plastic thing that is cheap, you're getting exactly what you should expect: a cheap piece of plastic.",0
Just right size works great.,1
"Still not sure why people are so scared of Pennywise, but I did enjoy the movie. I haven't seen the new one, but I watched this intentionally beforehand so that I could review both. It was entertaining, but SUPER long lol",1
This mouse claims to have an internal receiver. It shows a USB port connector but then when it arrived it had a very small piece of paper with a couple of small words stating the USB receiver was built in but I have tried to use this mouse on numerous computers with no luck. What a joke. Of course because I thought the computer I was using was outdated I didn't try returning it before the 10 days they give to request a refund or any return so I'm out the money and have a useless pink car.,0
these were nothing like their terrific potato chips from my childhood.,0
"The product was well recommended by bush crafting videos on YouTube. But it arrived very dull. I've spent a long time trying to sharpen it, and so far, I haven't been able to put a good sharp edge on it. Very sturdy design, but, not sharp enough even for a steak knife, let alone a survival knife.",0
Haven't used long dog seems to drink more while taking.,0
"The skirt was terrible. It was a rumpled mess. Also, one of the flowers fell off the headband immediately.",0
I placed 2 suits in a garment bag and seam on the side split open. Unfortunately it is now too late to send them back.,0
"This game is okay. However, when I play, instead of swiping up and jumping over trees, apparently, I swipe up and bump into trees. I'm tired of getting the message 'Trees hurt.' or 'Tree Hugger!' It gets annoying after a while, trust me. Ok, fine. THIS GAME IS A NIGHTMARE! JK. It's awesome. (sarcastic)",0
Bought this Feb 2019. Its already wore down and in need of replacement. I dont recommend one purchase this unless its jus for looks.,0
Putting it simple....it tasted like mild taco seasoning....every other Chicken Taco seasoning I've tried has a Southwest or Smoky taste creating a distinct flavor,0
"its like a legit Sanwa replacement part, high quality. Thanks!",1
satisfied with purchase,1
"Did the job, cable is very small gauge",1

"Great puzzle, but has to be assembled perfectly to work. Self made gauges are great. But would like a final view of how the gears should mesh. Mine are slightly out. I will have to guess which ones align and get them to mesh better. This will strictly trial and error as I have no view of the final product.",1
"Too Warm - Expected it to be made out of a material like a bath towel. Very soft, but seems like an old lady would wear this to stay warm inside a building that the A/C is on in the summertime on a 95 degree day...",0
"Had to return it. Didn’t work with my Rx. Tested it once upon arrival, seemed fine. The next day it was leaking.",0
"Other than the buttons/holes are on the female side and it is a bit small for size large, it works.",1
The dress fits perfect! It’s a tad too long but not enough to bother with the hassle of getting it hemmed. The material is extremely comfortable and I love the pockets! I WILL be ordering a couple more in different colors.,1
My little girl loves these books! #3 has been one of our favorites so far!,1
The dragon was missing paint and there was glue or something all over the dragon.,0
Very small!! Too short on my 7 year old.,0
great solution to use your existing key and not have to have a new one cut,1
Shipped wrong tire. Not sure how this can happen when the description is what you’re sending.,0
"I purchased a set of Pioneer Headphones not too long ago, on sale for $80. They did not produce the high fidelity sound I expected, which was disappointing from Pioneer. I was worried that the sound quality was indicative of Bluetooth over the ear headphones, so I returned them. Saw these reviewed as a Beats killer thought I would try them out. I have never used Beats, other than in the big box stores, so I cant really judge that review but these sure did blow the Pioneer set away. Much better bass and all around fidelity. They are smaller, which worried me, but the cups can tilt which allow them to fit nicely. They are comfortably snug and don't make me sweat. Get you some of these, they will not disappoint!",1
"I was skeptical at first but these headphones are pretty good for the price. When I put these headphones in they block out all of the outside noise. Sound quality in my opinion is great. The only complaint I have is the part of the headphones that wrap around your ears are pretty flimsy. But other than that these are really good, and I would definitely recommend these before you decide to spend over a $100 for some beats",1
Waste of money. Bought this item as a gift and I would be to embarrassed to actually give it as a gift. For the price of this item you would think the materials and hardware would be much better. The directions are confusing. The cam lock nuts broke about 50% of the time. I think they were made out of the cheapest materials they could find. We had to go to the hardware store and buy reinforcement pieces because the actual pieces broke. Don't waste your money on this item. This Walmart quality but the price definitely is not.,0
I have not received my order yet!!!!! Please contact me as to where it is!!!!,0
"Wired it up. At first it was fine, then it flickered, and now nothing. ""Not eligible for returns."" :(",0
Very nice. Looks good in my car. It came in fast. The material is good. I'd buy it again.,1
These swaddling blankets are my daughters favorite lightweight and versatile can use as a burp cloth if needed,1
"This is a very cheap made product. Going to check the return policy, hopefully can return free. Would not recommend.",0
"The picture shows the 3rd edition, which is what I was looking for as a gift. I was sent the 5th edition. I look to return the item, and it shows I can’t. Great.",0
this has helped my husbands gums a lot,1
Two Stars because what I received wasn't what you see in the picture!! In the picture theres no nose cover which is what i wanted. Instead i received the kind that cover my nose. Second the velcro doesn't adjust it has only one setting and the velcro is misplaced the harder hooked part should face away from the head not towards it. Theres nothing like a Sleep mask thats two tight and catches your hair because you tried to adjust it.,0
Leaked after 6 months. Great until then...,0
"The holes were off in my stand so that made the basic structure a little lopsided, which I was going to go with for the price that I paid for. THEN, both the back of the stand and the drawer base were too small. I went on to the website to request new ones and just continued to build. THEN, the drawer doesn't fit because the drawer is lopsided and the stand is lopsided. Look, I get it, I paid for a bad quality nightstand, but I couldn't even use or finish building it!!!!!!! Now I have to carry it to a UPS store to return. So disappointed....",0
My daughter went crazy for it,1
I bought this for my son who recently started classes at college. It has been perfect for all the things he needs to access while at school.we have no issues with the adapter and it has been great having additional ports. Love how compact it is and it stores easily in his laptop case. Great product!,1
Perfect fit and very handy.,1
I really like that the water from my dishes drain in to my sink. Even though dishes are on the rack I can still see outside the window! I do not like the fact that I have to pay extra for a silverware tray. It is always needed& should come with the rack!,1
"The only thing I didn't like was the delivery time, It actually took 3 weeks, but the product is great. A great looking product for the cost.",1
It’s look very nice but is very clumsy I don’t know how much protection will give your phone I don’t think much protection but it looks very good,1
The little girl I bought this for was so excited to put it on and loved it! Very nicely made and came with everything you need!,1
"Had mine for a little less than a year, sadly one of the dividers has ripped and been this way for awhile. I like how slim it is! But sad to see it break on me even when not harshly used.",0
Product seems okay. Made from flexible rubberized plastic so hopefully it will withstand my 2 year old. Only issue is I ordered the Lava Red and they look mostly yellow with a slight red tint.,1
"Seal was broke, it was rancid. I ended up ordering the capsules from another seller and they work well.",0
Not only do I love how these products are made and what this company stands for but the products themselves are fantastic! The mask left my face feeling so clean and baby soft! I’m going to purchase a few as stocking stuffers!,1
"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",1
Order was correct and on time. They looked really cute when blown up. Only thing I would say is that the string provided wasn't long enough to fit all the letters on. I had to make shift a second string.,1
Loved the product but it didn ‘t fit the chair and it was returned for refund.,1

"The product looks nice and will do what it's intended for, but it arrived with scratches in the acrylic which make me question how long before it looks like trash. Shelf inserts were a nice touch though.",0
"This is a gift and it looks nice and is packaged well. The only annoying thing is a big sticker that has the price, which is less than the listed price I paid which is even more annoying.",1
"The watch band is great. It fits well, good quality and looks. I plan to buy more in other colors.",1

"This is a great hose, I’m surprised that I haven’t been introduced to this earlier. I love to watch it shrink (the kid in me). I love the idea of having a storage bag for it, makes it easier for putting it away during the winter.",1
"We bought this to use in our RV. We like it very much. Very classy and very sturdy (so far). It is not light weight (ie, like Correlle) but we were not necessarily looking for anything lightweight). However, is is very attractive and so far we have enjoyed using it in our RV.",1
"I bought this headset some point last year as a backup for my main headset, It worked originally upon me testing it. I recently used it and the mic has a ton of interference. If I could return it I would because it's horrible.",0

"- Great quality desk - I would have expected to pay much more for the quality of the powder coating and the finish - Easy to put together - comes with all necessary tools (took 1 hour in total) - Great looking desk - very professional (I got the gray and black) - 60"" Wide surface leaves room for paperwork, etc - Cranks very easily to the fully up position (less than a minute) - Good quality casters allow you to move the desk when needed (also add to total height) - I am 6' tall and the height is perfect (though close to the top of the range)",1

"I find this to look better, be of higher build quality, to have a better fit and to be more affordable than it has a right to, but one thing bugs me: it's difficult for me to push the power button on the iPhone 6S when it's in this case. I can do it, but it takes quite a bit of pressure to make it ""click."" Other than that, I've dropped the phone a couple times and this case has protected it very well. It's really grippy, which I love, and isn't so thick that the phone won't fit in a holster. And I love the super-visible color, which makes it difficult to misplace my phone. I recommend this case.",1
it simply does not work. The Transmitter and the Receiver particularly have to be next to each other in order to work. But that just defeats the whole purpose. I wish I could just return this item,0
"I just got these pens... literally out of the box and 3/4 of them aren't completely filled with ink. One of the blue ones (see photo) has so little ink that it looks completely empty. This was not a cheap set compared to others available, but the colors looked nice and I thought I'd give them a try. At almost $30, I should have just stuck to the cheaper sets. At least it wouldn't have cost me as much to replace them when they ran out of ink.",0
I thought I was buying a regular size tube of toothpaste. Why would I pay $2 for a travel size tube of toothpaste???? I felt like this was false advertising and a waste of money.,0
Love this case! Only gave 4 stars because black was the only color option.,1
I actually didn’t order this for pet use! I’m working on a project for my daughter’s Halloween costume. I’m making her a fox tail and it called for combing yarn with a pet brush and then straightening with a hot iron. This brush is spectacular bc it brings up the tons and tons of yarn remains that would be a headache cleaning up! 2 thumbs up!,1
Grand daughter Loved it.,1
"simple and perfect!! Well packaged, well priced.",1
My daughter loves the new night light.,1
Product works as described. More comfortable than most standard dust masks and the added function of having the organic vapor filter layer is a big plus.,1
Belt loops were not fastened upon opening. They were not stitched.,0
Shame you can't give it 0 stars I ordered this and the package says shipped but I did not receive the package contacted the seller 2 times and still no answer after two weeks very disappointed.,0
Took a chance on a warehouse deal and lost. It said like new minor cosmetic on front turned out to be stickers on front and a broken speaker Connection in the back making Channel 1 useless.,0
The white is the only one that doesn’t break off so easily . They’re all trash though.,0
These lights are OK for a small area to highlight. They are a bit delicate and maybe not as bright as one would expect.,1
"I like these socks for the most part. They are very thick and tall, perfect for winter. I was specifically looking for non-slip socks and they work well. The third picture is comparing the seam inside the sock with one from gerber. The one on the right is the one from Wiggle Toes. It does feel smooth for the most part, but there are bumps at the ends. My baby doesn’t seem to mind it but you might do a trial run if your child is sensitive to seams. The only thing I don’t like is that they slip off easily and think it’s because they are too big. I purchased the size 1-3 which is supposed to be 6-12 months. My baby is 9 months old and they are still a bit big. I will try to update this review when she grows into them and if they still slip off.",1
"Comfortable,light.good for running,walking and off trail. Great price. Not too expensive because I like to change my shoes every 6-8 months",1
This was the end result after not even 2 weeks. The idea and concept is cute but just didn’t work for me: maybe because the paint on my walls? I’m really not sure but these peeled right off the wall and took my paint with it. Btw it will not hold a swiffer mop,0
Fits as expected..really happy with this top,1
"the pen was heavy, it was just a simple rollerball cartridge in pretty casing which was alright, I suppose. What I wasn't happy about was that the pen came chipped and the chipped piece wasn't in the packaging so that I could glue it back on. It was wrapped better than most things I've ordered online so there's no way this was done through shipping and the thing was not delicate. maybe just not checked thoroughly before being wrapped up?",0
Fairly good set. The only issue I have is the seam is really pronounced.,1
Met all expectations except cleaning. Cap can not be disassembled for cleaning. Size and performance was excellent,1
Torch seems to be doing fine for a while. Now the butane continues even after I release and it occasionally doesn't come out in torch form. Spits and sputters the butane out and makes more of a dragon type flame.,0
I like how easy it was to sit up and to use the kids love it know they can play for what that day is forever and not need to change out the battery’s just charge it and keep going and it doesn’t take long to charge either we love this about it.,1
"They fit well in the ear, but don't stay attached to the headphones very well.",0
"Beautifully written and a unique story about a woman/wife who rarely sees her husband, advances herself with an education and meets an English officer who stirs her to give in to a moment of memorable passion. Superb",1
Ordered this for my son. We waited for 3weeks to arrive. The left side where the whole for the garter is torn so we had to tape it. The black paint was erased after a week. This mask is really thin.,0
Red was more of an orange. Inside is cheap. Zipper is good though.,0
"I tried a few LED harnesses and none were bright enough to see my black dog at night running through the woods. This vest, as long as not directly in front of head/tail, is super visable.",1
This Mouse has a very sleek design and comfortable in use. no click sound at all. but since my palm is big hence it is not very convenient to use so long. if mouse design is a little bit big then it will be great. most suitable for women hand.,1
Never received item. Money is gone!,0
You need a red bulb in order for them to flash but only one of the 3 sets I bought has them.,0
"Nice product, good quality which means a good purchase. Thank you.",1
This is a great product design and is perfect for storing your gas. The major flaw is the hand pump. It is made of cheap aluminum and is an absolute piece of garbage. The pump ate itself up on the inside to the point it completely seized up. Ended up finding aluminum shavings in fuel filters on my equipment. Replaced with a better hand pump.,0
They spill when they tip over but other than that they’re great. They’re the same size as advertised and don’t leak when you shake them if you hold down the top.,1
helps me to remember to take my vitamins every day. Kind of wish they had an indicator with M T W Th F S Su or something like that instead of numbers.,1
Bigger than I expect,0
"Even after several hours of charging, mirror failed to turn on light. Eventually after touching the switch (???) several times, it did turn on. And then had to touch it several times again to turn it off. Did not seem to have three light intensities. ""Manual"" (?) 2 1/2 x 3 1/2"" instruction was less than helpful. Only good things to say - design is pretty and it arrived on time.",0
"When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out. THE PHOTO THEY SHOW WHERE THE CARDS ARE STICKING OUT IS INACCURATE.",0
A little big but good quality.,1
Jewels fall off alot. Had jewels off when arriving.,0
Fits on my generator perfectly. Very happy.,1
The chokers themselves were pretty and really shined. But my neck turned green. First time that's ever happened to me. You could even see where the necklace moved around during the day. All green.,0
Did not receive product,0
"What a sweet and fun story. I loved that they were born th normal people. Single parents, living comfortably, adults...Loved it!",1
"There was some question on as to whether or not these were solid stainless steel or not on the listing. Since the seller made a point of saying they were solid, I decided to give it a shot. The bad news: my grill was 1/2"" too wide, so I had to saw off the nubs on the end of the grates to fit. The good news: they are definitely solid stainless as advertised, so I am not worried about these grates de-laminating like my old factory grates. Glad I bought these. They look great, well-constructed and feel heavy duty. Can't wait to fire up the grill!",1
This Seller went WAY out of his way and even thought I sent back my item AND got a refund he sent me one for FREE an it works great as long as you have GOOD USB power or use the lighter plug in. VERY trustworthy Seller... Thank You!!,1
"The price was reasonable except that these sculpting tools were not ready to be used without sanding. They were barley in the shapes showed on Amazon. They are NOT ready to be used for smoothing or even medium fine details. These tools would cause more harm in sculpting than they would aid in artistic creating. I've seen better quality in the simplest children's/beginner tools sets. I may take sandpaper to them some day, but right now they will live in the back of a drawer somewhere in my studio.",0
"It does not tick, but I dropped it off my nightstand and the hands fell off. I took off the face plate to reposition--as the instructions say--but the alarm hand could never be set again. The clock worked for awhile but then it slowed down. I changed the battery--which is hard to find BTW-- and now it is too fast. My $2 Ikea clocks are more reliable. High maintenance. Do not recommend.",0
The light arrived quickly and was well packaged. It was very easy to install and is very sleek looking. It really lights up my dark inside hallway.,1
The copper baking sheet air fryer worked well for me,1
It wouldn’t seal on the outer edge of my iPhone7 so I took it off and threw it away.,0
The chocolate always arrived like it melted and was in clumps....each time I ordered it.,0
That enough for so much money,1
"It does it;s job, it makes ya POOP!!!",1
Love this movie and this is a great blu ray with many extras.,1
Everything about this case was fine other than the fact that I had fo file down the pink hard part near the charging port so it doesn't hurt my finger.,1
"Nice, good quality. But they stretch out and stay stretched",1
I havnt been able to put together product due to no screws plastic locks and wheels,0
The hot glued parts are falling off.,0
Our 6 month old Daughter always needs a security blanket wherever we go. We bought these as backups and they have been so durable and they are really cute too.,1
"The price is great, but the length of time it works until the cable starts to short out is not nearly what I had expected. I ordered this August 18th, got it maybe a few days later. Here I am, September 13th, not even a month later, and I'm struggling to keep a charge going. Constantly having to adjust the angle of the cable and hold it completely still.",0
So sure enough after my 90 day return window this speaker won’t charge anymore. So another defective Bluetooth speaker to add to the mountain of shoddy electronic devices that seem to quit working after a few months. BUYER BEWARE!!,0
They were melted by the time they reached my house.,0
So nice I bought two of them,1
Like everything about it.,1
Grateful bottle was wrapped in plastic as lid was unscrewed and product was leaking out.,0
Just what I need to get telemetry from my Frsky receiver to the F4 flight controller.,1
"I have bought two of these already, the cap keeps breaking. If you don't tighten it down enough it leaks, but you can easily over tighten it and break the cap. I was very careful this time and it still happened. Would like to just but more caps but cant find them separate. Be careful with the cap.",0
This seems to work better than anything else my husband has tried. It keeps everything at 70 degrees with little effort.,1
It wasn’t exactly like the picture and a a stone came off same day I received it but it was a beautiful case so I have already ordered 3 total all at once won’t purchase again though because of that low quality product,0
I got this for Yeti mug as reminder of how much I loved my nursing career. I thought I applied according to directions but the bottom part of the heart peeled up after a few washes. (not in dishwasher) I eventually just removed the whole stethescope. I did enjoy the pattern and color choices of the creation.,1
I'm happy to have replaced our old rack with this one. Works well.,1
Instructions are confusing and poorly written.,0
"I wanted to like this; the material it was made out of was very soft and it was a nice size for what I needed. However, this support is too soft for its own good. What good is a back SUPPORT that just squishes as you lean into it? Unfortunately, this SUPPORT did nothing but squish for me, and I returned it. If you're truly looking for SUPPORT I'd look elsewhere.",0
This smart bulb works great and functions exactly as advertised. It has wide range of colors that you can pick from. Having a light tint color help me concentrate when I'm reading or studying.,1
These patches are easy to apply and stay on. I use them for my freestyle sensor.,1
Not keeping the food warm as expected. It is really just a storage container,0
"If I could give zero stars I would. I decided to try something new. Usually buy the shin bones. Pup is very soft chewer and She managed to break off a piece ball/joint part and started to choke while chewing it. Bones smells so bad. Just threw all of it away. Like this brand, will only buy shin bones.",0
Have 2 large cats and this is the tallest scratching post I have found. Very stable. Scratching surface material seems to hold up better than the rope style. 4 surfaces for scratching.,1
The green monster would not stay inflated! What a bust for my grandkids!!!,0
These did not work at all. The batteries neither came with a charge on them or would take a charge. Terrible product.,0
"i am not happy with this splitter at all, when i plug it in after about a min. it start buzzing. this continues until i unplug it.",0
Came with 2 pens missing from the box.,0
Product was great but the box was smooshed and the bandaids were all over. It’s like they didn’t care when they sent them how they were gonna get to you.,0
"This item has the bases covered; just large enough to hold a small supply of individually wrapped toothpicks, screw top so it won't come loose in your pocket or bag, wood exterior is easier to grip than metal and looks good. Winner.",1
They do what they are supposed to do!,1
Half the keys didn't work and we're lodged so they didn't even depress.,0
"I really liked this water bottle for the first month or so. I was able to get over the fact that you cannot close the straw and leave the bottle in the car or it will drench you. It's been five months and the straw has completely stopped working and if I want to use the bottle I have to unscrew the top and drink from the bottle itself. After about a month, I noticed it slowly starting to break but was able to use anyways but now I must buy another and it will NOT be this one again!",0
"I was very excited to try these only to be let down. They did not stay warm for very long. I will say the little time it is warm it does feel nice and that is why I gave it 2 stars. They are supposed to smell like lavender but they don't. They smell good, but I was really looking forward to the relaxing scent of lavender. Overall just a total waste of money. Not worth the price. Will not purchase again.",0
"The width and the depth were opposite of what it said, so they did not fit my cabinet.",0
"Works well, was great for my Injustice 2 Harley Quinn cosplay",1
Product seems to be working.,1
The blow dryer should be put on the toys section on amazon. This toy was a big joke I had breath hotter than this blow dryer. Do you self a favor and pay extra for a good one.,0
"Look, it MIGHT bump you into ketosis but it tastes like rotten mangos and smells like feet. I don't expect my supplements to taste good. I want them to be effective. I never puked while drinking it, but I did have to plug my nose and down it like my life depended on it. It's that bad. The seller says they are addressing the odor problem through a combination of solutions. I would advise future purchasers to make sure this issue has been resolved before purchasing, and keep in mind the taste is going to be rough...but the price is right and it's effective.",0
My device can't find it/ it's not working. give me my money back. m###er f##k#r ..,0
Failed out of the box.,0
I was pretty disappointed that each packet only makes 3oz of cocoa. It tastes good though so I just add it to my coffee,0
"Broke after a few months sitting there. One day I plugged it in, and nothing lights up anymore.",0
"Easy setup with bluetooth to your phone, and clear instructions provided. This is my second time buying this product, my first one had the USB cable snap off at the Y with almost a year of constant use, could have been my fault due to heavy use. Only complaint is that it is slightly quieter than max volume with a regular aux cord.",1
accurate and easy to use,1
This bulb is more of a turquoise color than blue. The neighbors made fun of it. :(,0
This would be an awesome blender if the lid were made worth a dang. It's a high enough powered little blender but the lid is so cheaply made that I literally have to keep a hand towel near by to hold the lid on with and it still gets saturated. The first time we used it my 3 year old wanted to help and ended up having hot coffee sprayed all over his hands and arms.,0
Filled with lots of great info on how to clean up your liver with ease naturally. Lovely easy recipes to follow as well!,1
"We bought this to do something unusual for a motorcycle lift. We have an electric bed and my wife developed physical constraints that keep her from crawling into bed because the legs of the bed are too high and therefor the bed is too high. So I bought this lift to raise her up about 6 inches and it works great. I have a high torque drill and uses it to rotate the mechanism. It works well! But, one question I plan to write the seller is: Because we are not lifting up some thing that is centered, the lift developed a side to side looseness that I want to fix. I try to get my wife's feet in the center but the leaning load is taking its toll on the lift. If I was lifting a motorcycle I can't say enough good about it.",1
2 stars because up to that point it was an interesting read on his martial arts journey. Otherwise it would have been just one,0
36 dd and 142 pounds I ordered xlarge after reading reviews and checking measurements. It was so baggy ! The quality looked great . Very dissapointed to have to return and wait weeks to reorder when the refund clears Update: received refund and ordered a large still to big the sizing is horribly inaccurate and the zipper is bad quality not going through a second return and waiting to try again,0
Ordered four and one of the four will not work! I am disappointed!,0
"Wasn't sure if this would fit properly on the Libman wet mop that we have, but these worked out really well.",1
Disappointed. Back to carry both my phone and a wallet for me. If all you need is two credit cards then it should be fine for you (I needed 4). More than two are too tight to remove consistently and even worse if you are planning to use wireless charging like I do you will be out of luck if you want to carry more than 2 cards (iPhone and Samsung Wireless Charger combination) as wireless charging stops working the moment you insert the third card in.,0
This is not what it said it was,0
"I got two of these for my headboard for more personalized and direct lighting than my bedside table. I enjoy the different light choices and dimmer feature. But boy was I happy when I needed to do a home repair. I plugged both into my laptop where I played the instructional video and stuck each light turned up full into the cavity of my washer. It was like daylight and the slim design allowed me to place the lights just where they were needed and get full illumination. When I first started working under my washer I was using my cell phone for light! If I had a flashlight at the time it would have been too heavy and awkward, these lights are very lightweight.",1
These feel nice after a long day. Warm them up in the oven for a bit and instant relaxation.,1
"Works perfect for my PS4 slim and controllers. It doesn’t come with instructions but simple enough, it’s stickers.",1
"This is a WELL TOLD Romance that spans an ocean from England to America. Lots of description of the places you will visit as you read. Well developed characters, I especially like the characters of the Duke of Bancroft, Amelia, Anna, Jake and Jonathan. Nice surprises at the ending, and a clean read. Highly recommend this as all of her books have unique story lines.",1
"The fit doesn’t quite work well with Phillips light strips, and the tabs tend to bend sideways when clamping the closure shut, which shorts out the color circuits and prevents you from being able to change colors to anything from white. The tabs have plastic retaining bits which prevent you from sliding the strip in because of the solder, so you have to bend the strip to get them to fit or try to clip out the plastic. I had better results just soldering the connectors to the strip itself. Definitely not worth the asking price.",0
Hands down my favorite no show socks. I immediately bought another set as soon as I tried them on and walked around in them. I love them!,1
"If some of these reviewers are looking for great literature: Learn Greek. I read this novel when it first came out in paperback in the early sixties. It has held up to the test of time as far as a novel goes. The sex and violence is not as new nor shocking as it was in those days. I think we have all become a bit jaded. Characters are well written, a novel to enjoy reading just for the sake of reading. A book that keeps your attention and moves right along.",1
The pole is just so so and a bit weak at the joints but still very fun to play with for the price,1
"Instead of a black one I got a white one, but at least i could return it.",0
"I purchased this to temporarily replace the Bluetooth function, which recently failed, on my 2015 Nissan Altima and it has been absolutely AWESOME. This is a great temporary fix until I decide on how I want to proceed with repairing the Bluetooth function through the actual radio. I HIGHLY recommend this product.",1
"This ink, as far as black and white tattooing goes is the most amazing and smoothest ink I have ever used, it's very dependable and has never let me down",1
Very low quality materials and construction.,0
In the picture it looks shorter than it is. It’s not a crop top!,1
I like the size and the grey color. It is a replacement for an old stool just like this that was just too trashed looking to keep in my new laundry room :),1
unless i am using it wrong it is not magnetic,0
No tracks- means it will be hard to make a straight cut. No blade adjustment -means you cant adjust the deepness of your cut.,0
They are a little long but otherwise fit well and are comfortable,1
My granddaughter loves bath bombs and these were no different. Packaged very well. All of the roses make a circle with a heart saying love in the middle .they fizz in the tub awhile which I like and the smell is very good left her skin feelin soft. A little expensive but most bath bombs are. They were comparable to the bath bombs I have bought at a pricey boutique all in all I was satisfied,1
DO NOT BUY! Device did not work after the first use and the company is ignoring my return request. You want the device to be reliable when you need it. I no longer trust this brand.,0
I don't like anything about it and I don't like that it is not able to be returned. JUNK!,0
"Good quality and soft. They do shed a bit, but I imagine any others would too. I would buy again.",1
"Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder.",0
"game really let me down, game was extremely sub par, did not follow first game at all. i was a fan of the first one but i hate that i wasted my money on the second one.",0
I bought this and used it and had only 2 flushes. I don't know what happened. It lost it's potency.,0
Arrived for the second time broken.,0
Will use at night. Really like the unit but sound control is to touchy,1
This is piece of shit!!! Do not waste your money for this!!!,0
I like the thin profile of these cutting boards.,1
Works great once I figured out how to configure my new TV to switch to optical audio out.,1
I received my bluetooth headset and it was used for listening to music only and occasional phone calls.sound quality is great and its comfortable to use.i used it's all day battery life is about 8 to 10 hours.it takes 1.5 hours to charge. It came in a small case with extra ear pieces and cushions. Good buy.,1
"This is a great gift for any kid that is a plane enthusiast. It was really easy to put together, but one down fall is that the tail piece doesn't seem to snap in very well, so it can be pulled off rather easy. The other wings seems to snap in tight and there are no issues with those. The lights are really bright, and the speaker is loud enough, but not too loud. It doesn't seem to work on carpet very well, but works great on wood floors or outside in the driveway. Over all great gift, it would be a 5 star if the tail piece didn't off so easily.",1
Smells astringent. One bottle arrive cracked and leaking.,0
Seriously sad to think this could be the last I read of the Almighty Ford and his buddy Mike. Fantastic work. You won’t be disappointed.,1
"We no longer have any landline phones but do have a landline for another purpose which requires occasional troubleshooting. This somewhat barebones device allows for us to test for a dial tone and make and receive a test call, exactly what we needed it for.",1
"This product is much smaller than anticipated. It ships directly from China, so it take quite some time to get here.",0
"Bought this after I gave birth to lighten the line of my tummy. Didn't do anything but exfoliate the skin... although, the line did gas over time without the cream",0
did not keep food warm for work. Disappointed and too busy to send back take as a loss.,0
Love the case for my Amazon Fire 7. Makes my Fire easier to use as well as protects it.,1
"This set is fantastic! Very good scissors. Love the curved ones. Managed to groom my wriggly pup (with the aid of hot dogs) really great set. I am really pleased & happy, pup is cooler.",1
"Pics are smaller than the original Polaroid cameras from 30 years ago, pics come out slower and quality is about same.",1
They look nice. But these are not completely stainless. I haven’t even installed mine yet and there is already surface rust on the welded joints.,0
Only used for a week,0
"I loved the taste, didn't like that if I had wanted to reorder it was on a two week wait, even as a prime member. I also didnt like the huge price increase! This price has almost doubled since we first purchased it! We wont be reordering, and we're disappointed because we love this stuff!",0
Bought the whole line. Love it!,1
"Loved the color, price and fast shipping. I have only worn them in the yard and around the house to see if they would rub. They have not.",1
"It definitely produces ozone. We have it in a bathroom where the cat box is, and that is the only reason we got it: to deal with those odors, which it does easily. It produces far more that needed for that job. Which would be OK, I figure the excess will get pulled out by the central vent system that is in a nearby hallway, and be spread through the rest of the house and possibly give some benefits. But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more.",1
Very creamy and moisturizing but not oily. It works like a primer and gives smooth texture which makes it easy to apply foundation!!,1
Ran entirely too small,0
"Cute shirt fit as expected, doesn't feel like a cheap shirt",1
Carry-on is Perfect for any travel.very light to carry,1
"Scissors are great, pretty nicely built. Only drawback is the magnet thing doesn't hold anything heavy. Barely holds the shears.",1
"Great read, also very informative about the game of football. Liked TO but really loved Poppy and her extraordinary group of friends. Guessing Maxwell and Brynn are up next, can't wait to read!!!",1
"What I received with this product was a fancy bottle of BROWN WATER that had a extremely slight scent of vanilla and NO VANILLA TASTE! It tastes like plain water. I tried working with the company as well as Amazon and the company REFUSED to allow a return of this disgraceful excuse for vanilla extract. I would not recommend Blue Cattle Truck in the future for any product. This is absolutely ridiculous that a company would not stand behind its product. So, now I have a $36 bottle of brown water to stand on a shelf and remind me that I was taken advantage of. I would rate the product a ""0"" but it won't allow anything less than one. Thanks a lot, Blue Cattle Truck.",0
Stopped cooking the eggs properly after,0
2 stars because overall purchase was good. I think the YETI cooler is overpriced and overrated !,0
"I've bought a few different types of wrap-around LED lights in the past couple of years. I thought this design was one of the better ones. The way the plastic lens mounts into the light is clever and it is easy to remove and re-mount. In a garage or a shop with a high ceiling, these lights would cover a big footprint with nice, intense light. In my basement application, where the ceiling is low and the joists collimate the light, more fixtures are needed than I originally imagined, but it's still pretty affordable.",1
"An odor still lingers from shipping...kinda musty odor.... hopefully will fade. Otherwise product is sturdy and suits my needs for extra seating, foot prop and eventually Afghan storage",1
I love the material of these gloves and that I can also use my phone with them on. Have already worn them a few times and love them!,1
Exactly what I was looking for.,1
They pulled me into the story. But would have liked a little background information on the way the whole school and cities came to be.,1
"I tested it in the sea an in a pool, it works well, get a bit of sand, but its easy to clean",1
When I opened the bag the product smelled of chemical. Which isn't very surprising. Thought I just may have to wash it. I held it up and the fabric was awful. Itchy feeling and very heavy. I tried it on anyway once again I thought after wash this may change. Well it felt heavy on and it has no shape. This is not breathable fabric at all. So I did not wash it repackaged it and sent it back. I bought it to hang around the water park or beach with the kids as a cover up. Nope,0
I didn't get all my screws,0
"If you are supposed to squirt this in your toilet bowl and let it sit for ""however"" many minutes, it is a huge disappointment. It is so thick that it will run down but not spread, and you must use a brush to spread it. That incorporates water from the toilet bowl itself and undoes the idea of letting it sit on the surface. I much prefer sprays that actually will cover all the area in the toilet bowl, under the rim, etc. I will not buy this again.",0
"I wanted to switch from supermarket ""natural"" kibble to 100% organic, but my cat hates this stuff. It costed a lot, so I'm very disappointed.",0
"Cheaply made. The bottoms fit way better than the top. If your big busted, go for a more expensive quality made swimsuit with ample support. If you are a A, B, maybe a C Cup woman you can pull this look off easy.",0
I am extremely satisfied with the flair pens I ordered. Shipping was very prompt and the product arrived in excellent condition. The colors are very vivid and the tips are durable. Thank you for a great product!,1
"Nice case, huge capacity. Could use more micro item configurations/pockets. Would be nice if it had the rubber bumpers on bottom for when its resting on ground and to help stabilize. Otherwise very nice",1
"I like the fact that I received this merchandize as promise but when I open the box I was dissappointed to see how small the coffee mug was. I was expecting to see a bigger size for the price of $13.99 that I pay, that’s why I gave 4 star.",1
"Dulled severely after a single use, caused the drill to buck and nearly took my father’s finger off. Tried it again several more times, and it caught and kicked every time. You get what you pay for.",0
"I have ordered this many times and the product I received this time was completely different. The color is way off (yellow/cream versus medium/light brown). This time it is greasy and difficult to wash off. Plus, the exfoliating beads are large. Guessing I received a fake product!",0
"It leaked in the envelope it came in and was almost empty, when I opened It. Which I had read on other reviews, but I thought I'd give it a shot.",0
When you have a refrigerator that filters the water for you you need to be sure the filters are replaced in a timely way. Kenmore made the original filter so you have to stick with what you know is a good product and does the job.,1
"Not bad, but very often you need to play with brightness, contrast and saturation of original picture, otherwise you will get either too bright or too dark print (depends on original pic). But I still like it and would recommend.",1
The phone case is very popular and the color is very beautiful. It feels good.,1
I’m very disappointed. The bottle is cute but it stopped working after one week. It no longer sprays out water.,0
"Product advertised to be compatible with larger TVs, that is not the case. The stand is too small for even the largest adjustment, should not be advertised to support larger TVs. And I apparently only had a small window to return the item and I’m stuck with something that did not work.",0
He was a strong dragon king and he had come with two of his brothers mates to find out who the drain was that stole their memories and program their minds to kill each other. When they find someone inside and try to get her to help them it causes trouble for her also and he has to protector he’s pulled to her and doesn’t understand why but has an idea that she might be his mate. Now just to prove to her that dragons do exist they mate for a lifetime and she was meant to be his. And fight the bad guys while he’s doing it,1
"I was excited to replace my iPad cover with this one as it says in the description that it has ""Ultra strong built-in magnets holds the folded front cover panels firmly to stand the iPad Air 2 and let you enjoy iPad Air 2 without holding it""... well, in my humble opinion there is zero magnetic hold when trying to fold the cover into a stand... once I set it down, it stands up fine... but as soon as I pick it back up the cover unfolds with no-resistance. Otherwise quality seems good.",0
It takes at least two people to put it up. I had to get out plastic washers and wood screws to put it up on my wooden fence.,1
"Bought it, worked for couple weeks then didn’t. Exchanged it. Worked for a month then didn’t. Bought a pack of batteries but nothing is vibrating now and dog still barks. It’s a 0% chance of it working for very long. Can’t return now.",0
I love this product. I use it for restless leg syndrome and it works for me. I also use it for black and blue bruises.,1
Super cute but there isn’t enough slack to adjust for me to be able to get the harness on my cats. It looks like in other photos there is much more room to adjust the tightness of the harness but mine was much shorter and i could not see how they were supposed to get in.,0
This product came quickly and set up easily but somehow the main door is slightly bent where the second latch is. Needed the pen so not returning it just a little disappointed in the quality. Especially because it was in the box and sealed when I got it.,0
"Zippers are horrible. The bags were ok. The pouches zippers are better but I am treating them with extra TLC. I threw out the packing bags right in the hotel. The zippers were off the track right upon delivery. I fixed them but they do not zip smoothly. Too much trouble. Very annoying because when you’re in the road for six weeks, you want to be organized.",0
2 stars only because they were very comfortable. They only lasted 3 weeks in the steel mill I work in before the soles were completely melted.,0
Work pretty well. Quite bright and compatible with most transformers. They are quite small so can be hidden if you wanted.,1
What is this and the cost?,0
Ordered these for a friend and he loved them!,1
"Great water bottle, wish it was slightly larger just so I didn't have to refill as frequently. Works like a charm, you set up the alarms so it notifies you to drink. Once it goes off, you can simply open the lid and drink and the alarm will cease. Well made product, good quality and bpa free.",1
"I bought these for driving; they are ok for that. They don't change very dark in the sun and they stay gray inside, so they can't be depended on to transition. One of the nose pieces broke off, so I ordered a second pair. I have the same issue with the frame. The quality is poor. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for.",0
"these are great for the price but not sure how long they will last. they seem more cheaply made than store brand, but it is nice that you get 2 for the price of one",1
"I bought two sets of these to fill six empty ear piercings. Overall, I’m happy. They are very pretty, and they match my more expensive white opal jewelry. Packaging: each set comes in its own small plastic bag sealed with an adhesive strip. There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn’t get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can’t see behind my ear of course. I’ve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased. I have very sensitive skin, and I’ve experienced no irritation. The balls have not loosened, and the jewels still fit securely in their settings. I originally wanted to get real white gold jewelry, but I’m not sure I’ll need to anytime soon.",1
So overall I like this flag. The colors are bright and the material feels good for the price. Not cheap but I definitely wouldn't keep this outside in bad weather. The one bad this about this is my flag smelled awful when it came out of the package. I bought another flag with this one and they both have this weird chemical smell. It's give me a headache and they haven't even been up 30 minutes. I sprayed them down with odor neutralizer and it helped for a few minutes. Definitely try to air out your flags before you put them in a room or anything,1
"No spoilers intended, but some ideas must be presented to explain my rating. I read the collected edition knowing full well the outcome of the series, and I just can’t help wondering if this was even a story that needed telling. Superheroes are supposed to be better than us. Does it help to see so many of them broken? Even worse, what good does it do to break a representation of hope? I’d would have rather had a story rebuilding the DCU rather than destroying it.",0
I have a 2005 Lexus RX330 and it did not fit right. I had to remove the back of the battery pack for it to fit and I had to sand down the inside where the key goes because it wouldn’t shut. I made it work but I won’t be buying this one again,0
"This is a little confusing at first, but once you get it all set up, it's great. Only thing that I would recommend to extend battery life would be to get rid of display on the wireless sensors. Other than that, exactly what I was looking for.",1
"After calibrating this extended battery via full 2 cycle discharge and charge I can confidently say it was a great buy. This has fixed one of the few flaws in my v20, now I can comfortably go 2 full days without charging with moderate use with almost 7 hours screen time, while still maintaining fast charging. There are some minor short comings. The case does not offer much in protection as others have mentioned, the bump surrounding the screen is quite small. Also the screen protector will protect at minor scratches at best but not from drop damage as its not a full glass version. The front camera is also exposed. There is the issue with having to remove the case to fully insert the charger. So I'm taking off a star for that. Still highly recommended would buy again.",1
"Previous batch received in September 2019 of the same flavor (toasted onion & garlic) was very delicious. This batch received in October does not taste good and I keep getting acid when I try it. The date on it is for November 2020, the bag looked fine (sealed, no issues) and I've tried it a few times on different days. It's definitely the pumpkin seeds, not me. This brand is the first I've found with whole roasted pumpkin seeds that are not made mostly of salt, and I've been pleased to discover them. Not so pleased if this is a sample of their quality control.",0
"feels very solid.Live in a very windy area, still hasn’t blown off the balcony.",1
"Got computer today. i7, 32g ram 1t ssd... Very nice. Very fast. It feels solid though maybe a bit heavier than I thought it would be. Powered up and connected to internet quickly. Installed chrome browser and chrome would hang after a reboot until I guess McAfee did it's scanning... Uninstalled McAfee and then that went away. Other than that this is a great machine... I will revise this review after I get a bit more time with it!",1
I just didn't like the construction,0
Repair looks like crap and they will not take returns! Stay away and don't waste your money here.,0
Thought I would love these but the nose spring piece has already broken off. I am vey disappointed. Have not used them that much.,0
"These are so cool, but they are extremely fragile. It's impractical to actually use them, as they chipped immediately - I can't imagine them lasting beyond any meaningful curiosity or experimentation.",0
Broke after a month.,0
The armband quality is pretty good. It is tight enough when I run. I had one before which was loose if I moved a lot.,1
Sizing runs really small. Order a size or two up. Also really poor quality. Not worth your money.,0
"Received this package - everything was in it except one package of cups, I only received 12 instead of 24. Not sure how to contact amazon to get this fixed...?",0
"The pencil feels good in the hand however when I write I feel a clicking between the red plastic ring and the metal, I am not that heavy-handed because I write daily with an extra fine point gold tip fountain pen. I was expecting more for the price, maybe I received a fake, not worth my time to research. I would not recommend this to anyone due to my experience.",0
"I love the way Liv and Cole just naturally go together. She is high society and he likes to fly under the radar, so they balance each other out. This is a fantastic series that I just reread in its entirety. You won't be disappointed.",1
"First it claims that it has 8 hour battery life. Which it doesn’t. Has never gone longer then 2 1/2 of a hour. Not even that, it does not have any type of noise canceling. Good at phone calls but my main problem with it is that the right one always turns off and both of them are never on at the same time. When they are there on & off. Also the second day they just started making loud noises that wasn’t coming from my phone I have no idea what it was. Save you’re money buy real good quality earbuds these are no good",0
I bought this specifically as the product description says it has a board short connector. It does NOT. Very disappointing. Now have to deal with returning it.,0
"Two problems, first of all, the mounting holes for the speaker grilles DO NOT line up with the speaker mounting holes into the box. Second problem, how do you mount the crossover network??? There are No holes in the housing to mount it. They should have included a tube of silicone glue with the speakers to glue the grilles to the speaker box and glue the crossover network to the speaker box",0
I ordered this because of the gold rose BUT when i finally got it oh surprise it looks like an ugly gold color. Extremely disappointed,0
"I use this bag to carry several Dewalt tools. Unlike costlier bags with multiple pockets, this bag has only one, which is exactly what I needed. Large, sturdy, heavy duty zipper... it's a great bag.",1
I bought 4 and NONE of them worked. Yes I used new batteries!,0
It is very helpful to prevent slipping for my high heels which does not have good protection. I will repeat the order for my all shoes.,1
"Super fast shipping. Easy to follow instructions. I barely got it growing and my cat was on it like white on rice. Only Gave it 4 stars because it didnt have quite enough potting soil in the container, i had to use a couple tablespoons to cover all the seeds. They send plenty of seeds. It grows super fast, but I may need to keep my cat away from it for a few days, because she chews it down to the nubs, and it needs to regrow.",1
I really like the product but the wrong color was delivered. I got a green one and ordered the rose gold.,1
It went on ok but tube dried out fast,0
"Still waiting for results it hasn’t been 6 weeks yet, but will order more",1
"The hose is GREAT, BUT, it took 20-30 mins to untangle it.",1
"The bible contains pictures, which depict Christ. The illustrations are well done, but give the bible a cartoon feel. My young reader wanted a more grown up bible. There are many, many sections of pictures which neither of us liked. Also, the pages are not bound well.",0
"While the presentation is very nice, these lashes are impossible to get on. The lashes are not curved enough to allow them to lay on your natural lash line so that the second/ under lash can connect with the attached magnets",0
"So, i am pretty sure this would be an awesome tool, if you have skip tooth chains or semi skip tooth chains. But i was trying to use it on a full complement chain (tooth, drive, tooth) and it doesn't not lay flat in and grind the rakes. Had to send it back, back to hand files.",0
Fit as expected to replace broken cover,1
I am very pleased with this product. Exactly what we wanted for our dog. Very happy with our purchase,1
Pieces were coming off it,0
Cute but feather are much smaller than pictured.,1
The dish is cute but has a blue stain on the bottom right corner that won’t rub off. Disappointing.,0
Solid value for the money. I’ve yet to have a problem with the first pair I bought. Buying a second for my second box.,1
"This novel is reminiscent of the old Victorian style romances, with some unsettling twists and a great tale of self discovery.",1
Not working it's on but sucks nothing outta the air I don't understand why it's so loud when running it's a nightlight now I guess,0
They seem fine so far,1
Nice body scrub puff. Its thick and lush.,1
"Love, love, love this! Made cutting my diamonds and triangles a breeze and corners were sharp and precise!",1
"Exactly what I needed for my workouts. I know they are marketed for pullups, however I use bands frequently in my training for speed based barbell exercises and these bands work perfectly. Recommend!",1
Smears really easily but great brush size,1
Not worth your time. PASS.,0
The kit comes with the wrong tool to swap the lens. The T4 tool is too big to take off the screws to replace the lenses. Be careful not to strip the screws while attempting to swap lenses. Luckily my lenses were already a little loose so I was able to replace them. Other than that the lenses seem to be of decent quality. They seem just as dark as the original lenses.,0
I needed last minute stockings and mantel holders. Both worked out great. Came with a set of 4 different hooks. Sturdy and worth the money!,1
Does not work to well on plastic totes kind of disappointing,0
At first they were very nice but the almost the entire license plates have rusted out.,0
Broke the first week. Do not buy!!!,0
It's a mat for working out that works as it should. Makes my workouts on my hardwood floors much easier.,1
Band is way too short! My sister lost it within a week since it kept falling off. So disappointed.,0
The case has great protection however it turns yellow after a few months of use.,0
"I like them. They just don't have a great range of distance. And sometimes tilting my head or just moving around, when reaching for stuff the sound goes in and out. I like how they sit around my neck without falling. Actually pretty comfortable. Be careful if you wear a pull over hoodie. I have thought I lost them just to find them inside the hoodie. For the price they are good.",1
"Great price for this type of watch band. Fairly thin, but works as expected with a good magnetic closure.",1
Too thick and big. Unattractive.,0
The adapter is easy to setup and the ability to connect to 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz is great. My Wireless router has no problem connecting to the 5 GHz.,1
"They were very comfortable but my toes touched the top on the right shoe and since my left foot is a little smaller, it slipped quite a lot, just too big.",1
I like the fact that it provided decent padding but the downside is it kept slipping out of place. Although it has a drawstring and elastic the straps every time I sat in it it would slide to the side. That could definitely lead to a fall.,0
The description said 10 pound bag. There is no way this is 10 pounds. I get the 5 pound bags at the feed store and the 5 pound bag is bigger and heavier. I ordered two bags and I can lift both bags with one hand without trying.,0
"description incorrect, only received one book. Cheap packaging, wrapped with some sort of brown paper.",0
Makes life so much easier having a garbage right at your fingertips while you're cooking by the sink,1
"I love it and waterproof too, this cant get any better and thank you for the gift you left me inside the backpack. Amazing, thanks!",1
Guess i picked the wrong flavor. Sunflower seed is disgusting. I’ll be tossing them after eating a few out one bag.,0
"Are fine, just a bit big for a small thin person who is me.",1
I have never received coffee from Amazon that was punctured and there’s no support for this product!,0
I carry a bunch of stuff some related to an injury and a rather extensive first aid stuff so I need a lot of pockets. Got tired of caring a big back pack or bag. My first pocket vest is about to give up the ghost so I needed new one. Only thing I did was add snaps to some of the pockets to make sure they didn't open up by mistake. I also add stuff to it when I go camping. Revision. It's not cotton. The design is great but the implementation stinks. Had to make repairs on it due to crappie sewn seems. Not enough fabric at the stitches and they used crappie thread. I'm on my 6th or 7th repair and have not used it that much so far. Stitching is coming lose way to often. Junk.,0
