This is a neat toy. It is fun to play with. The track pieces snap together easily. It keeps kids entertained. It comes with dinosaurs. It is made very well.,1
"It came right on time, looks fantastic. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price a little to high but it supposed to be handmade so it balances it off.",1
This is great! My 8 month old thinks he can walk already but doesn't have the best balance. This gives him the support he needs so he can move with more stability. He doesn't always love wearing it because he likes us to hold his hands. But I think this will help him get more comfortable and start walking really soon,1
"I wish there was a way to make this no stars. I took our 12.5 lb Aussie Doodle puppy, 4 months old, for her first walk on this new leash. WOW! She is teething badly, but I didn't think anything of it. Her previous nylon leash lasted for two months before I wanted to order a new one for her. We got two blocks down from the house and low and behold, she had this thing to almost ripped in apart and she would have taken off!! I had to pick her up and carry her back home! Terrible leash but Amazon was quick as usual to offer a full refund. I am going with a totally different brand and style.",0
I like how the case looks I really do but it is already coming apart I have had it for 1 day and it is making my Face ID not work. The looks of the case can not get it more then 2 stars.,0
These are freaking adorable! I hung pictures from them. I had these rated a 5 star when i first got them up until I’ve had them for two days and the lights went out. Changed the batteries & still won’t work. All the clips worked fine & it was cute. But the whole point was to have a suttle light & they stopped working. Return started.,0
"optical zoom is great, but the algorithm used to provide focus correction actually fuzzes up the picture. This is written about in the reviews and is annoying at 40x optical zoom.",1
"It tears off your hair and it hurts, but you can see nasty stuff on the mask after. Make sure to moisturize before you put on and after because it does dry your skin out, and make sure to have something to close your pores because you’ll break out if you don’t",1
"My guests loved the personalized keychain, it came with the bags which made them very presentable. The keychain is functional being a bottle opener too.",1
I highly recommend this product. I ordered these for my grandchildren to share a bit of the UK. Our uncle would send them to us every year and I wanted to share the wonderful memory. They arrived on time and in perfect condition. I'm a bit partial but I think Cadbury is the very best in quality and flavour.,1
"My kids all have their own laundry hampers. My daughters broke and so I got this one, I like that it is slim and fits in a small place. It's not huge but I didn't want huge because that means I let the laundry build longer. Great hamper!",1
I was informed it arrived I got all the other items but not this the hoverboard case was the only thing missing,0
Loved the book and how quick of a read it is,1
Following thier sizing instructions and they don't come close to fitting properly.,0
"By the time I got to this dress and tried it on, I was fed up with ordering on line.",0
This item got all torn up after only 6 months. Wrote to the company to see if they would do something to possibly return or refund and never heard any response.Waited to even write this review giving them an opportunity. Even for 50.00 I feel like the purse should of held up better than this. Stitching comes out very easy and IS NOT something I would trust with my gun. BE AWARE,0
The brush is small yet solid and does a bang-up job on removing embedded hair on brushes. Will purchase for others as gifts - thank you!,1
Very soft & easy to use. My belly isn't very large yet & this sits more on the lower stomach than under it. I think this product would be best when you're further along & your stomach is larger.,1
Doesn't do a good job measuring smaller increments.,0
I love the idea and how easy they were to use But one the clip broke with in hours of using it I was able to replace the hook with one I bought at the store,0
I miss their old design. Too hard to get my little one into this. Notice that the shoulder strap attaches to the door. I need to have the bag on my shoulder to get my dog in properly. So disappointed. Found older version on EBay and bought 3 of them!,0
Very tight fit in the fingers. Hand fit is good. Never have had to wear a workout glove larger than a large.,0
Very nice to store bills,1
I've had this case for just 6 months and the case cracked and then broke.,0
"Bought this item for my 5 yr old son and he loves it, makes him feel like a big boy. Makes homework time go by a lot quicker since all his supplies are in one place.",1
Quality of the sunglasses don’t match up with the price. The lens looks flimsy and the frame is uneven.,0
I use this for bedtime. It helps everyone sleep better.,1
"It didn’t last one winter. It tore, and was brittle by spring.",0
"The Marino Avenue brand Men’s low cut socks are of good quality. I put them through one cycle of hot water washing and drying and they stood up to the challenge. What I like best is the color choices on the socks. The green, yellow, red, and black one is my favorite combo.",1
"Thank you, we are very happy with the item. Looks and feels great. Very easy to maintain. Highly recommended",1
Super warm and stylish hat but runs large on me. Well made and washed well without fading or losing its shape.,1
"Product works as advertised. I've only used it to hold a sponge, and it works perfectly for that application",1
"Personally, I couldn’t get past the scent of this. I don’t know wtf it’s supposed to be, but it smells just awful walking around and having it in my nostrils all day. No thanks!",0
Everything was as stated. Recommend for anyone who needs more bands for there Apple Watch.,1
So the set up was a nightmare took hrs to set up. Can only be done on your phone. What helped me was turing off my cell data. Haven’t tried the music or any special features yet. Really just need it to check on the kids. Would recommend if your willing to save money for a decent product with a lot of work to set up.,1
I needed this book in my life.,1
"Great value, will purchase again in future",1
Lights constantly flicker,0
"In the Q&A section it states ""glass"" but it is plastic. Works fine, but I do not like getting misled, so I returned it.",0
Looking forward to the next volume in this series.,1
Great fit... very warm.. very comfortable,1
These need time to recover from shipping...like a few hours to adjust to your room and show similar readings. There were pretty accurate compared to other thermostats and thermometers but I wouldn’t bet my life on the accuracy. If you need lab quality you’ll probably have to spend more than a couple dollars but for most projects these should be fine.,1
It not like the picture very disappointed ☹️,0
"It Cuts extremely well. I'll give it a 5. The blade turned on the edge brownish, but I worked on it & it's okay still cuts. Good for the money for simple cuts. My observation. Adult supervision extremely advised.",1
A bit too detailed for me but interesting enough theories about how things could be to keep me going. This is a case of saving the human race against overwhelming odds.,1
Uneven sticker. The yellow plastic is peeling off the blue portion of the HRC logo.,0
It arrived in bad condition! It was bent in many places. Very unhappy,0
"Not flattering at all. Loved the print and the material was nice and thick. Good quality but the cut of the dress is not good. It doesn't hang all cute like the pic, but more like a think, stiffer flannel.",0
Decent compression sock but the sizing is not quite as advertised. Try ordering a size down.,0
I went from unable to use a mouse that lost it's dongle to able to use it very quickly.,1
"Too stiff, barely zips, and is very bulky",0
Bought as a gift for the wife. She liked it and uses it all the time.,1
Great bike but the wheels are plastic. It works fine with my 4 yrs old son.,1
Horrible quality . So give to this over stuff cheap quality pillow and over priced. The idea of “ one size fits all” is clearly their mentality,0
One pair of socks get ripped on the heel after second wearing,0
"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",1
"This lamp looks and feels very cheap however for $10 it does the job. Item did not come with remote (box has picture of lamp with remote) and the motion sensor does not work. I chose this item because it said Amazons Choice, however it was not what I was expecting!",0
"i like this kettle so much because of it's bright red , stand out in the kitchen , bring out some enthusiasm to the life,and it has nice quality and better price!",1
Broke easily. Very poor quality.,0
Provides good amount of steam. Super quiet.,1
Just not necessary. I know. I know. Everybody's doing it. I resold mine after temporarily losing my mind and buying into the hype. I realized my pots & pans work just fine. I'm not so important I need to free up even more of my time. I can accomplish many things while browning then slow-cooking a roast. And it tastes better from the oven anyhow.,0
Liked the router until I tried to setup the flash drive as storage location for creating online storage. It caused the router to lose its mind. Sent it back!,0
"Have not used the item yet, but price great and worth trying. Delivery is what is so great! Ordered one night and arrived the next evening! Fantastic!",1
"Lasted 14 Months then died. Used a couple of times a week over 14 month period, so maybe that's all that can be expected of it.",0
never really knew if an acrylic platter could change the sound. but apparently it does,1
Not very sturdy. They are very fragile and thin. Sent back!,0
It will not turn on. It was a gift and the person called and said it does not work. It won't turn on. I would like to send back and get either another or my money back.,0
I enjoyed this book. The story was well-written and the characters were so life-like. I definitely recommend this book and look forward to reading more by this author.,1
I dislike this product it didnt hold water came smash in a bag and i just thow it in the trash,0
"It's been about a month since I have put it on my new phone. It's very pretty, design has not yet scratched off or fallen off; the clear material has NOT yellowed, and i like how it feels. It's very good quality and well worth the money. It comes with a phone stand that I dont really use but I do like it when I have used it. Good buy!",1
For the price this is the best paper. I love painting on this Very good product.,1
What a piece of shit ! Very disappointed,0
"Great product for a while, the hard plastic is a perfect fit! The problem is the rubber will start to fail in a year or two and the case will no longer be good. Shop around before you buy:)",0
Not cut to screen size of OnePlus 6. A bit smaller on the width and height. Will have to return.,0
I have been using this is in my room with peppermint oil to keep bugs away and it seems to be helping. I had no problem figuring out how to use it. I like how it has different timers and auto shut off. My only concern is the oil seems to go faster than the water and I go through a bunch of oil.,1
"This set looks great. However the tutus & tiaras smell like rotten eggs. Our party was 2 days after we received these items. We tried to revive them with fabric freshener, a dryer cycle, and airing them out. Nothing killed the stench. Super disappointed for my party princesses.",0
"I love this brand. The similarity to Fir Coat is a little bit disappointing, and both of those are very close to Salem (although Salem lacks the holographic glitter and has a black base rather than a deep blue, the colors are very close by merit of being dark blue/greens). I've TRIED to provide photos of all three for comparison, but for some reason I'm unable. I like them all and don't regret the purchase at all, it's quite cute and even if it's very close to Fir Coat...well, it's very close to one of my favorites so that isn't exactly a bad thing. As for the brand and the polish quality itself, I love this brand and find it has a lot of staying power even with the considerable abuse that I put it through. It removes well when I want it to, but holds up very well.",1
"The product looks as expected, the only downside is it’s flat. The picture makes it seem that hat had more depth. Meaning it more poking out you have to actually pull out Piece on the hat.",1
"If you are looking for some extension bit for your screwdriver, check this one out. I am expecting an extension bid holder for a while. And this one is new to me. Flexible! That means you can bend it to fit your needs. I gonna love it.",1
"Very comfortable, supportive, and fit perfectly.",1
The hinge came malfunctioned i contacted and would have to resend tje whole thing they wont just replace the hinge was very upset but my daughter loves it,1
We LOVE Crazy Aaron’s but this is SOOO LITTLE for $38. Like comically small.,0
"I bought a six pack of this product, but three of them were a different kind of deodorant I don’t use.",0
Way to small for a 10 year old,0
They didn’t fit in the tree I had,0
"Poor design in utilizing the phones features, and no amount back and forth with vendor will change that. It cheap for a reason... You invested a fair amount in the phone, so do the same for the case.",0
"Died after 90days of use, not durable as they said",0
Neither cord works after the first charger,0
"I bought this set for my son for Christmas because he is a huge Dinotrux fan, unfortunately two of the trucks were broke by Christmas night. The metal parts are well made, but the plastic is just junk.",0
Looks great and fits perfectly in my benz,1
Great price for this pretty set. It added the extra pop to our party decor.,1
The shirt is well designed and fits well. The color is really good,1
God loved them they were hot together like he said his half of a whole his Ying to his yang I loved everything about this book I hope X and Raven stay together and get only stronger together one isn’t the other without the other they need each other loved this book it is dark but smoking,1
Wish they had been wider. Takes two to go through each link,0
"These are rated very high, and I love that they are made from whole foods. But they make me very nauseous (I am not pregnant, but taking prenatal vitamins to prepare for pregnancy), and a serving size is 3 tablets at a time.",0
"I loved the idea of this... But now that I have it, I'm kind of disappointed, it's closed up in a way that if your gecko (or other reptile) is in it, you can't access the animal... This is great for feeling secure, but if you need to take your animal out for any reason, you'll have to take the whole hide out and hope the gecko comes out in a timely manner... Other then that, I like the design and size, it's bigger then expected",1
Very bright but doesn't turn off when exposed to natural or artificial light. Wouldn't buy again,0
It was exactly as advertised and very comfortable.,1
There is a recall on this unit due to fire hazard. How do I go about returning this?,0
"I like my rock, but it doesn't have any tabs or holes to use the two provided anchors. I will drill my own, but feel others should know,",1
"I'm normally very easy to entertain. This movie I struggled with. Seemed very disjointed. It was like they had a much longer story they wanted to tell, but chopped a ton of it out leaving many scenes without context. Acting was pretty good. CGI sets were a bit poor in many places. If this was based on a book I'd want to read it. Like others have said it has a neat concept.",0
Writing is too small to read otherwise a beautiful puzzle.,1
I just unboxed this freezer and its dented in multiple locations. Not what I expected from Amazon. I should have read all of the negative reviews because this apparently an issue with this brand. I plugged it in and it appears to be working. Bought a matching mini fridge at the same time and it is in a similar condition.,0
I am so disappointed. Protector broke as soon as soon as I tried to install it. I want my money back. 😑,0
And big plot holes. Big enough to drive a truck-bomb through.,0
Interesting but it seems more about him than Bess,1
Very nice a good flow for putting out the medicine . Very quiet machine..Being used daily works great...will order another,1
"This was the first time I purchased any Chemical Guys product. The problem I have encountered has never happened to me before. I have used all sorts of car care products from numerous companies and not once did the spray bottle malfunction or break on me. I was underneath my FJ and the spray bottle worked great for two sprays and then stopped. I never dropped it, I checked that it wasn't in 'off' position, I made sure the top was secured tightly. Still wont spray. I guess i can transfer to a new spray bottle but it has to be a new one because i dont want to chance getting another chemical mixed in.",0
"I finally found a glove that fits like a glove! Gloves I've purchased in the past just didn't seem to fit right. They were either to short, to tight or to big. This glove is the perfect fit. It's nice and snug and the wrist part actually comes down to my wrist and the magnetic marker is so handy to have there. I think I'll get a couple more of these while I can.",1
If I could give this 0 stars I would. It’s not at all what we ordered. Needed these cupcake rings for my daughters birthday party tomorrow and instead I am left with breast pump and breast milk accessory micro steam bags. Wtf.,0
"I really liked my purchase, I think it's a bit difficult to connect to wifi display from my laptop.",1
"Difficult to read the temperature scale. Since it stick on the outside, don't know how accurate it reads the water temperature. I prefer traditional inside thermometers.",0
it fits well with the exception it is a bit snug across the shoulders and bust area,1
This product was shipped on time. Unfortunately is was not the product featured in the listing. The listing claims it’s anti-perspirant. But what arrived at my door was deodorant. I have issued a disputed but the vendor has not responded.,0
This is just what I needed to add to my porch railing to block out my neighbors window looking right into my house. I added silk roses and silk ivy! Its so pretty and no view of the neighbor! Excellent buy.,1
"It's easy to use, has a slight scent that evaporates as it dries. So far this has been the best for my small one. His previous owner recommend this and I will forever be thankful.",1
they were too large I'm a woman's size 81/2 and I was not given an option to choose a size.,0
"Comforter looks very thin. Does not look like a full even though it was advertised as one! It has not been washed or used yet since it is a gift. Hopefully the stitching & color hold up. I am worried about the quality of this product just from looking at it. I really hope it can handle being used on a child's bed, since that it what it was intended for.... frequent wear & tear and frequent washing.... we'll see..... The price was a little high for such a thin ""comforter"", claiming to be for a full size bed. This barely covers a full!",0
The shirt is AMAZING it's just that its too small These shirts run small I'm super disappointed because I had purchased the green and had my name & birth year put on the back and can't even wear it .. Very sad 😞,1
Just got the product and tested over the weekend for a big party. It turned out great for the 8lb ribs my hubby cooked. Got lots of compliments from the guests!,1
"The dress looked nothing like the picture! It was short, tight and cheap looking and fitting!",0
I like these earbuds a lot! I bought these about 6 or 7 months ago and they still work great today! With the thick cord it does not tangle that much. The sound quality is phenomenal! If you are a fan of loud music I would definitely recommend these.,1
Not a very close shave!,0
Love frogger. Purchase came quick and in perfect condition,1
I think they were not adequate. Much too sunlight got through. Burned a lot.,0
"Overall this is seems to be working well. The motion detection is a little spotty, but it is easy to move to different spots around the yard. So far there has been a lot less squirrels in my garden.",1
"When I first brought this thing out of the box I was pissed, because it looks more like a toy than an effective piece of equipment...but don't let the look fool you. This thing is pretty hard core it's at least as bright as any other spot that I've owned, the flashlight option is also bright , and it takes and holds a charge for a long time.",1
They did nothing what the description said. I wore them not even 10 minutes and the began to fog up.,0
"Does it’s job but it just feels cheap in my hands. The seam between both sides of the cases noticeably feel awkward while holding the handle. For the price, it’s a great buy though.",1
This is not a remy human hair,0
This knife is amazing,1
"I try to turn it on, it won’t work so , it returned.",0
Easy to wire up easy to install great price,1
"Shipping took WAY to long even after I selected prime shipping, the case doesn’t look Like the picture it resembles it but it’s pretty cheap looking in person. 2 stars because it does have a nice bumper that’ll protect the screen if dropped",0
"No errors, no problems, gave my laptop a new lease on life !",1
The screen protector doesn't cover the entire screen. Very good packaging and presentation though,0
"This is a very nice book for the content, and I would recommend it as a resource for education. My complaint is that I purchased the book based on the “like new” description. Clearly, as you can see from the photos, this Book was NOWHERE near “like new” condition and unfortunately I bought based on this description. It was also packaged as “inspected” however the cover was clearly ripped from the binding. Anyway, just a warning for those purchasing from used listings, that the description of used may not be accurate/deceptive.",0
When I received it there was a power cord for the shaver but no cord for the cleaning system and the shaver cord dose not fit at all. The other problem is that there is no buttons on the cleaning system. The shaver work but that is it. Disappointed it the cleaner.,0
"This product is very small. The pictures are very deceptive and although I haven’t used them yet, I’m beginning to think this was a rip off because the price should be less due to the very small size of these. They’re only as wide as my pinky finger and as long as my index finger.",0
"I work in a warehouse and sometimes I have to move packages. The watch does not get caught on things or rub up against things, mainly because it is such a slim watch. Good buy",1
Worst purchase ever...bag is way too small cannot hold anything in it First time I opened the bag the bow at front came off in my hands Wasted my money,0
This is so adorable. Don't be put off by the thin material yes it's very thin material but you got to consider the price you're paying for it. But honestly it's so cute. When you get it definitely put it on because it looks actually much better on then you'd think. Runs small but I figured that and ordered a size larger for myself.,1
Perfect for my daughter! Arch support alleviated foot pain. She needs arch support and these are the only flip flops I have found that she can wear all day with no pain! Support yet cushioned,1
Using Bruce willis as a star in this movie suckered me into getting it. He was just window dressing,0
"If you enjoyed sky high, or simply love recognizing D-list canadian actors, I would give this one a go. It's an inoffensive way to spend an hour or so with a satisfying resolution. I thought they put a fair amount of thought into the powers they gave the kids, which were pretty original, and the cgi could have been worse. Fairly average saving the world deal with kids that bond and shit. If there was a gun to my head over this movie I would say lay off the trigger, champ.",1
Unfortunately my 8plus could not fit into it,0
"Loved this sleep mask. I have used lots of different sleep masks in the past, and this by far has been my favorite. Its adjustable , soft and keeps all the light out. I like the eye pads are concave so it's not resting right on your eyes.",1
"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel. I decided to wait until we moved into our home and I could set up my own Wifi system. March 2018- I have set up my Wifi system and this scale still won't connect. Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",0
They sent HyClean which is NOT for the US market therefore this is deceptive marketing,0
"Just what I thought I was buying, no complaints.",1
"While this product does work to keep the reflux in check, the side effects were pretty intense - bloating , gas for many hours after. I used it several times and got the same exact reaction. I think this may be due to the artificial sugar alcohols used to sweeten the tablets. Too bad they don't make a cleaner version of this. I've had better luck with lifestyle modifications in diet and making sure I eat sitting down, slowly and calmly (instead of standing up or eating while working.)",0
"Not really sure if it actually works, but it is broken. So I am returning it after one usage and get a new one. See picture, the screw came off. Impossible to put it back without messing everything up.",0
Soooo disappointed. The images look as though they are a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy to the point where they are so distorted and there is nothing to even color! You'd be better off making your own!,0
Nice umbrella while it worked. Now it won't stay open.,0
It was very nice! Niece enjoyed it very much! The heart in the wand popped out after dropping once but everything else was fine!,1
"I liked the style of these from the pictures because they looked a little more business professional compared to what I already own. Once I got them I didn't really like how they look on my face, but they work and the polarized lenses are decent. I look like a blind person wearing them but everyone needs a pair of throw-around glasses so these are it for me.",1
They work great. No way to change volume except with a Bluetooth device.,1
"Never received my order, took forever to respond to my messages.",0
It’s ok and not that great,0
Very easy install. Directions provided were simple to understand. Lamp worked on first try! Thanks!,1
Very durable. All in one product.,1
good fit good quality,1
"Tasted very good for a vitamin. However, did not see any difference in hair growth.",1
This was so easy to install and works great.,1
"these were a gift, and were too small. I had to go out and purchase locally",0
Made very cheap!!!! you get what you pay for,0
"Exquisite packaging, have USB C Adapter, my android, apple's old and new interface can be solved by one wire. It's great.",1
Very cute but fit was super loose! Very flimsy quality!,0
"Most worthless attempt at saving money I have ever encountered. Three of the exhaust runners either hit or miss-align the intake manifold. It took me more that 15 hours to cut and modify the runners to a point where they had an 1/8 of an inch clearance to the intake. Niw that I have everything assembled, and without touching the down pipe connections, now the downpipe is over a half inch off. To make matters worse, the connecting joint is almost too big for the flares on the downpipe and to top it all of, the supplied hardware is almost am inch and a half too short.",0
"These glasses are made well, and are durable for motorcycle rides. The only issue I have is that the lenses don't get as dark as I'd prefer. They get as dark as the middle shade in the picture of the sunglasses. I have not seen them get as dark as the top pair of sunglasses in the picture. It is super convenient to not have to take them off/ change to a different pair of shades when it becomes night.",1
"Pathetic design of the caps. Very impractical to use everyday. The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap. With a baby in one hand opening the cap is a night mare. And on top of these extra ordinary features of super secure cap, they are so expensive when compared to other brands. Stay away from these until they fix the cap issues. We have hurt ourselves many time trying to open caps as they have sharp edges on the inner and outer edges. Not worth the price.",0
love these Los Muertos skulls i have 2 of them on a chain they are a decent size and the detail on the skulls is crisp,1
So far so good. It came right on time.,1
Great set for the family,1
The sound quality is poor. It kept skipping.,0
I like this toothpaste a lot.,1
Do not waste your money on this product! The tie mechanism is defective.,0
I never received the items,0
"I love it It is adorable , perfect size! But my glass part has a crack, can you please replace the glass part? Thank you",0
"Really pretty ring, not had it long enough to say if it will wear well or not",1
Arrived on time and in perfect condition! Very PRETTY!,1
"I wasn't paying attention and was utterly dismayed to realize this thing is 20 pages. I read the whole thing, thinking it was a sample from a book, and then suddenly no more. I need more!!",1
"Nothing special, This stuff is very thick. Then you leave it on and it dries up and needs a cake to layer on the skin that you can clean off with a moist towel. It also dries up some wh, This stuff is very thick. Then you leave it on and it dries up and leaves a cake layer on the skin that you can clean off with a moist towel. It also dries up somewhat matte- like toothpaste- instead of dewy. I have used better hydrating and moisturizing products.",0
"These bags are exactly what I was looking for when trying to find bags to carry supplies to and from school. What I did not realize is that one of them is a little skinnier than the others, but overall they work great!",1
Ordered 4 boxes to stock for staff at work. They all came looking like they got ran over by a truck. They used the worst packing available.,0
great buy for the money. Wife likes them for short trips out of the house,1
Small and compact...Despite oil it does not emit much fragrance at all. Very disappointed.,0
Does not match dark skin,0
"The one I gave this as a gift to likes it. So, I am good with that:)",1
"Difficult to open tools. Tried oiling, didn't help much. Had to use a screwdriver to pry tools open.",0
I didn't like it I received the wrong product,0
"several of the balls did not squeak at all. Overall, poor quality",0
Some of the balloons were sealed shut and would not blow up.,0
Fantastic buy! Computer arrived quickly and was well packaged. Everything looks and performs like new. I had a problem with a cable. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent me out a new one. I can't say enough good things about about this purchase and this computer. I will definitely use them again.,1
We bought this to use as a panel control for our home security system. It only works for couples of month then stop working.,0
"Best described as historical fiction, although not in the romantic sense, this novel is exceedingly well written. I was pulled into Charles' life from the first page. I loved the development of the character, Charles, and his alter ego Bulldog. I did not find the story dull or slow moving, as the critical reviewers did - the pace was just right for me. The writing is an integral part of the story, as Charles is an aspiring reporter. Entertaining and immersive, there is also some suspense and tension as Charles becomes involved with not one but 2 crime families on his way to realizing his dream.",1
"nice ointment, a bit runny but moisturizes well. There just a few ingredients and they are all natural. no preservatives. I recommend this product!",1
I expected a sturdy one as shown in the picture. As advertised it seems that the material used in the product can be open and will remain upright but the actual product does not. It looks durable though but it has to be tested during my travel when I decide to use it. I was expecting the bra cups will not be squeezed but sadly it does. I want to return both the small and the large bags but I will be leaving already and don’t have time to do it.,0
Piece of crap. Plugs have to be wiggled into place. Last one dies after 4 months. We don't make anything anymore. I guess I should try to find an extension cord at n antique store or make one myself.,0
Strange products not advertised with jalapeños and nothing good. All chips were packed on top and smashed.,0
Mouse ON/OFF button location could be located somewhere more feasible.,1
So surprised at how soft it was. Washes up wonderfully.,1
This has worked for me. The grandson can’t push it down . He does not try to put toys under it either. I just make sure we are in the room with him. It works better than what I had up around the banister.,1
Picture makes it look like you get two but they only deliver one,0
Good price for set. It comes in a chic little black velvet pouch. There are 2 styles of straws and 4 sizes. Also with color coded grips which I thought was nice so you can use them for the whole family or for guests.i really like the environmental aspect of these.,1

"You cannot use a different microphone than the one that came with your camera. This is a major limitation, which means you can't make a video with high quality sound. It claimed to be a webcam, but after an hour of modification, I gave up. You have to download a third-party app to complete, for the price, this is medium, the iPhone can definitely shoot better videos, I don't recommend buying",0
"The problem is any missing instructions what to do with the product after arrival. It smells horribly, it colours all water yellow. From web I found that I should soak it for a long time (in my case I soaked it for 3 days replacing water several times). This removes significant amount of colouring and smell. Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",1
On first use it didn't heat up and now it doesn't work at all,0
Don't buy this game the physics are terrible and I am so mad at this game because probably there are about 40 hackers on every single game and the game. Don't doesn't even do anything about it you know they just let the hackers do whatever they want and then they do know that the game is terrible but they're doing absolutely nothing about it and the game keeps on doing updates about their characters really what they should be updating is the physics because it's terrible don't buy this game the physics are terrible and mechanics are terrible the people that obviously the people that built this game was high or something because it's one of the worst games I've honestly ever played in my life I would rather play Pixel Games in this crap it's one of the worst games don't buy,0

"Quality of cover was not as expected, showed wear lines after one week of use",0
it looks good. I like it. gift for my wife.,1
"The pods smell fantastic, but the coffee comes out super weak and barely has any flavor to it. :/ I’m glad I also bought the Breakfast Blend. Wouldn’t buy this again.",0
This book goes up against an easy to use and simple to take after outline that will enable you to achieve your weight reduction objectives on the ketogenic eat less more rapidly and strongly than before.This eating regimen takes after the Atkins thin down and other low-carb diets.The recipes are incredibly alluring and at first look enough fundamental.i particularly recommend this.,1
I need more these are awesome for keeping things neat and clean. Looks like a pro did it!,1
"It's a nice light mount. The only issue I have with it is that it turns on my handlebar. I even put some double-sided tape underneath it before I wrapped the strap around in the hopes that it would stay in one spot, but it still doesn't. It's strapped as tightly as it can be. I gave it 4 stars because otherwise, I like it due to its lightness and flexibility.",1
Very sturdy and light weight. Used it for my hammock,1
My cheerleaders loved being able to pick out their own socks,1
"Very short on the sides. Overall, good fit but I do not like to show my belly. Too bad lad got that. Fabric very soft.",0
"Fit as expected, minus the thigh bands being a bit too tight. My main concern is how extremely thin they are. They feel cheaply made and am certain they'll snag/run my first wear.",0
Not what I expected. Picture is very deceiving.,0
Was recommended to me and was all she said it would be,1
"The game gets more complex as you proceed. You have to have a keen eye to get through it, and I enjoy a challenge!",1
"A complete and utter piece of garbage. I never damaged, dropped, or neglected this device and by the end of 3 months it is no longer charging. The response time is abysmal when trying to access apps. Then, once accessed, the phone takes it upon itself to kick you OUT of the app. The screen, at times, is completely unresponsive. The memory is virtually gone with just the addition of a few basic apps. Sometimes you get a good product at a good price. Other times, you get exactly what you pay for. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID.",0
It was of good quality but pretty thin.,1
This is a solid comb. It's perfect for my mustache and it fits nicely in my pocket.,1
Never received product,0
"I can not tell you how many times I have bought one of these. My dogs are obsessed with them! The legs don’t last long but the rest of it does, probably one of the longer lasting toys they have had.",1
"Machine was easy to assemble, and is small enough for easy storage. Moving the machine around is easy due to the lightness of it and the attached wheels. My only complaints are that the seat is a little hard, the accessory holder is not really big enough to hold a lot of remotes or anything else, and the iOS app that is included does not accurately track distance. When I get off the machine I will note the distance, time and calories burned but when I check on the app or website the distance is about 60% of what the machine/app reported during the workout itself.",1
Did not receive it yet. Was unaware it was being shipped from China.,0
"I love the pillow in the picture but unfortunately, mine does not look like that. The fabric is yellowish, texture looks different and the colors/ink are blotchy and running into the other colors. I uploaded pics but honestly looks worse in person.",0
"It wasn't what I thought it was so I sent it back , for someone that ordered the right thing the process was perfect",0
Very happy with this Tahini. Not bitter. Color is a little darker than I expected but who cares. It's delicious. Note this is Tahini made with the sesame hulls not removed and that's why I ordered it and believe is the reason it's darker in color. Most Tahini is made with the hulls removed. This Tahini is thicker but very smooth. I will be ordering more.,1
wast of money fake did one launch broke a immediately.,0
Pretty good for the money,1
"I appreciate how the author explains all about CBT. This made it easy to apply concepts to my personal life and challenges faced by others. Negative thoughts and feelings are very common and here is a way of great help, even to those who are not depressed but deal with people that are. Thank you!.",1
"I tried several if the heads it came with, but none of them seemed to work.",0
I received this product today when I opened the box it was missing the creme developer.,0
Very small bar of soap .,0
Works perfect for the area I needed at..,1
Exactly what you need to cut & strip fresh herbs and leafy greens. Easy to use and clean. Great safety tab that allows you to retract blades. Super easy to clean. Much better quality than others I’ve used & broken. Plastic could be a tad thicker to make it last longer - but at this price it can’t be beat that’s my only quasi-complaint. Still ranks as one of the best I’ve found after purchasing & breaking 2 other brands previous to this.,1
i mean it’s great and all but it smells really bad. like really really bad. if i would’ve known what it smells like i would’ve ordered it somewhere else,0
"Initially this chlorine generator worked great for my above ground pool. However, as the summer wore on, it began to get very sensitive about the flow and shut off. I followed the directions contained in the manual and set it self-clean the electrodes while it worked. It didn't help much. By August it began telling me I had low-salt. I tested the salt several times and knew it was within the optimal range for the product. So I dissembled it and cleaned the electrodes. It worked for a day and returned to telling me I had flow problems. Within a week it told me I had low-salt again. I had to treat my pool with purchased chlorine for the rest of the season. I am disappointed the product that should have lasted two seasons, didn't even make it one.",0
I wanted to give one star. Not for the quality of the book or the writing but for the story. Crushing. I'd like to read an update from the author.,1
Not sure what happened but I got regular lotion not shower lotion. It's okay.,0
Works perfectly. Only criticism might be that the OD doesn’t match so it’s very apparent that an adapter is being used but glad to be able to use old attachments!,1
"Slow read, having a hard time getting through this book.",0
"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."" HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind. You can turn the plug upside down so that the thumb screws are on the underside of the baffle, but it will take you hours to turn those screws; no tool will do it, and only the tiniest fingers would have an easy time of it. It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA. I ordered four of these; the three that I didn't open are going straight back and I'm in the market for better weather guards. (Let's face it; there's nothing like this which will actually ""baffle"" squirrels!)",0
Whoever packed this does not care or has a lot to learn about dunnage.,0
As far as nutritional value it appears to be high-quality the taste is unbearable and why I rated it at 2 star it does help to put honey in your glass with it.,0
Using these for board-game bits!,1
"I came to depend on wireless chargers from when I had an iPhone 8. Unfortunately, my charger was not compatible with my new phone (11 model). This one from Anker is a different company, but it works just as well. The charging is quick and it works with the phone's leather style case. I wasn't sure if I would get another wireless charger but a couple of weeks plugging and unplugging quickly changed my mind. And for the relatively low price, this one is a great deal.",1
Camera was shaky and made me dizzy. Extra star for the ending. Strange.,0

"I bought this a couple months ago to be prepared for the summer, and when I went to use it this week it doesn’t work! I have tried both batteries and neither seem to charge. It turned on one time for about 5 minutes and nothing since. What a disappointment! Do not buy, it’s a waste of money! Update: shortly after reading my review the company reached out to me and sent me TWO replacements that have been working great! I greatly appreciate them replacing it free of charge!",1
Great seller and customer service!,1
"Have had probs with Hockey Balls. My dog loves them - her favorite fetch and chew toy - and they float. That is until she chews them to bits. Tried several, even the ""hot weather"" versions - and they lasted a few minutes longer than the others. Until these showed up. These have stood the test. My dog is not big but she is stubborn about what she chews. Like they say, its not how big the dog in the fight but how big the fight in the dog. Thumbs up from Daisy and I.",1
"I've tried this thing for a few days and I'm shocked. First night there were none. The second day I checked periodically and saw 3 stuck on it. Ok cool. The next time I checked they were all gone.... wait what?! Then I watched one of these tricky little creeps get stuck upsidedown, do a back bridge out of the stickiness until he flipped over on his legs and JUMPED OFF THE STICKY PAD! I'm flabbergasted. Useless. Make your pads stickier! And yes I removed the film.",0
"Item arrived in box with no padding. The part of the case that connects to the hose was broken off. Returned item, still waiting for refund.",0
I used two of them to stabilize 20 foot of waste line and they're doing the job perfectly so far. Very satisfied.,1
"Ahh! I hate to write this review... I've been a die-hard Schmidt's user for almost a year now. I've loved my natural deo, as I'm a sweaty person. It's always been easy to apply, and even the next day, no sense of body odor coming through! Help control smell, sweating, no more pit stains.. AMAZING! It seriously changed my life. Until, about a month ago, I got another round of sticks, and this time, I'm developing rashes within a couple days. I've gone off it, and it's cleared up, but within a day or two of coming back, these Very, Very, painful lumps and bumps pop up. I'm not sure if they've changed the baking soda balance or what, but I can no longer use this deodorant. It's too painful. I've started seeing more and more comments and reviews on the web about similar experiences. I'd love to come back to this product in the future. --note, nothing else about my hygiene or lifestyle has changed.",0
Love the colors & works well with my versa!,1
I tried so hard to get into this book and storyline but I couldn't do it. The story jumped all over the place with too many side stories. The love story was so drawn out and just too hard for me to really enjoy. I wished for more but the book left me hanging all over the place.,0
"I have had this around a year now and it is still working as it should - it lasted outside in Michigan weather, Summer / Winter. Might be the location i put it in but sometimes it doesnt come on as quickly as we would like though.",1
Got a completely different item.,0
"I was surprised it actually taste like chocolate, and not a bad chocolate. My toddlers ate it like a candy and so did my husband and I.",1
This mop is pure rubbish! There are no directions in the box and I cannot get it to work. The mop head is quite small and I don’t expect the hard plastic components to last. I would return this if only I had opened the package immediately. Unfortunately my return window has closed so this will go out with the rest of my trash on Friday.,0
"This shampoo has a wonderful fragrance. It lathers up easily so I did not need to use an excessive amount om my large dogs' The Oatmeal and other ingredients seemed to be effective on the itch and irritation of my dog's skin. So far so good, I think I'll buy it again although after three baths x two dogs there is plenty in the bottle.",0

"Look great, good quality. Needed to cut a notch in the drivers side front support bracket to get it to fit properly.",1
Might have to wash a few times,1
Hard to use. A bit flimsy,0
I used this on my bed as a cover for my mattress under my fitted sheet and I love it it has deep pockets so it doesn’t slip of my mattress constantly,1
I guess some dogs just don't care,0
"Works well, having the two zippers is handy when you want to carry a phone and not have all your money/cards go flying when having to remove the phone for use. My daughter uses this one mostly as I preferred one with a bigger pocket but it's more her style and more like a belt than a fanny pack which at 19 years old is apparently a big deal!!",1
"I really wanted to like these. I got them specifically for driving as they have better allowance for peripheral vision. Problem is, like most low price point sunglasses they have a lens distortion. The distortion is subtle/minimal compared to other cheap models however it is most definitely still there and will wear on your eyes in the end. What a shame - otherwise the frame quality is quite good",0
"Purchased this case in June. It cracked about a month ago and now it completely snapped. There was no outside influence kn the case. Since being installed it had never been dropped or attempted to remove. It's a nice case, too bad it's useless when it doesn't protect the product.",0
"My Doberman Loves Having His Nails Trimmed and His Ears Cleaned When These Treats Are Present, I'd say he's a pushover and I owe a lot to these tasty treats. I will buy again!!",1
Nice but not worth the price. Very flimsy. Can come apart very easily. The thin burlap threads right away came off.,0
Best flashlight I've ever owned. Love the magnetic base and its extremely bright. It's not 2000 lumen. Friend at work had 1500 lumen light that was a bit brighter. A little bulky to fit in your pocket though. But you get 2 of them so I'm not complaining!,1
"Bought this product as a replacement to the factory screen protector. From the start there were issues, even though some were minor I might as well list all of them. 1. Box has the instructions but they had a giant product sticker covering all of it. I didn't need the insturctions, but this could be difficult for other people who might not know how to. 2. The edges are not smooth and beveled so mine already cracked with less than 2 weeks of use. I have normal items in my pocket such as keys my phone. 3. Case made a slight sticky noise when typing or using the phone, I just drowned out the sound eventually. 4. Glass seems to be a fingerprint magnet. Just after the application of the new screen I noticed how all the touches appeared on the screen. Overall. I will use the second one since I got two, don't want to waste money. Will most likely by a factory one and spend the extra $$. Only reason I replaced it was because the original screen protector cracked doing its job.",0
"Edited review (POST-con): LOVE this wig!! It's SO CUTE on and I got so many compliments for my Wreck it Ralph 2 costume!! I trimmed it a bit in certain places (it was pretty uniform on the top, so I cut some pieces to get dimension), and I pulled a LITTLE volume from the top (though it didn't do much, tbh). I wore it all day at the con and the ""tangling"" is minimal for what it is. For non-lace-front, this is great quality!",1
Cute and can change colors with outfits. Gave 4 stars because they tend to loosen up after wearing a while.,1
I love the cologne of it ever is actually delivered. They said it arrived 2 weeks ago and that I have to pick it up? Then what is the point of using Amazon is I still have to go pick it up. Amazon you are slipping so bad lately!,0
I like this swim suit but it fits really small. I am a size 14 and per reviews that's what I ordered. It runs really small. Also a lot of mesh in the back and on the sides of this suit. Don't like that. its going back....sad,0
The protective seal was broken when I received this item and a large amount of the contents had spilled out of the container into the plastic bag that the item was in. This was a huge disappointment as you should never use any product when the protective seal has been broken. This caused a major delay in several of my DIY projects that I needed this product for to make several Christmas gifts.,0
The tv arrived with a shattered screen and Best Buy would not take it back. I opened the box after the return date and didn’t realize it was broken. Probably in transit. Best Buy should still take it back if it’s damaged.,0
Taste isnt the greatest but what vitamin is. I dont take any vitamin or medicine without food or drink anyway. So as long as you do that then your fine. I actually bought for this my pregnant daughter. She agrees with this review. I like the fact that they have iron in them which my vitamins dont. So thats a plus right there for me and just about any pregnant woman.,1
I did not receive my package yet The person Noel B is not living here I don't know Him Please take a picture of the person you giving the package thank you,0
"I'm going to first be honest in saying I was VERY skeptical of a glass file having the ability to shine my nails, without damaging them. I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised when I first used one. No damage to my nails, and a perfect shine to them! I love that this file is dual purpose, and small enough to fit in my purse, or zippered wallet for quick on the go carrying.",1
The belts are good. They look good but were too small.,1
Wish I would have spent money for better quality. You get what you pay for though. They are very fragile (break easily) and don't want to stay up. We had to use yard staples to secure it. And if it's windy at all....forget about it!,0
"spacious , love it and get many compliments",1
"These unfortunately fell apart after one wash in cold water and low heat dryer. They’re very soft, and mostly wrinkle resistant, but not durable at all!",0
"Paired with the Phillips flood LEDs. These cause very minor flickering but pronounced flashing. They don't hold the brightness steady. There is also significant dead space in the lower range of adjustment. I think most people are not too picky. Also, dinner if there fluctuation is the electrical system itself. Ultimately these just work ok with LEDs.",0
"The end of the Car Pool fits perfectly in most plastic bottles from water or soda. The extension is highly flexible making it easy to position and use. I haven't bought this as a gift yet, but plan to. Also, my wife wants to bring this on a hiking trip so she can use it while hiking on the trail in the back country.",1
"I have ordered these several times but in the last batch seems the cut out is different now, and the mask is so wide and then the nose piece is shorter so it doesn't even cover my nose. Won't be ordering again.",0
"If you need centering rings for your wheels and the size you need is made by this brand, stop reading this and just go order them. I'm on my 2nd set (2nd car) and in both cases plastic rings were tried first and always caused wheel wobble at various speeds. Dropped these aluminum rings on and all wheel wobble is gone.",1
"I bought these candle holders for my baby shower and we were unable to use them because the bolts that came with them were too big and the candle holders were too wobbly to use...this purchase was a waste of money! We tried everything, including glue, and nothing worked!! Nothing stabilized these candle holders.",0
It doesn't smell as good on me as my friend.,1
"I ordered two routers and they came packaged and appearing to be new but after several hours of trying to figure out why one was not showing up on my network although it was working, I eventually figured out it had a manually assigned IP address unrelated to any address I use and I had to factory reset the device in order to get it to work correctly. So clearly this thing was packaged as new but it was not. I will see if it works it seems to be working but I am quite concerned that I received a router with pre-existing information programmed inside of it.",0
Awesome book that is straightforward and to the point. Very useful information and a great straight point for anyone interested in this topic.,1
"Very nice, beautiful designs!",1
Does not fit average tv,0
I loved the first book so much had to read the sequel. Actually couldn't believe it was even better than the first,0
"Material seems to be good, but came apart after a few uses.",0
"For the most part I enjoyed my shopping. I would like the item represented more to size,color,shape etc. A written representation would help. Delivery,payment,things like that were very simple and made the experience a good one. Thanks",1
Made a money gift fun for all,1
"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! I bought it to transfer VHS video to computer as it was advertised to do well. 1) There was nearly no color in my recordings when using this converter. I confirmed it was the converter by directly watching the VHS recording directly on a TV using the same composite outputs, 2) The software is way outdated (9 years in fact), 3) The product cannot be returned. Don't waste your money or your time !!!!!!!!!",0
Fairly comfortable ankle weights that can be weight adjusted. Good for increasing resistance in light workouts. Useful for back exercises that use legs.,1

"These puppets are absolutely darling. I would have given them a five star, but wanted to comment on that the finger holders themselves could have been longer.

"Fast delivery, fair price. Using the product to keep drains clear at a beauty salon.",1
"I liked the plot of Pulse and the author’s choice to focus on an underrepresented segment of our population in this book. The only criticism I have is that I guessed one of the villains when introduced, and I’m usually completely unable to do that. Still, the book is a great, enjoyable read for those who enjoy murder mysteries.",1
"I am very satisfied with this Wooden LED Alarm Clock! It’s so beautiful! The color is as what it shows online - wooden pretty black and very neat. The size is perfect for a nightstand or desk area. Set-up is easy! All you need are 4 AAA batteries. The instruction manual is pretty easy to understand, so entering the settings is no problem. And the alarm has a nice assertive sound to it, so you will definitely be woken up! What attract me most is the smart design: The time light turns off automatically so it keeps the room dark at night, but a clap or knock the table will make it on again. Both my wife and I like it so much!",1
These boots are CHEAP for leather boots. You get what you pay for. Mine started falling apart within 4 months of buying them. I will say they are fairly water proof surprisingly.,0
I had these desk top fan since Christmas 2017 and only used them a hand full of times and now the fans don’t even work. What a waste of money.,0

Does not work as described.,0
"Good quality, versatile fit. Very good value compared to other belts.",1
Great to refurbish a compacted lawn. Assembly is a pain but this is heavy duty and not cheaply built. Local hard ware store visit is needed to buy blocks for weighting down. It tore up my clay perfectly with deep plugs. Down side is getting on and off the lawn mower to raise/lower the times when coming to a driveway or sidewalk.,1
Phone has scratches all over it after less than a month of regular using,0
My cat used to love this stuff and would wait for me to put on her food before she would eat it. Now she backs away from it. I can tell the texture and color has changed too.,0
The length was good. Quick delivery but the color looks more greenish then gray. I desperately need them so can't return. Will try to get another color.,0
Ordered the new style strap locks but received the old style! The old style is still a great product but I didn't order it!,0
So liquid that it poured! Very disappointed!!!,0
"I love the way these look, different especially for the price, BUT the Velcro barely stays shut as my daughter walks. The leg/ankle section is too small when the Velcro is closed, hence why it opens right up as she’s walking. I’d be afraid a larger size would be too big in the toe region.",1
I like the top but the bottom was not sized correctly. I had to return it,0
It is not mush of guide.It kinda sucks I wish I wanted for the official one,0
"I bought this for my husband. These are good and do the job. My only problem is that I wish the top was attached. It is quite a bit of work to get the bottle in, but once in, the drink stayed cold.",1
I really like it and it works very well. My only complaint is that this is the second one I've purchase and the 2nd time the plastic black comb has broken. Is there anyway to get that piece replaced?,1
"Feels good in the hand. As other reviews said, the stitching on the M emblem is a little dodgy, but for the price it's a great upgrade.",1
"I bought the steak and chicken for my Brussels Griffon, she tried one of each and she will not eat them again. She doesn’t like them. They really have no smell to them and they look dry and hard. Wasted my money. She does love her dental bone from Wilderness. She gets one every morning. Now... it looks like a real bone.",0
"Very fake, not fresh flavor. No one in my family or neighborhood would eat it at our block party.",0
"I love this compact bag, but the cell phone pocket is too small for my phone:( Otherwise it is very roomy for cash, credit cards and a few other essentials. Perfect when you don't want to carry a big purse.",1
The top fits slightly loose and the bottoms are a bit to small. The top has no support or built in bra. The bottoms are pictured as boy shorts but in all actuality are more like panty bottoms. I gave it two stars because the design of the top was very nice.,0
I have been using this product for the past 5 days and it seems to work to an extent.,1
This is a knock off product. This IS NOT a puddle jumper brand float but a flimsy knock off instead. It is missing all stearns and puddle jumper branding on the arms. Do not buy!,0
"These ""tights"" are very thin, which I didn't expect given that they were also described as cropped pants. They are too small, although I ordered the large that was specified for my size (I wear a 6 or 8 in U.S. sizes). I can barely get them on, and I am afraid of ripping them. I will probably not wear them; not what I expected at all.",0
"Cook delicious, healthy and easy to prepare straight from my kitchen. This book all foods very good take this book you can weight loss easily.You can improve self-confidence day by day.",1

"Bought August 20, and by the end of September the whole top by the straps was ripped. Was hoping it would at least last until Christmas. This was for a kindergarten student, so she was not even carrying books.",0

"I have been finding it difficult to find some decent truck seat covers that don't cost an arm and a leg. I thought these would be just what I needed until I went to put them on and found out that our truck's head rests cannot be removed. Haven't decided yet whether I will be returning these or if I want to take the time to make some alterations to the seat cover so I can get it over the head rest. Seller should mention that the head rest needs to be removed to be able to install properly. I do like the purple color :) I have yet to find out if the seat cover actually fits the seats in our 2018 Chevy Silverado 1500. Amazon claims these fit, but I haven't been able to try them out yet.",0
"The shoes are super comfortable, but the bottom of the shoe came off since the beginning and I tried to put some glue but still came off later. Really disapointed",0
I loved loved the color and material of the cosmetic bag. It fit perfectly into my backpack for travel.,1
They just stop working after 6 to 7 catches... i bought so many... my neighbors moved and its a must... so i keep replacing them... still buying them practically every month...costly,0
Cheap made but not cheap price. Wire in wing took no time to be poking out.,0
"First use on July 3, 2018 in readiness for Fourth of July get together. September 3, 2018 it stopped working. Replaced batteries and it won't work. The blue light indicates when powered On, however, the light won't stay lit. It will flash when On/Off button pressed, otherwise no light, no operation. The unit needs a redesign so moisture or soap doesn't leak into the battery compartment corroding the connections. It's very attractive, but useless if it doesn't do anything. :(",0
"I purchased this to replace the screen on my friend’s 6s plus. I’ve replaced numerous iPhone screens in the past. This one, as soon as I powered on the phone, had a cluster of dead pixels in the middle of the display. Also, the home button was completely non-functional. I’m not just talking about TouchID. I mean the home button was completely dead. I tried moving a functional home button to the new display and it didn’t work either so there was obviously an issue with something in the replacement part. Fortunately, Amazon offered me a refund so I’ve purchased a different replacement part that will hopefully work better.",0
"I thought this would be a great gift for my eight-year-old grandson and he was wildly excited about it, but the screws were so tiny and hard to handle and the holes for them so misaligned, that assembly was nothing but frustration for both of us. I ended up returning it.",0
So I installed these in my rv and the color seems to very from light to light. Kind of dim and some were just not warm white as described but a blue tint or white color.,0
Bought it on December broke on me on February. Got an E1 error meaning hardware fault. Second time I bought this only to break a couple months later. Buyer beware.,0
Good fit. As expected.,1
The bungee cord in the sticks for assembly broke after one use.,0
Price was right. works perfectl on Kawasaki 550 mule.,1
"Its good, does the job but a bit too thin. You need to be gentle otherwise it will tear. If its a critical job, dryer vent for example, you will need to double or triple it. 3M Heavy Duty is still the best though, so if quality is more important to you than cost, then thats the way to go. For every day jobs, regular duct work, this is fine.",1
Almost all of the packages were hard to chew so I didn't bother opening the rest :(,0
We have watched all of the Madagascar movies and I felt this was the best one. It was very entertaining and we’ve seen it many times and still enjoy it.,1
This outfit was made in 5 minutes or less I believe. It was poor quality. Save your money,0
Donated but cute and good quality,1
Perfect flatware set and has a nice heavy weight to them making them perfect for use and not cheap of flimsy,1
It loses data and files become corrupt on a regular basis. Piece of junk.,0
"My dog really likes it. I got her a MEDIUM because I wanted to save a little money and it works fine for her ,she's a pit bull mix and 45 pounds . It did take her a while for her to realize she can lie on it ,but once she did she wouldn't leave it. Now let's hope she doesn't rip it to shreds ha",1
"Well, Here's the deal...The product arrived on time and in good condition. Very nice packaging makes this perfect for gift wrapping and giving as present. It also come with a nice storage bag and glass case along with a lens cloth. These are plastic lenses...so use the protective cases or they will scratch just like any other plastic lens. These are of the blue blocker variety and they work! Nicely styled with lightweight aluminium alloy frames and comfortable nose pads. I plan to use them for shooting at the range, as well as for night driving. Good bang for the buck...if you protect them. There you have it.",1
It didn't fit my phone,0
Plays really good Thanks ☺,1
I ordered 2 of them. One was broken at the bottom when I opened it. I contacted the seller had they had me send them pictures of it being broken and the order information. Once they receive that and three to four days later they reply was to contact Amazon. Would not recommend buying these from the seller,0
Love the look of them but only had them for 3 months an one of the lights burned out:/,0
Did not fit very well,0
It states this curtain can be used as is for a shower however upon the first use it became quite saturated and this continued after my next few showers. I gave up and had to get a clear liner because I didn't want mold.,0
Lacked very much taste but worth the try,0
"A word of caution on color. This is not blue as shown, but rather a greenish hue with hints of blue. Otherwise it is a nice silk flower. I wanted something more blue vs. more green.",0
"Some adjustment is needed in order to get this hanging basket to look like the picture. Actually, a lot of adjustment. Fortunately the stems, which are overly long, do bend if patiently worked with and in time I'll be happier with the ""look"" of this basket than I presently am. A few more blossoms would have been nice, too, but overall this faux-plant definitely looks like a geranium. The colors and the leaf/blossom sizes are excellent. So while it's still a work-in-progress, I'm reasonably pleased with this purchase and actually am enjoying remodeling it.",1
Was pretty good and arrived at a reasonable time,1
My daughter's 12 and this was too tight,0
I bought this item to cushion my lip and move my lip/cheek away from the chewing surface of my teeth. Halfway through the box I found the quality dropped off and the poorly produced rolls were too thin and did no cushioning. This resulted in no small amount of pain.,0
It had a broken valve that I fixed but the product itself may have already lost it holding. It does not work,0
"The size is perfect and matches one I purchased for the larger double sink many years ago. Mat was somewhat thinner than the larger sink mat, but is working well.",1
This app is so cute I love it sm,1
Loved this mouse when I first got it...but it only lasted less than 6 months before it died... :(,0
"My co-worker had the previous model, which included retractable ear buds and a hard case for storage. She highly recommended it, so I purchased this more recent model hoping for those some benefits, but they were not included. These work great, especially for the price point, but be prepared to sacrifice those previous conveniences.",1
"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",0
I ordered this specifically for the thin red line ring. The original order did not have the red but two of the silver lines. I called amazon to get it fixed. They sent the same exact item with no thin red line ring. Called Amazon again and they couldn’t figure out a solution.,0
Sealing doesn't work!,0
"It's such a shame. These brushes are perfect, but the mini one snapped and broke in less than a week. I wasn't even using it roughly just cleaning out the nipple piece on the bottle. They should either better design the mini brush to be stronger or at least give you a replacement head. Very annoying.",0
"I take Carnitine for recovery and endurance, this product does the job, and does it well.",1
First order delivered was missing; ordered another one and was double charged. Product is thin and pages are even thinner. Disappointing on multiple levels.,0
"Looks like it would have been a very nice set. It arrived completely shattered and I got glass in my finger. So, needless to say the package should have been wrapped much better.",0
"Didn’t work at all for what I needed. Based on the pictures it looked more flexible but I broke my toe and this was so bulky. Also, I tried freezing it but it only stayed cold for a few minutes. I sent it back. Maybe would work better for a big toe.",0
MUST HAVE MISREAD AD WAS NOT AWARE THAT SCREEN HEAD DOES NOT DETACH FROM RAZOR MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CLEAN OTHERWISE GOOD CLEAN SHAVE,1
"This book, while sort of science fiction, has credible people and places. The pace is like a Dan Brown book",1
Very dissatisfied! Product ordered was for 3 months and received supply for ALMOST 1 months worth. Bottle also says 3 months supply. They are deceiving and not to be trusted. ONLY SELECTED ONE STAR BECAUSE THERE IS JO OPTION FOR ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!,0
"I like this, and wish it had fit me, It didn't but a friend I showed it to loved it and it fit her, it was close to her birthday , so a perfect birthday gift!",1
". Fit my 2018 Accord pretty good the back part of the seat isnt fully covered completely but most is, Came a bit wrinkled but not to bad, material is actually good quality",1
Taste great and makes for a perfect snack to keep in your desk draw bc of ye seal. Hard to find in grocery stores.,1
Easy to clean. Chocolates and fat bombs come out easy and with the imprint perfectly.,1
"Way better than Stevia. No bad aftertaste like Stevia or Truvia! If you are substituting for sugar, I would just add about 30% more than the recipe calls for.",1
I'm restringing a necklace that had cord & leather. The leather gave out. So far so good.,1
"I bought this to wear with leggings while pregnant, and it does the job. I don't love the pattern; it seems more like a poorly tie dyed shirt in person, but for my purposes, it's okay. It seems a little more ""middle aged woman"" than trendy young mom, so I don't anticipate wearing it much once I'm not carrying a human inside me.",1
My hubs is just dealing with it but hates it. The side leather trim started peeling one day after use. Pretty disappointing.,0
"Kat has her hands full trying to solve the murder of a judge---and clear her husband's name. He is a district attorney and is too busy trying to get on top of a case that he inherited only a day or two before--thanks to that judge! So, in-between attempting to write her next book, taking care of the dogs and cooking so her husband will at least eat one meal a day--she calls on everyone possible to get to the bottom of this. She really meets up with some interesting characters. And of course everyone is telling her what they know--the phone is ringing off the hook--and she is using a lot of gas!! This delves into the porn industry in a very sensitive way-it will not offend anyone. It also tells ways to help those addicted. The ending will definitely surprise you and left me feeling sad for one of the characters, but not the murderer!",1
Bought this gauge half way worked. It would freeze and then drop real fast. I turned key off and back on and it would show different readings. The sender was good. I bought a sierra and works like a charm.,0
Great product! Easy to install and stays where you put it. Protects the leather seats from scratches from my two dogs. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's a few inches short of covering the entire rear seat in my full size crew cab pickup. I'd definitely pay a few dollars more for an extra large size. Should be no problem in most cars!,1
The belt shown in the picture is the color I was expecting. The belt arrived and is much darker. Disappointing as I was trying to match sandals that are exactly what the picture is.,0
This item is terrible for pregnant woman! Poorly designed! Poor quality! The straps just keep popping off and it’s even big on me. When I adjust it nothing changes. Do not buy.,0
Just received today but very satisfied.,1
He's a coonhound and has a very active brain. I use cheez whiz or peanut butter for him. It keeps him thinking so he doesn't become bored and destructive. I have two for him.,1
Extremely inaccurate readings even after soil calibration. Takes 90 seconds between each reading and there is no way to manually poll the probe to make the process quicker. Very basic and ugly user interface that makes the entire experience painful.,0
Added so much to the projects! Works well.,0
"Amazing! It doesn't bleed through, the colours are really cute even though the pink isn't quite as light as I wanted, but still perfectly functional",1
Thank you funko for creating a Latin America Icon. I am a collector and this has more of a sentimental value than anything else. Family Memories.,1
"Well made, baby loves it",1
Had problems with one of the ink supplies but rep sent me a replacement quickly and without hassle. Good customer service!,1
Looked great and very solid....held up to my southern-in-laws' dense potato salad.,1
I like it all. It is well written and adds much to humanity in its effort to free itself from racism!,1
this item is very poor made. the USB port i would have to wiggle it to get it work randomly. but once i do the power isn't consistent.,0
"Very thin material, not very high-quality I guess you get what you pay for.",0
My grandkids (age 3 & 4) loved them.,1
"Pretty thin, weak chair. Not really much good to say about it. It's cheap enough but if you're looking for something super sturdy, keep looking.",0
Just didn't like the setup and action of this bingo game,0
Does hold as many wipes as I would like.,0
"The photos of this product show the first edition version. When I received this book, it was the much later, differently-covered version. This made it impossible for me to use it to replace the first edition version that I accidentally destroyed at the beach. (Life lesson: do not read comics at the beach.) Fortunately, when I confessed to its original owner about what happened, he was forgiving, and accepted the lesser book.",0
Great product will recomend,1
These do NOT work. All you hear is static. No music comes through at all!!,0
"Lost my old one for my Flex 4, so bought this one instead. Of course the day this arrives, I find the old one. *rolls eyes* Anyway, now I have a spare, I guess. It works fine.",1
I did not like them they are too heavy they are too noisy,0
"My goodness, my poor armpit, pinched my skin so bad . I really don’t like this electric razor , I go over one area for so many times just for one piece of hair .",0
Phone was delivered. Speaker full of junk. Plugged in and gave plenty of time to charge to 100% unplugged it and was at 5% in less than 10 min not even in use,0
"I am on my third UE Boom. I have a background in digital film making and sound editing. I handle my equipment with care. No drops, no spilling, no kicking around. Nevertheless, all of my 3 Ultimate Ears booms lasted only for about 1 year, not even that. They look cool, but always same story: Without any apparent reason, from one day to another, they stop working properly and instead put out tinny, clanking, and weak sound. Sometimes it helps, when Bluetooth gets rebooted. I am done with this brand. Don't know what the quality issues are, given thousands of great reviews. Either, they are selling counterfeits here on Amazon, which I happened to get, or the speakers are really built not to be durable.",0
"This product exceeded my expectations. I am not good about cleaning my make up brushes. In fact when I received this cleaner it had been months since I last cleaned them. So I figured at best they should be a little better off. It was better than that! My brushes are like new! A couple I needed to clean two times, but considering how much build up on them there was, was completely warranted. I’m so excited that I discovered this product as I finally have a reason to buy nicer brushes! Clean up was easy!",1
This movie is dreadful. I usually don't write reviews after watching movies but this one inspired me to hopefully deter anyone wanting to watch it from wasting their time. No stars!,0
Great product. Exactly as advertised. Highly recommend.,1
"So disappointed with Amazon! I ordered this Bug Joe chair for my daughters dorm room, all my daughter received was a plain plastic bag of refill beans! Call to fix it and found out the item is no longer in stock. I did get a refund but still really dissappinted.",0
"The bags are extremely durable and hold their vacuum well in the freezer, which is what I really bought them for. I had some problems evacuating some of the bags and contacted the seller who was extremely helpful. Since it appeared that the pump was at fault, he replaced not only the pump, but the whole kit, bags and all",1
"This plastic filter wrench is too soft, it could not hold the extension, the extension kept spinning around in the head of the wrench, I had to use a one inch socket on the outer end to remove the oil filter, but even this part was too soft. It won't last long, maybe one or two more use and it will Ibe worn out. It should have been made of metal.",0
Little girls underwhelmed by the neutral colors; over time polish got thin and didn’t cover well,0
works great can hear a difference after the 2nd day,1
"I was so excited about this...arrived packed well and then it broke in two seperate very important places in the first month! I think the plastic its made of us simply low quality, sucks too because its such a huge piece of plastic to be wasting now and it had a cool stabilizer and the feet were solid 🙁",0
"Difficult to open/close, but good for freezer stuff like fruit.",1
This is a great product Ive used for 20 years. It’s not for those who are sensitive to rough wash cloths. This product is great for exfoliating leaving you with clean-feeling skin.,1
"Worked without a hitch right out of the box. Didn’t have any issues. If it continues to function, it’s a great buy...cheaper than the iDevice I have...",1
Quality is great for the price. Installation is easy !,1
"Took too long to ship, and assembly instructions were unclear and a poor photo copy so pictures couldn't be used either. Once assembled, they barely spin, only in high(er) winds. Not at all satisfied.",0
"I never received this item. Other items delivered on Oct 19th were placed on door step, in excellent condition. I was hoping the product was just lagging behind. I was hoping to receive the pads before my training exercise scheduled for Nov 3rd. I need to resolve this issue. If I need to reorder the item, I need to know is ASAP. Thank you. Ray Solis.",0
Nice looking glasses. I bought them for my father in-law. But they were too wide for his face. I wish they would have been smaller (narrower from side edge to side edge).,1
"I just finished this book today. I have to admit, the further I got into this book, the more it kept me engaged. I am not sure who the target reader is for this book, as there are many who could find something worthwhile in it, but it makes sense that it is in the Contemporary fiction genre. It is true to life and very realistic. The character of Swain becomes more likable as the story moves on. With each chapter, the drama of Swain's recent life, the divorce, and the loss of his daughter all unfold. I felt for him in his losses and in his joys that he feared to embrace for so long. The Jones character seems to simply exist as a foil to Swain's character; he is the jerk of a friend that one just can't let go of. The details of living in Hong Kong and the ups and downs of living on a boat were pretty interesting. I saw some areas that could use another edit, but other than that the writing was well-done, the vocabulary was vivid, and the story was engaging.",1
Classic movie featuring Bette Midler. I saw this movie years ago and was great to revisit this on DVD. Fun to share with people who haven't seen this movie.,1
Great for flat nipples. Helps to transition to breastfeeding.,1
Your guy do good job,0
Beautifully written. Missing deeper understanding of motivations and objectives. Characters suffer from existential floating. But that may be common to terrorist acts.,1
Broken when it arrived. I was able to basically tape it together as it was the handle but it just doesn't work well,0
I have not yet got my order!!!,0
"Awesome snorkel set! First set I bought that didn’t take water in the mouth piece when diving down and breaking the surface again. Fin is nice and stiff, goggles and mouth piece very comfortable. One thing to note: sizes run large/wide. I am women’s size 7/8 so I bought the S/M. It was wider and larger than I would prefer, so I had to tighten the strap all the way, but did not have problems with the fin slipping off.",1
This mouse or its cord died just as the 1-year warranty expired.I would give it NO stars but do not have that option. Hate is a strong word (1 star) but I definitely don't recommend this product.,0
"This was a very enjoyable read for me as a kid growing up watching the classics. Although there were some parts of the movie i didn't enjoy, my overall opinion of this movie is still high.",1
Fun book! For all ages,1
"Like the ease of clock to use with my project. Dislike I had to get special batteries /carbon bs alkaline. It wasn’t that easy to get hands put on, And metal bent easily.",1
I ordered this for Ps4 (it says on the order ps4 and everything) but received an Xbox one copy. I'm trying to figure out how to return or exchange it now.,0
"Very disappointed. Worked at first. Now, after three months does not work. Cannot recommend.",0
"Learned the hard way not to skimp and buy remanufactured ink carts. Got the carts and installed the black one, which was what I needed. Immediately my printer got super clogged and went from printing fine to printing 1” stripes across the paper. No amount of head cleaning and alignment would fix the problem. I ended up throwing the printer away and buying the newer model which was on sale. $50 for the new printer plus the cost of this horrible ink makes for an expensive lesson.",0
I have chronic knee pains due to arthritis. I gave this product I try but am not happy with it. It even made my knees fire up in pain. Im going back to the other brand its a bit pricey but really works,0
I returned these cards. Featured in the card was a website for encouragement. I couldn’t get the website,0
Works great 2 applications a week apart and fungus is gone.,1
"Perfect, came with everything needed. God quality and fit perfectly. Much less then original brand.",1
Wore these for the first time today. Had to come home and soak my feet in Epsom salt water. Were ok for about an hour. Did not provide much cushion. I'm a high school administrator and walk a lot on tile floors. I really needed these to work.,0
"This sweatshirt changed my life. I wore this sweatshirt almost every single day from January 25th, 2017 up until last week or so when the hood fell off after almost a year of abuse. This sweatshirt has made me realize that the small things in life are the things that matter. Thank you Hanes, keep doing what you do. Love, Justin",1
I highly recommend it.,1
"Very cute, nice quality",1
Minor inconsistencies but perfect for my use,1
"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",1
"This book is like a footnote guide to things you already know.... It rings of truth but barely glances over every subject with 6-8 page chapters in a larger print. I guess it is great for bathroom reading... Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the depth of the subject matter left something lacking.",0
Pretty good case I like that it has some grip to it,1
"I love this board can be mounted with just a few thumb tacks. There are no major holes left in the wall. It comes with all the tacks needed and 4 colors of erase markers. It rolls up, which is portable and nice. I run a home based business, the daily calendar has ceased marital debates about the schedule. I wish I had found this 4 years ago. Also if you live in an apartment, the Property Manager will appreciate the very small footprint it leaves. Thank you!!",1
LOVE these socks! So comfy and soft and you CAN NOT feel the seams! Ordered 5 pack and same day I got them and tried them on I ordered another 5 pack!,1
"pros: -softest fabric ever, wow, so warm!!! -cutest design -fits p well round the body! cons: -short on the legs, even with having it fit a lot lower -buttons spread apart, so it can be a little chilly outside overall, rlly awesome!!!! bought for a costume to hand out candy 4 kids!",1
I liked the characters and the developing relationships. The suspense and uncertainty in the plot kept me reading.,1
"This case looks nice and gives the phone a bit of grip, which makes it less likely to slip off from slick surfaces, but it ripped within a couple weeks of having it on my phone.",0
"But I couldn't. Perhaps my torso is too long, but the open cups were made waaaaay too large and the torso was not long enough. This caused a super weird gap between my breasts and beneath the open cups. I love the material, but it just did not fit right.",0
Just got these in today. I was a bit hesitant to get these but they are well worth it especially at the price they're at. The sound quality is fantastic. They sound like they're plugged directly into your phone.,1
"The directions make no sense, could not even put it together as all of the parts did not come with it either",0
Arrived quickly and in sturdy package. The palm rest is perfect and was a breeze to install. The touchpad was easy as well but honestly it is a little too thick for those who use it exclusively. All together it is a solid product.,1
"There's an education problem in America, yes, but no shortage of STEM educated. I find this a red herring, and, more importantly, does not offer solutions since it's barking up the wrong tree. The fact that this author is anonymous speaks to the issue: the all too powerful industry, who're after US' elite entitlement: indentured labor.",0
Very comfortable shoes.,1
They are soft sheets. I only bought them for the cooling feature. They do NOT cool at all!!!! Do not buy for this feature.,0
"Good story, but a bit too short. Just when I was getting into it, the story wrapped in a paragraph!",1
Placed it on my phone and was unsticking...plastic material.,0
I wish there were 2.0 version with a large canister. This only holds about 12oz coffee so it’s. It really enough to make a large one. It’s only good for one use at a time before it needs refreshing. I’ve tried to fill it 2 times in a row and the second pour was extremely watery because the inside had melted and poured out the air vents on the lid,0
Work great. I make 5 lbs of butter a week. Wish they were a little longer,1
"If I could give it a zero I would. It’s a piece of thin cotton fabric with a string attached. It is cheap, but still a waste of a few dollars. The picture is NOT the product you get.",0
The digital reader would not work when I took it out of the box. So now I've wasted quite a bit of money. Tried to contact seller and no response.,0
Coasters worked out well.,1
This really works makes you Eat less. Drink lots of water with it.,0
I have had these pads on for about a month. Works as expected.,1
I have not received it. I ordered quite sometime ago. Hopefully I will get it.,0
"Very disappointed! The information was very misleading by giving the customer the assumption they were buying more than one product for the outrageous high price and the metallic instrument was very cheap for that price. When I spoke to an Amazon personnel they also believed the product came as an assortment of 12. When I received the 1 product, it was damaged by being cracked and discolored. I have now returned it waiting for my refund.",0
THIS IS A TRUSTWORTHY COMPANY THAT STANDS BEHIND ITS PRODUCT. BUT IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL HOW IT WORKS WITH THIS NEW HP 'STUDENT PRINTER' THAT STILL HAS ITS ORIGINAL INK CARTRIDGES.,1
"This dress is very comfortable. I love the color and the fit. In cooler months I can wear it with leggings, boots, and a sweater.",1
These mailers are very nice and classy looking. Definitely gives a VIP feel to my products.,1
"Basic ""wiffle"" balls often crack in half when struck by a baseball bat several times, but these stand up to some pretty hard punishment. They are also a bit cheaper than some other similar training balls the market. Shipping was prompt. I recommend this product and seller.",1
Never got mine in the mail now that I’m seeing this! Wow. I’d like a full refund !,0
The charge will not stay working. After about 10 seconds it stops charging,0
"I have a Moto Z Force. The audio works great and I can control volume and pause/mute from my headset. But, the charger port does not work on either adapter in the two-pack. Could have bought better. Returned. Most, if not all, of the 5 star ratings are fake. You can tell by seeing what other things they have rated on their profiles. Many of them are the same products rated on the same days. Clearly fake.",0
"It worked only for a little over a month and died. Fortunately, we bought protection plan and exchanged it for free. Hoping the next one is not defective.",0
"This pan is amazing. I love the size and the nonstick coating. The lid sits nicely. It is perfect for so many things. We love it for a breakfast skillet and mix hashbrowns, eggs, onions, green peppers and bacon or ham for a one skillet breakfast. Clean up is a cinch.",1
"This is not the product I purchased, my order was for PERSIAN RED however I receiver a RED color which is a different color and with a different tone",0
"I just received the package and even with the box beaten up the ink was contained within the cartridges and not all over them like some of the other reviews. I have run a test print and it looks great! If the ink lasts almost or as long as the HP ones, these are a no brainer for the price!",1
very nice but I expected it to be a little larger. It is a good size for a table top sign though.,1
My 10 pound dog shredded the rings within a week of purchasing.,0
"Product delivery speed is very fast, very bright with the quality of goods, bang bang weight is also very heavy, and the installation is simple, stable, are used in real materials, some problems are not easy to find, for a period of time after the use of additional comments from you, thank you",1
"Very bright, long distance beam. Not the best design connecting handle to main body. Very top heavy and feels like it may eventually break. Thus far it works great.",1
This stopped working adter a minth. Would not recommend at all.,0
Plush well done but a little too small,1
Grand daughter likes it because it is nice and thin,1
"I found this stable and very helpful to get things off the floor, as well as to be able to store below and on top of. Nice that it's adjustable.",1
I installed this on my Whirlpool washer and it worked as expected,1
It screws securely but it turns color rather quickly. Can’t use these,0
Did absolutely nothing for me at all,0
"I wanted to like this movie because of the important and meaningful context of child abduction, but I couldn't watch the whole thing, I had to start skipping parts due to the main character not being likable, lots of flash editing transitions that you can do in imovie, and just drawn out redundant scenes. If you want to watch an unforgettable similar movie, try ""Dearest"" - best child abduction and Chinese movie I've seen..",0
"Great quality , works perfect",1
These switches are awesome I've installed both of them and they work as expected I only wish they had a day-night on them,1
This album is the best I have heard in years. Highly Recommend,1
"Used this bookbag for 3 semesters loves it. Super cute had a lot of compliments on it. Finally one of the magnet latches broke off, but it sure did go through some abuse for the past year and a half.",1
I was actually blown away by the quality of this costume...the little girl it was purchased for loved it!,1
"Someone said it works on the bottle from Costco, but mine's didn't work. It didn't fit completely and the water leaked. I will return it.",0
I have had these on for 3 days and already have condensation. I think the seals are defective but waiting for the seller to contact me.,0
Delivery was fast all 8 seem to well made,1
Could never get the bowl filled to the proper level.,0
I did not receive this item.,0
This is the best for finicky cats. Most of ours will eat this one,1
Exactly what I expected. They do the job.,1
"Design is nice, but it broke already the day after I put it up.",0
"Runs a bit small, but still fit okay. The headband could be made more toddler friendly. My daughter did not like the hard plastic headband. Overall adorable costume though!",1
"It’s disappointing opening the box getting excited to see your package arrive, only to find that only 4 sets were delivered not the 6 you were promised.",0
"We didn't expect the light to change colors, but it made for a fun joke with friends. The light it very bright and attracts plenty of attention at dark. However the first light only lasted one month, almost exactly.",0
"I thought the picture was great, until I noticed the banding issue getting worse. Then I realized 4K sometimes looks worse because of this. Then there is the audio. No matter what devise I plug into, there is an audible static whenever sound is being played. It reminds me of those old sound clips for AOL Instant Messenger. Will be returning this. Was a shame, I waited minths for this to TV to come out.",0
One of the bulbs arrived broken,0
"Bought this for my wife and she likes it. So far, it has held up well but then she does not use her cell phone like I do.",1
"Mount works great. Only down fall is that the TV is tight to the wall, if plugs/inputs are on the backside of TV, you will need to add spacer to the mount to push it away from the wall.",1
Very good for a reasonable price!,1
order this just open it up and theirs scratches on every peace and there are missing parts as i show you in the photos i want my money back.... I ORDER THIS PRODUCT BRAN NEW NOT USED WITH MISSING PARTS ... BOX WAS DAMAGED AS WELL this review is for the proof for amazon to review issue my money back !!!,0
Bought it to put in the cabinet to store my platters. Works perfectly for that purpose,1
"A perfect find Beautiful perfect great, Awesome cord!!! These cords are great.",1
"Tastes great, hope it works.",1
I enjoyed this book and plan to read it to our 2nd grade class.,1
Well since I'm sitting here watching Christmas programs this morning I might as well give this product review do not buy I repeat do not buy the first three days one of them fell apart on the 7th Day the second one fell apart I'm sorry for the bad review but I call them as I see them I will not buy any of these again for those of you just reading this I strongly suggest that you get the one that is the screw-in not the bayonet it totally sucks,0
This product takes forever to get the wrinkles out of your clothes and you have to keep filling it up with water. It's really annoying to have to keep running to the sink to refill it. It is a more ideal for removing wrinkles for maybe like one clothing item. I like to remove the wrinkles out of my clothes after doing laundry and I usually have a couple clothing items and I cannot efficiently get it done with this product.,0
Very good product I realy love it,1
"I have to return. Although my corning ware casserole is marked 2 1/2 quarts, this top does not fit...it is too small. Will investigate further to see if I can get the lid that will fit.",0
"We used these for the first time this past week, as hoped they were much better than a traditional snorkel set. We we were able to breath normally, see clearly and no water got into the mask. We did have an issue getting the mask snug at first (and the enclosed directions were not very helpful) but we were able to figure it out .",1
I love that they stick to my shoe even after i remove and reset a few times. I have been going to physio therapy for my heel pain and it helps for a few days that gradually returns. She recommended arch supports and I am wowed. I did not expect such fast relief. They pack of six was perfect for 3 shoes that I wear most. I am feeling so much better.,1
"Tried to pair new Kenwood radio with iPhone, android and couldn't get it to work. Tried to use it with Mac Pro laptop and it would not work. I sent the first one back, no luck with the second. I had to return it also. Seller claims it was the fault of my ""car computer."" No help at all.",0
Cute 5 year old loved her...,1
"It does not crimp well. I tried different crimping tools, all had the same results.",0
Very disappointed. I thought that this coolers were going to stay cooler longer because of the gel but it really doesn’t make a difference with the ones that are filled with water. This ones melt within a few hours inside of an insulated lunch bag. Also the yellow one bursted with it first use. I did check if it was water and definitely is gel. The colors are not as bright as the picture shows. Honestly I do not recommend this coolers for the price!,0
Please note if you put these covers on you cant close your charging case and the phone will not charge,0
"This has to be one of the nicest mandolin's I have owned. Not only does it have every attachment, but it's easy to use and the blades stay fairly sharp for a while. It is easy to clean and stows away nicely.",1
"I specifically wanted socks that did not have the ""non skid"" bottoms because my child loves to run and slide across the floor lol these fit perfectly, are soft, & seem to be good quality! I'm happy with the purchase",1
"Decent features for the price, but it locks up about once a month, making it pretty useless.",0
The product came in time for the birthday party. He liked it and said it works great and gives him the back support that his office chair doesn't,1
I ordered the extra large and they are very tight and I am not that big. I am under 6 ft and weight 155 lbs,0
I bought this book but it was never delivered even though it says it was. I'm unable to get my money back from Amazon.,0
Little bit other types noise,1
"Not the waves I was expecting. Oh well, it was only $10.",0
"Ankle was injured while running. Bought this to aid in healing faster (R.I.C.E.). I’d recommend placing the ice packs in the brace & freezing because if you freeze prior, it becomes tricky to place them in the pockets. It is comfortable to wear vs. consistently bandaging/compressing the injury.",1
Kept my hubby & son warm and comfortable during snow activities. True to size & snug fit; will definitely buy again.,1
"Wide at the top, tight around the hips. It looks weird and unflattering!",0
I was going to use these beautiful earrings for my cosplay of Elizabeth. Unfortunately These only lasted about 10 minutes...Drawn on with sharpie huh? Yeah don't think I didn't notice. The marks and patterns erased I was very disappointed because I did not even get to do this cosplay. I would never recommend this (PLEASE DONT BUY),0
Very drying on my hair .,0
Great read! I bought the book on my kindle on Thursday and by Sunday I was finished. The book was great.,1
The butterfly was flat and bigger than the picture,0
Wonderful and stylish. Protects my laptop during the commute. If you need to take alot of things along with you this may not be for you. I am a minimalist when it comes to what I have to lug around so this case serves its purpose beautifully,1
A co-worker suggested I try this product. I was looking for something to have at work. The taste is pretty good. Blending takes some time. At home I put it in the blender. Otherwise you need to have a shaker bottle or stir a long time. For creating ketones and staying in Ketosis it is worth a try.,1
"Alexa, and I thought it didn't work any more... Da, power button...",1
I bought this Handle pull as I had some already but needed some more and found them on Amazon. I am very pleased with the handle Pull as they are exactly like the ones I already had. They are very sturdy and very stylish as well. The price was just what I was looking for. I would buy them again if I happen to need more. Great service and very prompt arrival. And yes I would recommend to my friends to buy them.,1
"I liked it okay while it lasted... I really loved this case when I bought it. However it cracked & leaked out. In addition, the lip needs to be a little bit bigger around the edge of the phone. I’ve gone through MANY, MANY Bodyguardz screen protectors with this case.",0
I have used the full contents and have not seen any true changes in my feet. I am diabetic and do have diabetic problems that this product was not effective on.,0
"As soon as I got it, I put it together ( the handle portion of it. Washed it with soap and water or course. and diced my tomatoes, onions, cilantro, chiles. the only thing I did not diced was my garlic. With that said I made salsa in about fifteen minutes, which it would have taken me an hour or so to hand dice everything. and the amount that I did was a substantial amount. I love it and I even took a picture of my dicer and the salsa that I made and I had 23 responses indicating that the salsa looked great and where did I get the dicer. Love it and will use it quite often",1
"The convenience of this pool cover is great, as it clamps conveniently to each leg of the frame. However, upon opening my pool this year, I noticed tears in various spots on the cover. It only went through one season! You would think the manufacturer understands that this Intex, 18' above ground pool is made for outdoor use, and the cover needs to have the same resistance to weather. I live in southern California, but the pool cover is tearing before being hit by the summer heat. It's only May! Color me very disappointed!",0
Love this coverup! It’s super thin and very boho!! Always getting compliments on it!,1
Does not suck well at all. Pieces broke that I had to glue.,0
They are so comfortable that I don't even know I am wearing them.,1
Our cat loves this cat scratcher. Perfect shape and size.,1
"Helped me a lot with my neck pain, the battery lasts forever and it is ok to hold, as heavy as all the other models.",1
Worked for about 2 months then stuck wide open destroying my pump,0
"These wireless, bluetooth headphones mostly deliver as advertised. They are very lightweight, the sound quality is on par for what I'd expect, the battery life gets close to 3 hours, and I really like the idea of carrying case, although it would be even better if the top of it stayed attached when you open them. The hardest part for me was understanding how to get both of them to play music simultaneously. Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears! I'll add that one other nice feature is having a separate charging cord that goes straight into the earbuds. With certain competition, the earbuds need their charging case or they can't charge, so kudos on the design here.",1
I have had to use these a lot recently even though they were purchased for camping. They are easy to use and work great in all the rooms needed in.,1
Bracket that holds handing files broke in less than 60 days of lights use!,0
my 8 months old enjoys playing with this toy,1
"I had a set like this before until I broke one , so I ordered an extra one . They are exactly as advertised , not to small and not to big and easy to use",1
"Flashlight is lightweight and relatively flimsy. Bought for occasional use around the house and emergency use in case of power outage since I already have two 19.2 batteries for my drills. Have only used one of the lights a few times and the bulb burnt out, maybe had 30 minutes total use. I didn't drop the light or abuse it so was pretty surprised by the short life of the bulb. Went on Amazon to buy replacement bulbs and found the reviews to be poor and that these bulbs routinely burn out quickly. Certainly wouldn't buy Craftsman bulbs - very expensive. Will buy an off-brand bulb at $1 a bulb or an LED replacement if it has good reviews.",0
For my son worked great,1
"... the necklace will not lay flat. I still wear it occasionally, but that really bugs me",0
Just as advertised. Quick shipping.,1
"This is THE BEST mascara I have found. I live in south Florida and this stays on through humidity, rain, everything and NO clumping or smudging. It's buildable and really easy to remove. LOVE IT!",1
I suggest not ordering these if you plan on using them as motorcycle gloves. This is not the intended use......,0
"Disappointing lock quality. One of the keys only works on 3 locks, and the other key on 3 locks. So if you want to be able to open all the locks you have to carry both keys. The lock mechanism seems to be loose in the lock body as well.",0
It genuinely makes your teeth white and is natural so would highly recommend this to anyone looking for natural whitener!,1
"So the dress looks lovely right out of the bag. I’m sure if you have super toned I try bitty skinny arms it would be perfect. But I wasn’t expecting tony arm holes on a big girl size. Like biting into your armpit, someone chop my arms off or cut me out kind of small. Didn’t work for me even when I ordered another size.",0
"Very fun game at first but after playing for three or four days, the game crashed and I completely lost all my save data. So all that time went straight out and I lost everything Very disappointing.",0
Works good kinda thick but if they aren’t cold they will work fine,1
This is a poorly made piece that was falling apart as we assembled it - some of the elements looked closer to cardboard than any wood you can imagine. I can foresee that it will be donated or thrown away in the next few months or even weeks.,0
I bought this for my german shepherd. It's been great. It was much gentler than a standard collar when he was learning to walk on a leash.,1
"when I call the other person couldn’t Hear me, sound quality is 8/10 compare to apple 10/10. I would say this is only good for 2 hours of listening to music other then that you can’t do anything else, can’t call or use for a long time. It only $10 so Can’t compared to apple $160",0
I use these to mail small products I sell love them!,1
"I owned one of these before, intimately familiar with it. This unit has defect in the roller wheel that snags up and stops. The top doesn't snap open like my previous not either. That's where knockoffs can be seen - in the tiniest important details.",0
The product is of very poor quality broke just after few uses,0
I love these! Highly recommend! They have kept my feet soft and I usually have quite hard and calloused bottoms!,1
"Got the package on time. But the seeds look nothing like American Paw Paws, so I think I got shafted for a few bucks. Won't be doing this again. Better to buy Paw Paws in the USA.",0
Cheap halogen bulbs that do not come in individual packages. 1 blew out after a day - you get what you pay for! Would not recommend.,0
This case is great but there is plastic that goes over the buttons on the side of the iPhone and it is very hard to use them through the plastic. Would be so much better if it was a cutout so you could easily use the phone features. The case itself it nice but wouldn’t recommend as it makes the phone harder to use.,0
Great material and condition but the medical tag part keeps opening and I lost all my contact information that was in there the very first day. The clip alone is not very strong.,0
Very pleased so far.,1
I was looking forward to being able to change the color of the light but unfortunately that function is not available. The light was however easy to connect to Alexa and is nice not having to require a hub. Now that I’ve had these a few weeks it really bothers me that they are not as advertised. I thought I would get used to the color but the longer I have them the more it irritates me. I’m going to have to look for another brand.,0
Good quality. Used for craft project,1
Please don't buy this product 1. My ear plug doesn't work 2. The battery power only increase 25%,0
I thought the key portion was detachable like the one I bought a few years ago. I had to buy one that didn't have the key.,0
"The movie was better. It happens that way, sometimes.",0
"Love these lamps! They have a small foot print on my night stand, the charger works good, they take standard size bulbs, and the design is classy and simple, we bought 2 for or bedroom.",1
"Works very well. Easy to set alarms, and time. The snooze/backlight function is pretty neat too. The dim back light is also nice so that you can actually read the time in the dark.",1
Sticky but not dried out so easily peeled off. Not recommend.,0
Wouldn’t buy this. Half of the chargers in the 5 pack don’t work.,0
This will be perfect for hauling my photography backdrop stands and props. The zipper and canvas are a nice quality and heavy duty. Plenty of space.,1
"This works in very cold temperatures. I have it out in my garage. When I leave it on overnight in the winter, by the morning its still running, but the bin is almost full, and it is a solid block of ice. I thaw out the bin, dump it, put it back in and it starts refilling again",1
It's a thick cover...seems like durable material. The reason why I don't like is that you couldn't cover the oven while it was attached to the 5# gas tank. The elastic cord would not expand enough. So with nothing attached to the oven it would probably be great but for my purposes I didn't like and couldn't use.,0
Not anough coverage across the chest. My tits hang out,0
I bought these for my 3 yr old grandson. The minute he saw the box his eyes lit up. They fit perfectly. He can put them on himself which makes him feel like a big boy. They arrived very quickly and I couldn’t be more pleased!,1
"The lid does not stay open, have to hold it open to remove drone and controller, makes it annoying",0
Good Quality and compact.,1
It was recommended by a friend and found that things are really good to wear and I like them very much.,1
"I have wear this shoes for few months now. I like it in the bingeing until all the little plastics rubble falling apart, now I have to pick up the small rubble pieces all day long. I have a picture of how it look, not recommend!",0
"I didn’t think this could work on my triple helix ear piercings, but I have to say, it does. I had been using sterile saline spray, and it seemed to be getting puffier and more irritated rather than better. I’ve only been using this for a couple of days, and it already feels and looks much better. Much less puffy and irritated. Pretty pricey, but worth it, I think.",1
"Hi, I lost my AirPod case so I bought this one, and now my AirPods won’t sync to my phone? How do i get this to work?",0
Arrived broken. Son was not happy at all,0
For some reason the sound keeps cutting out on the DVD..it's getting really frustrating and I don't think it's caused by my computer. Wanted to know if others were having this problem as well.,0
Good band for the money. Looks good but a little cheap in quality,1
"After searching for some comfortable office shoes for awhile I came across this one. I was hesitant to purchase but it looked like it would work. The first few days weren’t that comfortable because i was still breaking into the shoes. I got a blister the first few days. However, once I finally broke into the shoes I would definitely say it was worth the price. It’s comfortable when walking for a long time, looks well with most of my office outfits and very light! I have enjoyed these shoes thus far.",1
Sitting in an office all day I needed extra support. The strap on this doesn’t secure to the chair like you would need in order to use this how you’d expect to. I had to use a giant rubber band around the top half to keep it from tipping out/forward all the time.,0
they sent the wrong size but its cheaply made and not worth it.,0
"Bought these to use on the beach. They're nice for drinks and help keep them studier. However, they don't work for snacks because they're so low to the ground that there's no way that sand doesn't get kicked into them. I think they'd be useful for drinks for almost any outdoor venue to give a little extra spill protection, although they'll only work on a fairly flat surface. The plastic is quite thick and hard, so they seem very durable.",1
"I like this punch bought it for a friend and decided to get one for myself. It’s a pretty punch, it does stick at times, if dropped it hasn’t fallen apart yet, I think it’s sturdy. Works well on paper.",1
case is kinda hard to put on and off and even with the protective plastic case over my phones screen it still lets dust and dirt in. often i'm on my phone and there's a little spot i try to wipe away only to realize it's under the plastic coating. feels like i'm constantly pulling the case apart to clean the phone. the only reason its getting 2 stars is because so far i've dropped my phone like 10 times and it seems to hold and protect just fine.,0
"Love the product overall, the only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the way it’s packaged. It makes it difficult to unravel because you have to be careful not to have the ornaments fall off, and one did but its fine",1
"We ordered these because of 3 main features 1. photoelectric, 2. smoke and CO, 3 battery operated. Upon receipt it doesn't' say photoelectric anywhere. I honest to god just put out a neighbors fire last weekend and it was the early detection of photoelectric that saved his home. The alarm went off at the smoldering stage and he wasn't home but we heard the alarm, we busted in and saved the place with a large fire extinguisher. I will not chance using a detector that is not clearly photoelectric, so we immediately returned it, so not able to comment on effectiveness. Can't take the risk.",0
Not durable. Our 5 year old son bit off almost all of the spikes on a ring within the first two days and he was only holding it from time to time.,0
The plant arrived frozen and as a result it is half dead. I did not carefully read the return policy and an unable to return the fern which is unfortunate.,0
My 2-year old grandson loves this series. Pictures are great; nice sturdy board book that is easy for him to use. He asks for this book to be read over and over.,1
The pump does not work.,0
"I really like the look of this band, but there's one thing: when I'm wearing it, if the watch is centered on the top of my wrist, the buckle isn't centered on the bottom. It's almost as if the buckle portion of the band is slightly shorter than ""normal"" and the part with the holes is slightly longer (see image). On the whole I'm happy with it, but this quirk is distracting.",1
"Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.",0
They didn't even do thier job right and the screw not all the way in and now I'm fighting with them to get one different cuz its only one but I need to send both back but can't my old ones where broke,0
"It’s beautiful than I expected. Hopefully the magnetic therapy works too. I have only wore it for a couple of days, so it’s too early to say.",1
"First of all, there are NOT 24 cans - there are only 8. Secondly, the paints do NOT glow in the dark, even after leaving them in the sun for days. Waste of money. Don't bother.",0
"It’s a nice squishy and looks like my mom’s favorite bread so that was a win, but it didn’t smell like pineapple at all. It had more of a chemical smell to it which isn’t good. I didn’t get it for the smell but it is a bit off putting and I’m sure it’ll fade in time.",1
"Very thin, size small the arms are short.",0
"I would have given 5 stars if they didn’t frey, but super soft and great for my little newborn. I will be buying more",1
These make it really easy to use your small keyboard on your phone. Would recommend to everyone.,1
This does not work at all. I plugged it in and left it. My electric bill is higher this month.,0
Love you Guys.....BUT don't sent a phoney tried to deliver message because you can't deliver on the date promised. It would have been no big deal! Dont appreciate the fooling around.,1
"We loved the look and for a couple of days it worked, but was it.",0
Fits good ... weird material though,0
This clock kept gaining time do not buy!!,0
"Mr. Oldman has played and created many, different characters. It is very difficult to tell it is him. He and Johnny Depp are amazing actors. Regarding his portrayal of Churchill, was very well done. The compressed time frame from May 10 to the 26th was well presented with the clock 7 turning pages... The scenery and costumes were excellent. Is poignant with today's pair of demi-gods holding world political position. Worth a look several times...worth thoughtful rumination... many more times",1
Does not fit well on all large breed dogs. Cheaply made and broke very easily. The product didn’t hold up longer than 2 months for both a small boxer and a extra large king shepherd dog.,0
Very cute and squishy. The heads rip easily but they are fun to play with.,1
"S.M. Pratt, I really enjoyed this book. It is different and sexy as all. Cannot wait to start the next chapter. The characters are immensely sexy and this take on writing this genre is refreshing. Wish I could meet a pilot like that! YUMM.",1
"Pretty easy to work with, the finished driveway looks very nice have to see over time how it lasts , Happy with the results .",1
"Would not recommend. The bits are poorly made. It isn't a big deal on the philips and other bits that don't need percision, but the holes and lobes of some of the security bits are off enough where I don't think I could use them.",0
Did not like the quality. Had a spongy back so that makes it hard to remove.,0
"I had high expectations about this product and it was supposed to be a present to my mother. What a disappointment! It never worked, I waisted my money for nothing.",0
"Not one size, if yuo have a large head it is a little tight.",1
A lil too brief but I still liked it,1
Wish they came with a paper tube in the middle rather than the thin stick for tapping down the insides. Love the tube.,1
"I had pink hair, I was taking the color out with vitamin c tablets and dandruff shampoo but I heard this product would help me take out the color better. HORRIBLE MISTAKE. I left it on for 20 minutes and when I checked it, it was gray/light blue. I have no idea how it could possibly turn this color if I had no type of blue tones in my hair only pink and reds.. I'm devistated by the outcome of my hair.",0
I see a lot of people have these. They are a cute decoration but pretty cheap.,0
"I just have purchased this food grade calcium bentonite clay for my face masks. I love this thing, always works great for my skin, you can also mix it with essential oils to make a more beneficial mask. it's a very fine sifted bentonite clay which is awesome, makes it easier to make a mask.",1
Super Cute and very quiet!!!!!,1
Not bad for the price,1
Great selection of interesting toys. Cat loves it.,1
I ALSO BOUGHT THE REQUIRED CABLE. I DID BUILD MY OWN MOUNTING POLE IT WORKS GREAT,1
"Nice goggles, clear vision and easy to fit.",1
"Cutest sunglasses, I get lots of compliments. The stripe feature is so darling and the price was too good to pass up.",1
Works as advertised. Very satisfied.,1
"Okay, to be fair I am a monkey when it comes to things like this and it is why I ordered a two pack. The first one was practice! I made it work on try two, so people with better skills than I should be just fine with the product. I penalized the product one star as I saw one at the phone store with a jig for aligning the protection screen. It would probably only take me one if I had one less thing to worry about! All in all happy with the price and it works well.",1
"This is a great toiletry bag. I got this for my husband since he's been using the same old raggedy bag since we met. Between going to the gym and traveling, it saw its fair share of abuse. I got him this bag just for traveling and he likes it a lot. It is attractive and holds everything he needs quite nicely. High quality for an excellent price. Highly recommend!!!",1
Just received the honey. Looks great. However the lid arrived cracked and the seal was broken! Says no way to return or exchange. How can this be?! No pun intended. Sucks!,0
These have been good sheets. Haven't seen any issues with them so far.,1
Amazon did't disclose the return policy of restock fee which is called cheating.,0
"I thought the lotion would feel, a little more creamy. Feels very watery for lotion. Not satisfied, cant even tell of it moisturizes my body.",0
Don't buy. Very loud. And wont show up in my DVR settings. Crap..,0
1 week of use and the small candle stops recharging. Returned.,0
"Vengeance Be Mine by Louisa Lo is book one in the author’s Vengeance Demons series. I enjoy a good paranormal romance; however, this book would more accurately fall into the urban fantasy genre. Though this story is light on romance, it was a fun and interesting read. Megan’s hybrid personality, due to being half demon and half trickster, makes for an entertaining story, with a few twists and turns. If you are a fan of witty NA urban fantasy, check out the first in this series. Dee Words that Sparkle",1
My Uber passengers like it. Only charges one phone at a time though.,1
Wrong product was sent,0
If I could give a zero I would. I have emailed this company 3 times that I haven't receive my lunch bag. They told me the post office left a note of an attempted delivery. I've never received a slip. I've called the post office and they dont have my bag. The emails tells me to keep calling the post office. O just want my lunch bag or my money back.,0
It’s cute but very poor quality. Gets rusted quick.,0
"Pay very close attention to the size. It’s huge and shockingly HEAVY. Will easily scratch countertops if not extremely careful. Mine came without the pestle, so had to return, even though I was excited to use it.",0
These fit perfectly and were comfortable to wear all day . They did squeeze or give me a headache. And obviously adorable! Had so much fun matching these with outfits on my recent girls trip.,1
"Super cute but a little long, they don't stay in place and I have to constantly adjust them probably due to the length of them. They are very lovely however and I j\hope to be able to adjust them to fit.",1
Little smaller than anticipated but quality seems good,1
Great product if it would stay in the car plug. For some reason it kept pushing out.,0
Haven’t actually used as saving for move n new house. Reason for not giving a 5.,1
"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",0
Never received product,0
Came all crumble up didn’t like the way they packaged it,0
"Got a new computer and didn't want to reuse the old firewire card.... this one worked perfectly. No drivers, just install, turn on and it is there.",1
The flavor was great.,1
"Gave as Christmas gift, stopped working 3 mos. later. Very disappointed because it was a nice product and gave off a good amount of humidity to the air unlike some. I also thought it had a nice style. My return windo is closed unfortunately.",0
These stain markers work vey well for touching up stained wood furniture if it has been scratched or chipped. The stain does not adhere to all surfaces which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. I will also add that this is one of the better stain marker available and I have used many of what is out there.,1
Great sound but the cable that connects to the earphones come undone way to easy. If you’re moving around on stage a lot I wouldn’t recommend it.,0
"Pinches between ring and tube, extremely painful. Love that the end comes off, makes for great teasing and good cleaning.",1
"The shirt is NOT long at all. It does not fit like the advertised photo at all. The color is correct, that’s about it. I’m 5’7, 145 and ordered a large hoping it would be longer.. it is very wide and comes to my belt buckle. If I lift my arms my stomach will show.",0
I used for my daughters car seat & totally not what i expected. It looks supper cushioned and thick for comfort & it looks nothing like that its supper thin and not cushioned at all.,0
The brush head doesn’t stay on! It falls off so easily so you have to be super careful which takes away the convenience of doing it in the shower.,0
Did not work as claimed. Made a much bigger problem.,0
Very easy to install,1
The bags are awesome!! Kids loved them,1
"I originally ordered the 3x top, but it was a little too big in the bust. Sized down to the 2x and it's almost perfect. A little bit of rolling up, but other than that, super cute top.",1
"After 5 minutes of supervised play, the motor started making high pitched terrible screeching noises. Don't buy unless you have a tiny, useless little rat of a dog. Wasted $18.00",0
"Brightly colored, clean designs, well made. Expect to use them again and again.",1
Good quality product for the price. Well constructed and packaged.,1
Total waste of money. None worked. I try to inflate myself and the balloon immediately deflated so I went to a local balloon store and paid the owner blow up the others I bought the balloon still didn’t inflate...:( I totally do not recommend buying this product waste of money,0
"This mouse is absolute trash, it works for a few seconds and then stops. Don't waste your money",0
"Works great and shipped on time. A great value. This is the best leather conditioner I have found. As suggested by a professional, I rub into my car's leather seats with my bare hands. It is great for your hands too.",1
Digging tool bent the first time out in loose soil. Also the orange grip slips off.,0
Works great. Does not irritate my gums.,1
"The fabric has an awful odor, even after washing. Fabric also had a hole in it. Really liked style, though.",0
"I’m 5’3”, about 115 lbs and the small fit me a bit big. It wasn’t noticeable visibly so much as comfort, they fit but could be tighter over all. So I gave them to my roommate who is 5’5”, about 130 lbs and she loves them! I reordered them in grey because they didn’t have xs in Black. Over all they are cute and comfy and a solid material and I can’t wait to get my grey pair!",1
Great recipes for salt block cooking. Love that the pics are there to help guide you.,1
"There is an adjustment, but it's a very small hat. No option to order different sizing.",0
"I had high hopes for the lug nuts. I wanted the added security that these would provide. I have no issues with them performing as intended (holding my wheels in place). However, what I am unhappy with is the fact that I have had them on my truck for less than a week and they are already rusting. The paint that is applied to them is poor... I usually don't leave negative reviews, but I wanted to ensure that others know what will end up happening when they are purchased.",0
They sent me wrong item.,0
Great especially for kids. Why pay full price for a name brand with all the bells and whistles you get here with a MUCH better price!,1
"I only have good things to say about this gift bag set. I was able to wrap all of my Christmas gifts with the bags, gift wrap and tissue paper. The product is great quality and the different size options make it easier to choose the perfect one for every gift! I highly recommend it. The seller is absolutely sweet and attentive. He reached out to me after my purchase to make sure I was happy with my product. 5 stars all the way around!",1
"Cute bag, but I’ve only had it for a week and a half and the strap has already broken on one side. I didn’t even put anything heavy in it. Pretty disappointing considering it was not cheap.",0
These stockings already had a huge run in them when I opened them up. Otherwise they would have been great.,0
Very entertaining! Love this show ready for the next season! Keeps you guessing perfect girly suspenseful drama!,1
"works great, wanted the specialty blades.",1
Love the quality of lights. Ballast feel heavy duty! Very bright lights!!,1
Awesome case!! Very durable and my phone has not cracked. Only complaint is that it gets very dirty very easily :(,1
"not the best, but this is keto - it is good",1
I got this less then a week ago. It doesn’t work. When I went to return it I saw that they don’t accept returns or apply refunds for defective merchandise.,0
"Package came with four cartridges, the liquid inside one of them was completely yellow/brown",0
Perfect light at a very reasonable price,1
"Fit as expected, however there was a defect on the sleeve that i didn’t notice until after I washed it.",0
"Screen protector is garbage. The privacy screen is false. It degrades the quality of the screen. With it installed, there are dead zones of the screen",0
I needed the Catholic Bible I had gotten this one accidentally and They charged me for the return. Shame on them. It's the Holy Bible!,0
appeared to be a great product but I couldn't use it the stand pole was missing from the package other than that it would have been perfect,0
"I’m in love with this wallet! For the price, I was expecting it to look cheap, but it’s beautiful. I got the rose gold color and am always proud to take it in places. I love how organized my cards are and how much space there is!",1
"it does not work, only one hearing aid works at a time",0
"This review is for the refurbished- lesson learn, buy a new one. The dial was working up to the 6 level and from there to 10 there was no increase in power. Rotor started to smell like a burnt engine after 3 times of use.",0
"I have mixed thoughts on this skirt. For 1- I’m usually a small, I’m 5’5 and roughly 120 pounds, but I had to order an XL to fit me (and it’s still a smidge tight) but still wearable. The color seemed brighter to me than displayed in the pictures. I ordered a burgundy and it still is burgundy but looks more red than I would have liked, maybe that’s just personal preference. Also kinda see- through. You can’t see underwear lines or anything but you can clearly see leg imprints right through the dress. It’s jusy an OK skirt to me. Not bad, but not excellent. Great for less dressy occasion- festivals or beaches, etc.",1
"The writing is not streamlined, but I didn't see any typos. At first, I thought it was a military space story. I was soon disappointed to find out it was a story about a game junkie. The character was not likable and his wife was even worse. In the end, he got more than he bargained for trying to keep his addiction alive. Honestly, I enjoyed the space battle at the beginning and the rest of it, not so much. It wasn't my cup of tea. Thanks, but no thanks for any future episodes/books in a series of this story for me.",0
"These are very nice and well made, for the price they are an excellent value!",1
It's a very nice bag but much smaller than it looks in the picture. No returns on this item unfortunately,0
This product is every thing it is advertised to be. I would highly recommend the product. Will definitely purchase again,1
Images shows a double case pink one and green one. I only received the green. Not at all what i ecpected,0
"Item arrived quickly and looked to be in good condition, even included battery pre-installed. However, even though it should have been compatible with my 1999 Buick LeSabre, the remote failed to program or synchronize with the car. The instructions are easy enough and I know that I was following them correctly because I was able to successfully re-program my old remote fob. This new one, however, would not work and so I will be returning it. There was no problem with the seller or service, it just seemed that this particular item was defective or incompatible with my vehicle.",0
"After having the trampoline for only a couple months, our trampoline got a good size tear in it.",0
"It is very sensitive when measuring, small and portable, convenient to use when going out, of good quality, and very sanitary to use, without worrying about the risk of unclean and contact with bacteria.Data is also relatively accurate, a good helper in the kitchen, it is worth buying.",1
unbelievable that it is so easy to use and so helpful for organization. will buy it again and will recommend to friends.,1
Very cheap and the net is too low. It's fine for children,0
"For the price, it did everything that I hope it would do and not to mention I even let my window guy try it.",1
The quality of the answering machine is very poor. The messages are similar to a cell phone having poor reception. Same problem with incoming calls using the handset. The handsets are attractive but I'm returning it after one week. Very disappointing.,0
"I purchased it for a small ""add-on"" gift for a christening. Disappointed because I thought it was embroidered and not a transfer. For that price it should have been",0
"Had the less than a month and now there flicking and one already quit working don’t buy them go for a more expensive brand that’s better, u get what u pay for lol",0
"Does not stay in place, color is very pale!",0
"I smelled something burning, then realized this thing was shooting sparks. It had burnt and melted some of its components. Could have started the ceiling or wall on fire, it was shooting sparks pretty far. Totally broken now",0
Needs a couple days to flatten out but it does work very well to catch the litter.,1
"I purchased 2 packages of Non-Scratch HEAVY DUTY Scouring Pad or Pot Scrubber Pads and they work well with my Bar Tenders soap or with regular dish washing liquid. They do not scratch and work on many different surfaces. Well priced, i highly recommend them.",1
"Everytime it was connected to '03 rx300 to reset airbag light, this equipment triggered 2 new traction lights TRAC OFF and VSC, and could not reset them !!!",0
We bring the kid to Cape Cod this long weekend. The shelter is very helpful when we stay on the beach. Kid feel comfortable when she was in the shelter. It was cool inside of shelter especially if you put some water on the top of the shelter. It is also very easy to carry and set up. It is a good product with high quality.,1
"Very nice suspenders but mine are defective. One of the clips is missing the nylon teeth insert and does not hold onto pants. This makes them useless. However, if they were not defective, they would have been great suspenders. I will try my luck again likely.",0
Cute but not sewn right. The lines were off and it was crazy tight around my calves and ankles and lose on my thighs,0
"The markers themselves are quite nice, but the cap on the brush end has a design flaw. Beware that if you don't exercise extreme caution when putting the cap on the brush end you will end up with a mutilated tip that kind of defeats the joy of having the nice pointy brush tip. Other than that all were nice and juicy and none dried out.",1
I think for the price it's very beautiful. It may or may not turn your wrist green I wouldn't wear it in the shower or anything but it's very very pretty for costume jewelry.,1
The perfect pajamas for my sweet granddaughter that came to visit. She loved them.,1
I don’t like it because i ordered twice they sent me the one expired. No good .I don’t want to buy anymore.,0
Didn’t keep my hands warm at work stocking frozen foods,0
"It's an ok sand, it's really rough, it is definitely not like the geographic channel sand or moon sand. It's just sand.",0
I am not impressed at all. No matter how much i fluff it every day I find it to be a very uncomfortable pillow.,0
These are nothing like the first bunch I bought. They don't stay lit. They barely smolder for more than 30 seconds. You have to stand right on top of them to get any scent!,0
Smudges by the afternoon. Looks like I have raccoon eyes. Very disappointed.,0
"Just received this in the mail and was struck as to how poor the quality is and how lack luster the workmanship is. There are numerous tucks and wrinkles along the edge and the seam binding/edging just ends - no finishing where it meets itself. The print job is terrible-while it look like a tortilla at a distance, up close it just looks horribly cheap. OK, so I didn't expect it to be super high quality, but I did expect it to be the advertised 60 inches which was the size I needed for a project. Well, it wasn't even that - it came up 2 inches short. Very sad that it feel so terribly short. It would have been perfect if it had been as advertised. I am returning it.",0
Item arrived later than expected and missing two bolts. This was only discovered after reaching last step of assembly. Trying to figure out a solution because I don't want to take this thing apart and ship it back. Otherwise it seems like a good grill.,0
It arrived on time and seems to be sturdy,1
Not so good and my dog destroy it within three days... Maybe my dog is too strong.,0
"I bought this product for my mom. She loved it!! She swear its the best thing beside sliced bread.... After 4 months this product no longer works!!!!!! Please dont purchase any electrical products from Amazon. I tried contacting the Seller, no response. The products was only used a couple of times!!! Money thrown away.",0
"Reformatted to NTFS, copied an mp4 and played the file. Works fine. Looks durable. I'm satisfied.",1
"A lot smaller than I expected, couldnt use it. I gave it away. Good for kittens, not regular cats.",0
Works to protect phone. Clear plastic allows me to still use most of the functions especially taking photos. It does not seem to affect the quality of the photos too much.,1
I didn't like the recipes.,0
Bought it for a present for my husband he loved it.,1
I like the case but the screen protector was cracked upon arrival. Don’t want to risk having my phone without a case for a day so I will just end up ordering a new screen protector. Bummer.,0
"I hurt my calf doing double unders during a workout. I think I may have had a tiny little tear. I bought this brace and wear it every day, regardless of the workout. Two weeks later I am able to do double unders with no pain. I am going to continue to wear this for a few more weeks and then always on days that require jumping. It is flexible, comfortable and adjustable. I have big old fat calf muscles...so I am always worried about things fitting. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is I was hoping it would be ""firmer"" or...more compression.",1
"it works but it’s hard to pull the bags from the bottom, I just pull it from the top.",1
Like the product . Easy to apply. I have tried the others and nothing works as maybelline works for me.,1
"I used these once and then threw them away. The first problem was that they didn't work (they didn't absorb sweat at all). Then when I washed them in the washing machine, they practically fell apart. These had good reviews, so I was optimistic and bought 2 pair instead of trying out with just one first. That was a mistake. I would not order these again. At all.",0
Absolutely horrible vinyl does not stick at all I even had my heat breast up to 450 and it still wouldn't,0
Not the real thing. I bought 2 of these hoping it would replace the original batteries well. Both worked for about 2 minutes and rhen neither worked again. Just pay the extra and get the real things.,0
Trigger warning. I’m sick and tired of TV shows using rape as plot. It’s disgusting.,0
"Not only does the ring not close, there is no way that it is 18G like I ordered. I have always worn 18G in my nose and this would not go in my nose due to how thick it was.",0
"Just received but haven’t opened it yet, however very disappointed in the appearance of the package. It’s crumbled, looks beats up, opened and parts looked to have been moved around. Quite disappointed for this being ordered through amazon. Hopefully product is not damaged.",0
I used this product to help me with rehab for my torn ACL! Really helps to improve circulation and therefore comfort when bending my knee! Highly recommend!!,1
"After use, became too loose.",0
Hard to view in daylight. Would not recommend.,0
I really like these. These work as well as Philips Sonicare brand,1
Case snapped after less than a month. Really disappointed,0
Very clean looking and soft to the touch. I love it,1
My stepson loves for our trip!,1
Packaging arrived dirty and broken as if the item was already used and returned. Felt very awkward giving as a gift.,0
Mango butter was extremely dry upon delivery.,0
I don't normally write reviews but this was bad. As soon as I opened the bag it smelled terrible. Once I held the toothbrush it caused me to gag. It smelled as if it had been dead for 2 weeks. I am not even joking. Tried boiling it for 10 min with no success. There is no way I would give this to my dog. It smells much worse.,0
"It seems strong and looks nice. It feels great on my face, I am happy with this purchase",1
"I measured my dogs necks so I could buy the correct size- they were 10 inches exact. Technically the XS was their correct size, but it would have been super tight.",1
"This was my first menstrual cup and unfortunately it just didn't work for me. Even after getting the hang of putting it in and taking it out, the silicone is just way to firm for me. I bought the small size but maybe the diameter was still to wide? It was too painful to wear.",0
I am 44 years old and I am a size 10-12 with a bra size of 36D. The XL was a perfect fit. It has plenty of support on the top and covers the bottom perfectly. I wanted a swimsuit that was cute and still covered me. But I didn’t want to look like an old lady! This swimsuit is perfect and the quality is great. This was my first swimsuit purchase online and is a winner!!,1
Did not spray a mist; only a stream and no directions provided to try to fix the problem.,0
Not nearly enough light. My small standard size blacklight bulb was much better and from the Dollar store.,0
Expected a box of chips for a large dog. Instead a medium size bag with chips cut into strips. For the price very disappointing. You can do better.,0
"I look fabulous with this glasses on, totally worth it! :D",1
"I really like this fitness watch. I like that it tracks my steps, heart rate, and sleep. My only issues that I’ve ran into have been that I hit something once that started a timer and for an hour it ran while I tried to figure out how to turn it off. I still don’t know how it came on and how it eventually turned off. The charger is a little bit of a pain. Other than that I really like the watch itself. It also is at a great price!",1
"This sports bra runs very small I normally wear a small for running or medium if just doing weights. Based on the reviews I ordered a large and it does fit very well without any bulging. It didn’t move around I didn’t think anything was going to fall out. But I wish it gave me a more support like a regular bra does. I’m a 34B, 5’ 6” and 132 pounds. Overall I like the bra. The quality was pretty good for the price. Not flimsy and should hold up. I love the strappy look in the back! I’m giving it four stars only because I wished it gave me a better shape in the front. I will still be ordering more of these.",1
Disappointed in size. We have some other of these type of ashtrays and they are taller.,1
I bought 2 of these sets we love them but unfortunately 2 of the lights are not able to turn on because they are defective,0
I enjoy the content. The quality of the cover is really bad. I have only had it for two months and it is falling apart and I have ised it with care.,0
Hard to properly lay it and squeeze out the air bubbles at the same time ... hopefully it stays in tack if not there’s two more in the pack that I can use I guess,1
"Marker runs out quickly, wish you could buy replacement markers",1
"Great diaper bag!! A lot of room for everything I need for my babies (I have 2) , lightweight even if the bag is full of things! Highly recommend!",1
"Half the box was crushed, the other half packed poorly.",0
Another great Louise Penny read. I am hoping she will continue the series but I understand if she doesn't continue..,1
"Having the Big Book in my smartphone and Kindle e-reader is really a great convenience. I prefer it over a paper copy in Big Book study meetings, because I can add highlights and notes and easily find them later. Searching the text is also a great advantage. I haven't personally found any textual errors The page numbers are broken, though. In the current (as of Oct. 30, 2019) update of the book, ""go to page"" searches are useless. For example, go to page 86 takes you to page 165 of the actual book. Previous updates worked correctly, and I'm confident the publisher will correct the problem, but for now it's annoying and renders the e-book less useful.",1
My nephew loved these.,1
"I was so disappointed in these shoes. They took so long to be delivered, without and shipping updates whatsoever. When I finally got them I discovered a cheaply made shoe. The platform is either styrofoam or a stacked cardboard like material, and the straps are a very thin and cheap looking felt. The buckle on the ankles do not even properly clasp. I’m giving this product two stars because in pictures and from a distance they do serve the look I am trying to achieve.",0
"I bought this for one specific tag on my inner thigh. After using it multiple times over the course of a couple months. it has yet to do anything. The tag turns white, becomes uncomfortable to clothing , and then just remains the way it was. So a waste of 50 bucks.",0
I used this product for two weeks and it started bugging out.. after spending 60$ I was not impressed with how fast it broke,0
This case is amazing. I am always on the road for work and having a battery case is so much easier than trying to remember my charging cord. This case has a full battery when charged and will charge the same time as my phone at night,1
"Not great. I had a flexible screen cover that was too tacky to the touch, so wanted a hard cover. This cover is small by comparison, which leaves an edge that actually gathers a lot of dust. Not to mention that edge is where the adhesive is, so there's no getting rid if the dust. This all makes it blatantly obvious that there is a cover on the phone. The adhesive at the edge is the only adhesive, too. Which leaves the cover with gaps- now touch points are inaccurate. Typing on a touch screen is hard enough, now I have to ""push"" hard to record taps. All of the cutouts are in the edge as well, not surrounding the home button, camera, etc. And the fit isn't good around them either. Does it work? Yes, it protects the screen. But not blending into the phone is annoying. Maybe a hard cover is really hard for a curved screen phone, but I'd keep looking for better if I were you. I'm going to ...",0
Second one came broken,0
Clasps broke off after having for only a few months 😢,0
"This is an ok clock. The dim is either bright or off, there isn't really an in between setting. It's fine for the price and I like the size.",1
as described. great buy.,1
It didn't stay opened very well when bent backwards.,1
It was so beautiful.,1
I wasn't please at all it broke a piece fell off very disappointed 😔,0
"Exactly what I expected. I ordered these to use in my bar as we rotate our beers often, and they look great.",1
It matches well for under my eyes. Was in a car accident & have permanent dark damage under one eye. Covers it nicely. Lasts pretty long and covers up scars. After some skin cancer surgery the Dr. recommended this to help cover the scars which it does. Very creamy! Does not last if it gets wet however. Need to reapply if you cry or your eyes tear from allergies,1
"This is our 4th automatic kwikset lock. Not sure what is going on during manufacturing but they work well for a while then all of a sudden the lock just stops working; beeps for no reason, the keypad doesnt respond when the code is pressed and it randomly goes through a series of locking and unlocking without being triggered. I wish I could return this and get my money back. We replaced the batteries before going on vacation, our pet sitter called us to come home because the lock would not respond when she entered the code. We had to come home from vacation to make sure our dogs were ok! Dangerous and a piece of junk!",0
Purchased 2 of these for me and my son. It is way too tight to fit credit cards into the slots that they are supposed to fit in.,0
"Good for washing windows or power-spraying your house, but I wouldn't use that sprayer on a garden.",0
"The one star is because it looks great. Otherwise I went through three motor assemblies and all of them failed, the first didn’t even work out of the box. The deadbolt motor assembly is so cheap it cannot last on daily use for more than a week.",0
"To be honest this wallet is ideal for the simple man which I am, however I purchased this item for the concept of hold 30 bills. Upon receiving I was showing a cashier my wallet and he lets me try 25 one dollar bills in the clip and it doesn’t even have a chance at magnetism. To be honest this upset me the most as I purchased it for this reason, their approach at saying these are rare magnets thatll hold 30 bills is a complete lie and over sell. Again the wallet is amazing for the simple man, however unless you like being lied too this is not your wallet.",0
"For the size and quality, Def a good price. Better than something you can find at Marshalls.",1
The cord broke after about 6 months of light use. It’s a shame as it sounded pretty good up until now.,0
Not as good as I expected it to be. Have to continue to pump it to make it work.,0
Worked great on my clients edges. If you combine it with too many products though it could turn white so just be careful,1
Cheap knock off that came with rust on it. Sent it right back.,0
I'm sure its a lovely book.. Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. Not very please with the looks of it.,0
Product came broken. The bottom plastic piece looked like it was dropped and was broken on the corner. It taken more time to be returned and replaced so no I have to tape and glue it?!?,0
All i have to do is pick it up and the dogs know that they need to be quiet.,1
"The vases I purchased were not what I expected. Quite a few were covered in wax, I recieved 16 not 18 and there was no cleaning cloth included.",0
"Expensive, but won't oxidize metal. Maybe better than soap",1
So my Apple Watch band came today and I must say I’m very impressed with the product I had no problems tanking my old bands off it was very easy to put on the only problem I’m having is that some of the glitter is falling off the band but over all I like itb,1
"The massager is pretty simple to use. I like the length, it wraps the body well. I mostly use it in the stomach area for a few minutes, and interestingly after a few days it felt like the ab muscles had worked out, because it felt a bit tight. The massager says to not use it for more than 15 minutes in an area. The cord is pretty long, which is nice. And the remote for it is so simple, it's just a knob to change the intensity of the vibration. I like that you can take the massager out of the velcro wrap/pouch thing. I think the only annoying thing for me is the zipper, when I have the massager ON, due to the vibrations, the zipper starts tapping on the zipper teeth. Overall, I think the massager is pretty useful.",1
The magnet in the pen fell out shortly after my grandson received it in the mail we didn't find this out until we came to visit after the 30 day return. Poorly made and pretty much useless after only one month.,0
This game feels real and it is very scary. I got so scared I quit the game I found like 6 ghosts in 1 room.,1
I like the color. It has a strange odor to it. It's a little rough.,0
"Ordered a 4 pack, waited almost 2 weeks for delivery. And then was sent the wrong item. Will be returning",0
"I love that the lights are bright, flash and change colors. They demand attention. I hope people see me and avoid hitting me rather than wonder ""what is that?"" and run me over to get a closer look. So, I wrapped them around the pole. It looks awesome. But the next day, the clear, squishy plastic came off in places. Don't try this at home. Even if I did no harm, it doesn't look good. I bought two, one had a rip in the plastic. The replacement will go on the other pole without getting bent, twisted,rolled or mutilated.",1
not at all what was advertised,0
I returned this product because I didn't like how it looked on. The dress was a little big for what I thought a large would be. I would've kept if it was just a little bit smaller.,0
On the picture the at amazon market place the leather look shiny and more vibrant but see it when it came after waiting month and the half to see my leather car seats cover. I was disappointed at the material because the leather look like a PU leathers not genuine as it said.i will appreciate a little compensation.,0
I bought this to help keep my sons curls soft and moisture . So far I haven’t noticed any change.,0
Product arrived with no documentation: shipping paper or instructions for use sheet. Bottle does have Dosage Guidelines in tiny print.,0
grandson leaves the electronics to use this everyday!,1
Fits perfectly. Well thought out.,1
This umbrella is so awesome the color changes so much gun,1
Works fine and no complaints.,1
"Amazingly these fit really good. Didn’t show any of my cellulite wow, also helps hide muffin top. I ordered more.",1
I love the fact my car no longer is a mess!,1
"It is a nice looking chair. It was easy to assemble and arrived on time. I am not crazy about the wheels, they get stuck a lot.",1
"Works great, holds well but the key gets jammed a lot.",1
The built in speakers are of bad quality and only some vinyls sound good. Extremely disappointed with the quality of the speakers.,0
We loved these sheets st first but they have proven to be poor quality with rips at seams and areas of obvious wear from very rare use on our bed. Very disappointed. Would NOT recommend.,0
Horrible product! Does not glide on smoothly and consistently. Will never purchase again. Trashed.,0
"I consider this filter very user friendly. Came with everything you need and the instructions were easy to follow-- my favorite part , I was pleasantly surprised by how quiet this filter was.",1
The color looks very rich and the fabric feels good on the skin. Runs a little snug tho.,1
Easy to clean. Great length for my toddler!,1
Quick delivery and good product,1
The fountain arrived damaged and was different than the photo on Amazon. Color was different (black vs speckled) and texture of sphere on top was different. I processed the return through Amazon but the seller doesn't provide a pre-paid shipping label so I had to lug it to a UPS store to ship instead of just getting pick-up at my door. Then I had to provide the shipping number and the shipping cost to get reimbursed for it. Really cumbersome to deal with. I will check more carefully for return process when buying from an Amazon seller!,0
I haven't quite finished but it's a good read.,1
Not as good as the stuff with silicone but probably one of the best water based I've had,1
Great product for the price. As accurate as it needs to be for my game. Wouldn’t make a difference if it was off a yard or two. Slope feature makes a huge difference!!! Gotta have steady hands though. The flag was hard to hit sometimes.,1
"So cheap, broke in two week",0
"There is definitely ghosting on the other side of the page when you write, but I can live with that. I bought the white one which has stayed surprisingly clean through months of daily use.",1
Ouch--major splinters when you hold these. They need to be finished. Sent them back.,0
Is this really white air dry clay? Maybe it's going to dry white? Much darker color than expected.,0
I’ve read all of the Peridale mysteries in the last few months and have enjoyed everyone of them. Now I’m impatiently waiting for the next one to come out.,1
"Funky, with poor battery life. When working was fine. Replacing batteries every month is a joke. Don't bother buying this",0
"Bought a set came with a remote, and was not capable of bluetooth. They replaced the box and after being installed it lasted 2 hours. No refund. poor product quality and not worth the money you pay if it never was fully functional from the beginning.",0
"The video quality is terrible, the video freezes and does not detect motion in the moment when the sensor chimes, when it's daylight sometimes video comes through in black and white and finally any small wind will/can cause the sensor to go off.",0
Still going good. Strong enough for my middle schooler,1
My toddler grandsons seem to like them the only thing I wish it would have included in this set is like larger solid pieces that you could use for a base etc.,1
"Product was not to my liking seemed diluted to other brands I have used, will not buy again. Sorry",0
Great little quick charger.I got my wife's iPhoneX.She always stuffed it in and told me she made her the beast.It charges your phone so fast that it doesn't get hot even if you charge it too fast.She can even use her 10-foot cable.I strongly recommend anyone looking for a good solid quick charger.,1
Helps with my leg cramps,1
The bars of the heart and the hanging design were two diffrent bar sizes.,0
"High quality product, good vibration, easy to clean.",1
Works great and easy to install by ourselves,1
"The adhesive is not put around the entire edges of the cup, so the pasties folds awkwardly leave your breasts appearing oddly shaped and the cup prone to peeling off. Made this completely unwearable.",0
I love this trimmer and I’ve tried many. It really supports your back and the 2 straps keeps it tight. A must have!!!!!,1
"Wrong color suspension and quality compared to picture. Picture shows different suspension, color. Very disappointed.",0
"Sent this back. Super annoying to put together. But the last straw is that you can't user the drawers as storage. The bottom is not load bearing. Appropriate only for hanging files. For this price, that doesn't work for me",0
"when plugged in, it needed support at the bottom or doesn't make complete contact with outlet. I placed my luggage and a shoe underneath for support.",0
"For the S3 Gold: Color matches perfectly, but the band I received is not the same quality as the other BRG bands I’ve bought. The middle metal clasp that attaches to the watch is extremely loose. The entire clasp that slides into the watch is also loose and wiggles. The magnetic clasp to lock the bracelet in place also slides off easily. I love that the color matches, but I either got a defective band or the quality has gone down.",0
Worked perfect for my wedding tables,1
I like them a lot the only thing is I have small hands so some of the fingers are a little big,1
Not as described and it’s missing element to the female elf ... bottom trim looks bad ... I had it delivered to someone to customize it and I’m really upset that it wasn’t put together better !,0
The game is fine but they sent the one that was not ... Please if you do not have the order to indicate it before the purchase ... Be more serious ... That's why I had not taken the time to evaluate them ... Very bad. I wanted the fifa 2018 World not this game :(,0
Not as good as I expected,0
"The socks are cute, However I ordered the black, white, pink and yellow but recieved the socks pictured below. They are for my niece's birthday and it's too late to return and reship....disappointed.",0
Looks awesome and made well. Looks movie quality. Would give 5 stars but it was slightly snug. Other than that it was perfect,1
"Charges OK, but didn't recognize my external HDs, not what I needed, returned.",0
Really disappointed. So small for the price!,0
"It's really a toy, not binoculars. The magnification and construction are good, but the field of view is TINY. You have to really get the width adjustment right or you won't see much. A little frustrating for my 4 year old, but good enough for older kids who can adjust themselves.",1
Love how realistic they look.,1
Product was never received. Seller contacted and still no product.,0
"Very good case, better then expected",1
Item didn't even turn on after charging.Door to dvd holder seemed weak.,0
"Works great but door could be designed a little better. Really, would it cost that much more to put hinges on it?",1
"Paired with the VIVOSUN Digital Seedling Heat Mat Thermostat Controller, this heating mat allows me to keep the temp of my pepper and tomato seedlings at a steady 80 degrees. I'm on my second batch--this combination took a full week and a half off my usual germination time under lights at room temp. Reliable and does exactly what it says it will do.",1
We've had nothing but problems with it doesn't function and the screen is constantly having problems will not stay on troubleshoot is it and still the screen will not come on,0
this was not the twine that I received. I go some janky white yarn instead of twine.,0
Great! Just as described.,1
this candy is very hard hard hard never again,0
I was not impressed at all. The applicator is big and bushy. So big that you can't see your bottom lashes to put it on. Usually when you remove the brush from the tub there is product hanging off the tip. It just isn't great for putting on mascara. And I didn't see anything special about what it did for my lashes.,0
Doesn’t look anything like the case.. brought for a gift and I don’t even want to give it to her,0
"Worked right out of the box. I have an 18v Dewalt drill. Would give 5stars, but I haven’t tried to charge them yet.",1
The quality was not a strong as I thought. My phone did get hot when charging. But it shuts off when reacts 100%,1
Buy Spectra original parts. The backflow protectors pop off constantly. And the Spectra pumping bottles don't secure to the flanges at all. They don't provide a tight fit. These are not at all worth it. Buy Spectra brand.,0
The case is flimsy and feels cheap.,0
"Only thing that might be helpful would be to place the USB connector somewhere easier to get to. Loved the comfort, light weight, sound quality, controls great stereo separation and finally the price! What an amazing bargain in today's market!!",1
Probably nothing wrong with the product. The issue is Apple from what I've read. Plugged it in and within 3 minutes the sound is off and message states that it's not supported by Apple. What's the point?,0
I’m having a hard time getting in to it. Tried to return but it cost to return.,0
Love it! Bought one pair for me and one for my mom :-),1
"Box and sealed packet was dry, but the charcoal bags arrived wet. Was unable to determine why this would be, so returned them.",0
"I'm an avid senior softball player at the age of 62 but I became frustrated because of knee pain which was preventing me from playing or playing with excruciating pain. I've tried many different brands and I received limited relief this Puritan brand literally worked to eliminate joint pain in my throwing shoulder and my knees it was so evident. i recall that it started working within two weeks, it's now fun and enjoyable playing w/out pain . I'm going on my second year of taking it and I'll continue for the rest of life. For me, taking two at once in the morning works.....Aloha.",1
Nice hawk. Throws very well if you know how to throw it. First time throwing stuck 5 out of six. Very sharp. Only thing I dislike is sheath. Hard to configure it to get hawk in and out rapidly. Still good for storing though.,1
Order the set with 2 cables . Black housing. Only got 1 cable no housing,0
Plates won’t snap in. The keep falling out no master how hard you push. Leaks every where. Handle won’t snap shut. It’s good difficult to use. It’s not like my d sandwich maker I used in college. Only reason I wanted another one-the simple ease of making sandwiches. But this is more headache than worth it. I’m cleaning the mess it’s made.,0
I love these glasses very good condition as I expected it.,1
This is such a cute dress!!! I can’t believe it’s from Amazon. Only thing is that the clasps than hold the straps from sliding broke in the wash. I was able to pin them. You get what you pay for and at this price it’s worth it even if you only get a few wears out of it,1
Lots of static. Can barely hear my music,0
Way to easy made poorly brakes left an right bad buy if u ask me if had 3 replacements already wow right not even a day bad buy period,0
"I've used this since 2016 and it has held up with everyday usage since then. I use it on the road when I travel, and now that I travel so much, I bought a second one, so as to have one permanently in my personal vehicle and another in my travel vehicles. Totally would buy if you want something simple and sleek to the dash.",1
"No issues with the cartridges, works just like the originals, but substantially less money. Recommend.",1
The lotions is too liquidy and does not apply nicely. It leaves me sticky. I would like to return but it looks like that’s not optional.,0
"Doesn't go to edge. If you put a case on it, it will push protector off.",0
All meats and seafood stick to this grill. I have to put oil on the grill to prevent sticking. They need to remove 'non-stick' from the description because it's not.,0
Better off buying the kits,0
"Fortunately, I won’t have to read anymore. Really a slog with 2D characters and predictable situations.",0
This thing was soo cheaply made. Horrible quality. It broke as we were putting the pieces together. I do not recommend buying this product at all. Waste of money.,0
"Very bright screen and poor audio, neither can be changed.",0
Didn't do anything for my hair or nails. I really think the positive reviews are from people that just have naturally fast growing hair. Save your money.,0
Does not seem to last long,0
"If you are looking for a moisturizer, this isn’t for you. It is too light.",0
"I just love this case! It's very feminine. The reason for four stars is because the built in screen protector is awful! Made my phone look vintage. I already have a glass screen protector installed, so I put the case in the dryer and melted the glue and pulled the screen protector off. Now it's petfect! This will do until my custom case comes in!",1
"These cables are wonderful, And the customer service is great! Nice, Feel good. In my family it is necessary. These cables are a great value. I'm extremely satisfied with the speedy delivery! Exactly what I wanted.",1
Used pump on a John Deere with Kohler engine. Pumped worked for 1 month and then failed.,0
Definitely works for my small space but it’s not easy to install. I live in an building with very high ceilings. You have to adjust from the top and with the small space I had to stand on the toilet to get it to the right height then get my head between the wall/counter and the toilet to tighten from the bottom. Like I said it works great but took more effort then expected.,1
I usually buy jackets in XL but this one runs large so I bought a L. Fits great and doesn’t smell like fish like the dickies pants do. Very nice and thick.,1
"The case closes awkwardly due to the large nail clippers. Also, the picture shown is misleading since the two nail clippers shown in it are the smaller ones, and the product I received came with a large and small nail clipper.",0
Great placement for toddlers!,1
"Wish the picture was brighter. Doesn't matter how sunny it is out, the picture looks dark. Also the mirror wiggles and bounces around some, but not terrible.",1
Works better than expected,1
Does not really do much of a difference. My wife stopped using it and was disappointed.,0
Fits great kinda expensive but it’s good quality,1
Arrived completely melted! Would not recommend!,0
"When I opened my package, it had black marks all over it.",0
The parts did not fit together well. It clogged up and stopped working in less than 24 hours. I returned it.,0
The quality is awful. Don’t recommend.,0
It does not work iPhone 8 Plus I would like to have a return label you sent it back,0
"Fits well and of decent quality, but seems highly unlikely to be OEM as the item title states. It ships with black tape covering samsung and s6. I'm not sure if i didn't get any adhesive with mine, or its supposed to already be applied to the piece but it didn't stick very well. The tool is ok, but you will need a heat source to get the glue to weaken enough to get the glass started coming off. Mine was shattered so pieces of glass kept breaking off trying to get underneath it, but once it started it came off pretty easily. After having this installed a few months, its cracked in multiple places and glass is falling off. Whatever it's made of breaks easily.likely won't be a very long term fix for a busted case.",0
"Light was installed, and tried a few days, I really like it, the elders of the family like it too, said that is energy saving and environment friendly.",1
How can this be bed bug proof If it doesn't completely close the mattress in. I was disappointed that the mattress cover didn't completely closed the mattress inside it just went on top that's no protection at all.,0
"Love the look of the case. Very minimal protection, but decent value for the price. I would recommend this case to someone who is not prone to phone abuse.",1
