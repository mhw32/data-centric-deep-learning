It is worth it for the top! It is really flattering but the highwaisted bottoms just hit at an awkward area for me. I have a little bit of a pooch but it seems to have made it look worse. I'm 5'4 136lbs and 36C.,1,0

"2006 Honda Accord sedan. Had a difficult time trying to install unit. Fully assembled, the unit was not fitting into the small space. The arms were hitting and I could not get it to go in. Not sure if this is the way to go, but I disconnected the rod from the motor gear so I could ""flatten"" out the linkage. Once I did this the unit slid into place very easily. The only hard part was reconnecting the arm to the motor gear. You have just enough room to fit your fingers in behind the linkage. Then you have to press, HARD, to get it to ""snap"" into place on the ball. Other than that issue, everything seemed to go smoothly.",1,0

It was relatively easy to assemble this spice rack following the instructions. I love that the height is adjustable because when I initially set it up it didn't fit where I want it. But no problem it was easy enough to adjust the height and now I have a very organized pantry. Very happy with the purchase!,1,0

"This is a handsome looking knife, but it has some fatal flaws. The locking feature broke within a few days of receiving it. This is too small a knife and too sharp an edge to have the blade swinging freely without the ability to lock it open. Also, this is a really heaving object for it's small size, making it pretty much useless as a knife you would carry around, which is kind of the purpose of a small knife like this. I had to send it back for a refund.",0,0
"This is great for my life proof nuud case. I see it doesn‚Äôt cover the full screen entirely but it‚Äôs very slight and doesn‚Äôt impair functionality. It is working great so far I love how sleek the screen feels, almost naked like if it was the iPhone glass itself. I give it 5 stars due to the fact I already dropped it twice on its face and it still hasn‚Äôt broke on day one! I will keep u updated on the wear and tear over time.",1,0

"I might've been happier if my guaranteed set wasn't hot pink, but overall it is what I expected: some weird color combos (lots of half/half and speckles), a few really excellent dice, several D6 with pips instead of numbers, and a few factory seconds that are chipped along the edges or have paint issues. I'm going to end up repainting the excessively ugly dice that were included, but overall definitely worth the cost and the fun of opening up the bag and seeing what you got.",1,0

A nice solid headphone hanger! Spring loaded to clip on to most desk / surfaces. It has 2 foam pads for both grip and to protect the surface that you clip it to.

Nexlux could have a better description of what other pieces are required to do things like connect the lights to the extension wire and then reconnect after running behind cabinets and into a soffit etc. That part was tedious and cost them a star.",1,0
It looks great. Good quality. Only thing is the team names arent attached on the plate itself. It is 2 plastic plates glued to the metal frame. So word of advice. Is to put super glue on edges of team names. And that should hold longer.,1,0
"Wow, I must say I‚Äôm impressed with how these came packaged and presented. They include instructions that give a link to a quick video on installation.

"All the pockets and functionality are just right. I can't really find anything about the usability that annoys me such as pockets or organization not quite right. The pockets are placed and sized well and I find them all useful. The most annoying thing about it is that it does not stand up straight on its own, however, it has a very predictable side that it falls to. It leans predictably so it is not an actual issue against it's overall usability.",1,0

"I had this case ready for my new iPhone 11 Pro, which came today. The case fits around the phone nicely, but the screen sits proud of the case (above) instead of having a protective lip. In other words, if you put the phone/case face down on a table, the screen touches the table. If you have a screen protector on your phone (which you should!) it'll be even more pronounced. They just need to adjust the manufacturing parameters to make the case deeper; otherwise it's a solid case. Unfortunately, I'm going to return it and find a case that protects the screen properly.",0,0

"There is no adjustment on the belt loop connection and it hangs way too low on the thigh. When you've used others that are comfortable to run around with, this just feels cheap and poorly made.

The nice feature of this is that the middle leg has a USB charging connection on the end so you do not have to search for a wire connector. When it is charging the light glows red until fully charged and the it goes out. The lamp also has multiple intensity levels so you can adjust for brightness and loss of battery power. The clip is a bit problematic with paperbacks - a longer jaw would be better. The lamps flexibility is stiff so it holds it shape nicely.,1,0
"Well, the mother card came damaged and I can not return it because I'm from another country and the cost of sending the package is greater than the price of the card, so it's not worth it. The card is beautiful and comes well packaged, but unfortunately it came damaged from the factory, it does not turn on or the LED lights that it has on the part of the external connectors. The criticism is for those people who buy the items internationally, bear in mind that they can lose their money if it is damaged and the cost of returning it to amazon is much higher than the price of the item.",0,0

This printer is horrible. It's way too complicated and is constantly giving error messages. The printer drawer and output drawers are very cheaply made.

"I purchased these in February. Recently I tried to use them and unfortunately each time I try one my Keurig machine gives me an error message that the pod is not compatible with my machine. I have been using Donut Shop pods in my machine since I first purchased it and have never had a problem. Upon closer examination of the coffee pod, I noticed that the code printed on the top of the pod isn't very legible so I can only assume that I have a bad box. I purchased a box of 72 which is 6 boxes of 12 each. I have even tried one from each of the 6 boxes and keep getting the same error message. I know it's not my machine because other pods I try work just fine. It's only out of this shipment that I am having this issue. Very disappointing since my return window has expired.

"Nice shiny smooth material, long enough, but the skirt fits super tight and slides up. Seriously, for the size they made the shorts underneath, which fit perfect on a 5‚Äô8‚Äô‚Äô size 18, the skirt is like a super tight pencil skirt, the skirt is more a size 14-16. It might work better if I lose another 10 lbs, but then the shorts might be too baggy. And the inside front has this white secondary panel. I guess it‚Äôs for not showing anything on the front? But it‚Äôs stupid and super itchy and makes the suit fit all thick and bunchy on the front, and it‚Äôs waist band to knees, left outer seam to right outer seam. The back is smooth and silky and comfortable. Not gusseted, so it could crawl up if you get it fit too tight. I‚Äôm cutting out the weird white liner to see if that helps anything, and maybe the skirt wont slide up when it‚Äôs wet, or I may tack it to the side seam on the shirts. And no drawstring at the waist, which fits well on a small waist/ big booty combo, but might get heavy and pull down in water. Other than that, it‚Äôs a good length, hits the top of my kneecap/crease at the back of my knee.",0,0

"This product is great, but the instructions suck... also, it took me and my brother over an hour to figure out why the Power Magic Pro wasn't working. We located the correct fuses, checked them with a multi-meter and everything. Still, nothing. Turned out, the grounding screw in my car wasn't good. We had to find another one. Also, you have to charge the Power Magic Pro a little bit to get it going.

True to color and a great size. The adhesive is actually very strong. Properly clean the surface before attempting to install.

"Only a couple weeks after mounting using the included adhesive, the mount gave out and dropped my Rift ruining the display. The included adhesive is not strong enough, and while I planned to mount using the included screws in the near future, I figured the adhesive would hold until my room was ready for the permanent mount. It was not and gave out in the middle of the night. Very frustrated right now and I wouldn't complain if no adhesive was included but instead an adhesive too weak for the job is, making it too easy for this to happen.",0,0

"This thing really works to lessen the impacts. Definitely makes a hard tail bike ride much nicer. It is well made, except that there is a little more play in the bushings that I think is needed. As a result, the seat can actually rock side to side a little. This does not bother me at all when riding, and may actually be a benefit, but I worry that it will get worse as it wears. Regardless, what this seat post does is transform your hard tail bike into something you‚Äôll will want to ride more, and it makes the bike more capable. I currently have it on a fat bike. I have another good full suspension trail bike, but I doubt that I‚Äôll buy another FS bike, ‚Äòcause you can get a hard tail and still have comfort if equipped with this post.",1,0

"let me start off by saying this is not a bad rating for the product but rather Amazon for not delivering on time. So my order was over 8 days ago and Amazon barely shipped my package. All I received was an email indicating that the package would be late. The website continues to indicate that there were 15 miter saws still in stock. So when I get the shipping email, it moves the date by 5 additional days. No effort to ship over night or provide a more expeditious delivery what so ever. how can anyone even consider buying here for black Friday or Christmas. Amazon wants to act like they are still the only option for online shopping. I could just have easily order this on homedepot or lowes or Walmart online. I could have received this same day had I gone to the store. And it is much easier to return something is there is issues with the alternatives. So why doesn't Amazon provide better service? I questioned myself, why do even shop on amazon? I suppose with the other options I won't any longer.",0,0

"Update after 3 months: Still great. Comfortable & fits well. Just the slightest sign of wear on edge near point of attachment. No signs of wear along the band or around the buckle. Very happy. ~~~~~ Original review: I bought the Silver Swirls pattern-- the one with the spirals & I wear it all the time, including workouts. I've had it only for a week, but so far am very happy with it. The pictures accurately show the color & pattern. The pattern wraps over the edge of the band & goes a little way onto the back, so it doesn't look like something that's just stamped on the outside. A week is too short to know, but the pattern seems to be resistant to scraping off or fading. I'm not about to scrape it to find out, but may update the review later. The buckle appears identical to the brand name band that came with the Charge 2. I buckle & unbuckle pretty often to tighten the band for exercise. So far there aren't any wear marks around the buckle. All in all a good deal.",1,0

After 2 pregnancies my boobs are not what they used to be, but based on where these cups fall you would think they were sagging to my belly button!! The straps in the back cut into me and made it hurt to wear, and if I were to cut them to make it a halter my boobs would be out and about. It just fell so awkwardly on me!

"I bought this modem/router about two years ago. At the start it seemed to be ok but for the last year plus I‚Äôve had problems with it dropping the internet. This happens on all my devices both Wi-Fi and wired. The only way to restore service was to do a AC power reset. This was happening once or twice a day. Comcast came out, ran a new coax line from the pedestal to the house and boosted the signal level. Same problem. The Arris Tech guys were great but could not solve the problem. Additionally, I lost the 5G service on three occasions. I had to do a factory reset to restore this. I cannot recommend this modem/router based upon my experiences. I purchased a Netgear AC1900 modem/router. It‚Äôs fantastic. I‚Äôv Had it for over a week with no problems. It‚Äôs faster and the range is greater than the Arris. I read online that other people have had problems with the Arris modem/router connected to Comcast. If you have Comcast internet I do not recommend this Arris modem/router. Get the Netgear, its much more reliable.",0,0

This backpack looks good and performs well. It‚Äôs a great deal especially when you compare it to what backpacks cost now a days. The reason I knocked off a star is because there are just too many straps. There‚Äôs more straps on this bag than I can count. I‚Äôll end up cutting and burning these extra straps off because most of them aren‚Äôt really necessary and just get in the way of opening and closing the bag. Other than that I‚Äôve made this my new school bag for college. There‚Äôs a compartment right in the back of the backpack for my MacBook Pro and all my books fit wel in the pockets provided. The flag also is a great finish to it,1,0

I did a lot of thinking as I read this book. I felt as though I could really picture what the main character was going through. The author did a great job describing the situations and events. I really rooted for the main character and felt her struggles. It seems as though she had to over come a lot to once again over come a lot. She had a group of interesting characters both supporting her and also ones who were against her. Not a plot to be predicted. I highly recommend this book. It grabbed my attention from the first page and had me thinking about it long after. I look forward to reading the author's next book.,1,0

"This piece of equipment is doing a fine job, but it is not a shredder. The plant material needs to be dry before it is stuffed in. Damp leaves or stems will quickly plug up the chute because the blades are sturdy, not razor sharp. As long as plants are dried out, they whiz through and fall neatly into the collection bin. It is easy to load, especially if stems are stiff. I have used it on garden debris, not on twigs or small branches, but it should work equally well on them. One thing I particularly like is the ease of setup. I can chip any size bunch of plants and not wait until I have accumulated a huge pile. It is easy to wheel around, easy to disassemble for cleaning, quick to put back together because no tools are required for the job. I had to get used to the difference between a shredder and a chipper, but I will not have to sharpen this chipper's blades frequently.",1,0

"Before purchasing and after receipt, I watched the video which was very helpful for setup. The stand is well made and all went together as per video.

The support for the phone is adjustable to accommodate for different case thicknesses ‚Ä¶ it is the slight misalignment of the cable that seems the issue. I have set and reset. Not a deal breaker, just takes a bit of finagling to set the phone. All else works well. The only other ""issue"" is ‚Ä¶ there are still 3 cables out the back of the unit. Three white cables. I bought a black unit. I'm trying another stand and am on the lookout for a cable wrangler - probably a solvable problem. If nothing else, I can wrap the cables in black electric tape.

"Overall I am quite satisfied with this purchase but it was not that easy for me to install. I tried installing both ""bells"" into the plugged in transmitter several times without any luck. I was about ready to return it as not working but I thought I would give it one more try and check the batteries in the bells. Voila...there were little plastic tabs sticking out from the battery covers which I pulled on and out came the plastic piece which was covering the battery and stopping it from working. After I removed these pieces of plastic the bells worked just fine and I was completely happy with this purchase. The odd thing is that in the users instruction booklet there is no mention of the plastic over the battery which must be removed for the bell to work. It would have been allot less frustrating if they mentioned this and I didn't think the problem was that I wasn't completing the installation correctly. It's a good product with a wide variety of rings, chimes and tunes you can choose and it's easy to change whenever you want. One thing they ask in rating this bell is how ""weatherproof"" it is. I can't comment on this because it was installed July 5th 2019 and we probably won't be able to comment on how weatherproof it is until next rainy season...probably in November.",1,0

That's what led me to purchase this one, which adds a ""1"" to the numbers you're typing in if you hit any of the numbers close to the 1. It also seems to omit numbers that you feel like you've typed, so the keys on this one are very inconsistent and temperamental. Technically it works, but not great.",0,0

"This purchase is a gift for someone that has been unopened so my review is based on my experiences with the product. My first issue in this experience is pricing. From this listing it costs about store price (still too much), but purchased from the company who makes it it is double for some reason. It's a fun toy, but overpriced since you can make your own slime cheaper and better. I only purchased this for the cute elements and because it was a gift I was willing to spend a little more. I figured even if the slime was a failure, at least there was some fun opening and having the keychains. I also purchased other items as further backup in case it doesn't turn out right. The product itself has a fun blind bag element with cute keychains and mystery scents which besides the marketing is probably the best part. I already mentioned that was enough of a fallback that even if the slime comes out dissapointing, the kid will still have fun with it. The slime quality with these is very hit or miss. Sometimes it comes out well and others it does not. Sometimes it gets better with time and others it deteriorates. This product is a gamble and the only thing making it almost worth it are the little blind box toys. I'm sure this young kid will have fun with it, but all factors included it isn't worth returning and also not worth rebuying.",1,0

Great to refurbish a compacted lawn. Assembly is a pain but this is heavy duty and not cheaply built. Local hard ware store visit is needed to buy blocks for weighting down. It tore up my clay perfectly with deep plugs. Down side is getting on and off the lawn mower to raise/lower the times when coming to a driveway or sidewalk.,1,0

I‚Äôve had my outdoor nest camera on my front porch for one year now. My subscription just ran out which is $100 per year. The camera is pretty useless without the subscription. When you have the subscription I can distinguish people from Pats or motion of trees blowing in the wind and sounds versus voices. Now that my subscription is over it can‚Äôt do any of those things is just notifies me anytime there‚Äôs motion and it can‚Äôt distinguish. It doesn‚Äôt even routine video for five minutes so you can go back and look and see who was on your porch because by time you receive the notification there already gone so the live feed is really ineffective unless someone hangs out in front of the camera for an extended period. So if you‚Äôre comfortable with being stuck with a subscription every year at $100 per camera then it is a decent camera but it‚Äôs useless without the subscription. I‚Äôm looking into other cameras where I don‚Äôt have to have a subscription.,0,0

"I bought this little mixer to, well, mix two audio channels to one output and have the option for a convenient headphone port on my desk. When I first hooked everything up, I had serious issues with an audio feedback buzzing constantly. I did some poking around and thought it was the cheap audio cables I purchased. I bought a whole new set of shielded cables to try and correct the problem. It is no longer constant, but frequently pops up when I power it on. You can work around it by replugging in the cables and eventually it will go away. But this is only true while the input 1 and input 2 levels are at the same volume. If you adjust them the feedback gets worse the further they are apart, if you have one at max and one at min - the feedback is so bad it drowns out the audio. I gave it two stars because it technically works, but a simple 2 into 1 audio connection would do the same thing and save you $30. I would not recommend this to anybody and eventually it will go in the trash.",0,0

Since I paid $20 for it, I do not find it reasonable to pay shipping to return it. I will just use it as a watch until it dies.

Phone arrived beyond dead and took forever to turn on. Appears to function fine. Came with a case and screen protector which masked the issues. The phone is in TERRIBLE shape. It looks like someone threw it in a box of gravel and shook it for an hour. I have never seen a phone with so many scratches and flaws to the body. I‚Äôm scared to take the screen protector off because of what I‚Äôll find under there. This is not a full refurbish. This is a factory reset and maybe a quick function test.,0,0
"I love these shelves but I was pissed when I went to put them up. The metal washer covers don't fit over all the plastic washer. So, I was stuck leaving the ugly black plastic washers showing.

"I'm never buying pads again! I've been using these for months now and I absolutely love them. They're super durable and easy to clean, great for people with sensitive skin or who have allergies.

The money you spend now saves you ever having to spend on pads again.",1,0
Exactly what you need to cut & strip fresh herbs and leafy greens. Easy to use and clean. Great safety tab that allows you to retract blades. Super easy to clean. Much better quality than others I‚Äôve used & broken. Plastic could be a tad thicker to make it last longer - but at this price it can‚Äôt be beat that‚Äôs my only quasi-complaint. Still ranks as one of the best I‚Äôve found after purchasing & breaking 2 other brands previous to this.,1,0

""Cave of Bones"" was pretty good and brought back fond memories of the books, the characters, and the Southwest country... I enjoyed that one, so I tried this one (the author's first effort). But it's pretty weak. Shallow characterization; repetitive; some too-obvious clues/details. Oh well. Somewhere between this book and ""Cave of Bones"" her style and plotting must have improved, so maybe I'll try a few others.",0,0

I have tried it 3x for smoking meat and it has failed in this way about 10 times. each time the only way i can figure it out is to notice that the temp stays the same for a long time, like 20 minutes or so, and then I must power cycle the device and force close and reopen the app. After i do this it starts working again.

It is so easy to use. I just plugged it into my electrical outlet and it works just like that. It even has a small blue LED light, which looks quite bright at night. One downside is that it would take up 2 slot on your outlet as the device is quite long (about 4-inch long and 2-inch wide). It is also effective for small area. If you have a big house, they recommend to have one for each room, which will add up quite a lot of money. Overall, it works well for my small apartment.",1,0
"I bought this item to store dirty clothes. It's good to take to the laundromat. Just don't put too much weight on it. I put a heavier load of dirty clothes, than usual, on it once and the handles ripped off. Luckily, it has two handles (shown in photo) so it's still usable. It CAN hold a lot of clothes because it is deep and the material stretches if you plan on not transporting it. However, if you plan to take the hamper laundromat don't overload it. Overall, I found this order very useful because it comes in a pack of two, so I can easily organize my whites and colors when doing laundry. When I only need to use one, I can easily fold the other and it does not take much space to store. I rent a small room, so I wanted something that wouldn't take as much space and is affordable.

So after playing with this watch all day I have to say not bad. Not great but not bad. I don‚Äôt like the fact that you have to remove the wrist band to charge the watch. Also that when lift to see the time doesn‚Äôt always work. When you use the watch to take a picture with your phone it doesn‚Äôt show you what the camera sees. It locates your phone with sound but if you use your phone to find your watch the watch vibrates which is useless. The other functions are ok but are a little glitchy. In the end It‚Äôs a nice cheap alternative for a child who wants smart watch.,1,0
"This product is great when it works, which is RARELY. We have attempted to record multiple soccer games and lacrosse games and have ended up with some videos of the grass, a bunch of 0 byte video clips on the card, and that is about it. For a $700 product I would expect it to work. The memory card is one of their suggested cards, and we have applied all the product updates that were available. We have used it for streaming which worked, but that would be all I would recommend it for at this point. We have other friends that have them and all have had issues with theirs as well.

"Lord was just awesome. I don't know what it was about the way his dialogue was written, but I really loved him. Elle was pretty quirky and fun as well. What I would have loved to have read in this story, however, would have been more backstory on Lord and how his upbringing affected him. There were references to it and in the story before about his brother it was even mentioned that Lord was somehow messed up from childhood. Yet I didn't really see that come out in his character. He actually seemed very grounded and mature...which is a good thing, but I would have loved to see his character given more dimension.",1,0
Item arrived barely not expired on bottle....smell and taste like SHIT! not like watermelon mint for damn sure. ive had a million protein shakes and this is by far the worst. i dont even think it tastes the way it initially did when it came in fresh out the assembly.

I really like the concept of this belt and how it works. As a plus size person I find this belt easy to use and tighten. But I am giving a two star review for two reasons. 1) the buckle is very heavy for its size.

This product is worth the purchase and does what it says. Perfect rice every time and very easy to operate (remember to hold your finger down for a second or so to get the proper feedback on the touch display). I'm giving it 4 stars because cleaning it isn't so simple. The pot that sits within the product is great. It's non-stick and easy to clean. My issue is with the lid that closes down to seal the rice/food. I've looked up how to remove and clean these components on YouTube and other sites without helpful results. Reading their instruction manual offers the most minimal assistance and is rather insulting. What I've had to do is wipe it clean with a rag on the counter with soap and then wipe the soap off with a clean rag over and over until it's clean. I'd prefer a removable top that can be washed in the dishwasher and was a little dumbfounded when I realized it didn't work that way considering the price compared to cheaper $20 units I've used from places like Target. If you purchase it you will see what I mean. If I'm wrong and there is a way then I still blame the manufacturer for not making it more obvious.,1,0
"Over all, a nice dog house, but contrary to what the description says, the roof does not come off.

That said, the doorway is huge and I don‚Äôt think it would be difficult to wash it out that way. The assembly was easy enough by following the pictures. Although a couple of screw holes didn‚Äôt line up perfectly, these were not much of a problem. I doubt that the house would be completely water proof - maybe - but I‚Äôm using it under a patio, so that is not an issue for me. I wish there was a door flap available.",1,0

"I purchased this for my wife in October, 2017. At the time, we were in the middle of relocating and living in a hotel. I couldn't get this scale to connect to the Wifi in the hotel.

Every time I try, I get the error message. Even when I am 10' away from the Wifi unit. I followed the YouTube setup video with no success. When I purchased the unit, I thought it would connect directly to my wife's phone (like Bluetooth). Instead, this scale uses the Wifi router to communicate to the phone. This system is limited to the router connection...which is usually not close to the bedroom unlike a cell phone! I wouldn't recommend this scale to anyone because of the Wifi connection. Instead, please look at systems that use Bluetooth for communication. I am replacing this with a Bluetooth connection scale.",0,0

"The instructions tell you to push the plug up through the hole in the baffle and ""Make sure it is securely in place."" HOW??? It is designed so that the baffle simply sits loosely on the plug, so that it can be pushed up by any critter or the slightest wind.

It took me over an hour to do a half-baked job of getting them screwed in so as to secure the baffle to the plug. It is a complete PITA.

Additionally, received an entirely different brand of unit, similar in look but not what I actually ordered.

Without further email exchange I was given a $10 credit toward the unit cost of ~$30 - appreciated but not what I asked for so now I've spent only $20 on an item that is going unused (until I can locate some online user instructions.

I picked this book because the story had potential. Prologue was well written and gives you that thrill of anticipation for the next page.

"We've all been lied to, that's a fact. Andy Andrews shows us the depth we have sunk to by the lies.

Don't like the whole silk nylon feel of this item way too hot for summer and uncomfortable for something that's supposed to clean to you again very small not for thicker women if you have a flat stomach you maybe to pull this off Constable however it is a hot material so I would recommend wearing it at night when you're going out or something is not something that you would think of cloth that you can wear during a summer day and just don't some cute flip flops it's very hot very tight and weird material,0,0

You want an HONEST answer? I just returned from UPS where I returned the FARCE of an earring set to Amazon. It did NOT look like what I saw on Amazon.

This was extremely easy to use which was something that I was worried about when it came to purchasing it. I didn't want something overly complicated and hard to clean since that seems to be the common theme with these types of products. I was able to crush the garlic without a problem and it moved along with the crusher piece. The silicone was also extremely easy to clean so I am overall pleased and happy with the purchase. If you don't want something overly complicated or hard to clean then this can be an affordable option to go with. Everyone is always looking for items that make cooking easier and this is where you can find it! I love my garlic press and will definitely check into the other kitchen items from this company because I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and product. I did however have a bit of confusion in the beginning because the instructions were not clear so I googled. You guys might have to google too if you've never used a garlic press before.,1,0

"This hair is good but I had a few issues. Pros: The shipping was super-fast. I received it in two days with Prime and it was a weekend when I ordered. (Sat. got it on Mon). It is soft and very manageable. Holds curls very well. Does not have such a bad smell. Cons: It sheds a lot. Straight out the pack just running my hand through there was shedding. After I was washed it even more shedding. There was rust in the hair. Yes, that‚Äôs right RUST. Perhaps it‚Äôs from being stored for a long time but the combs were rusty. Even some parts of the lace had rust on it. This is very disappointing but you get what you pay for. I had a wedding to go to last minute so I thoroughly washed it and even disinfected it with Lysol. I also bought some wig combs to sew them in myself, instead of using the rusty one attached to the wig. Lol, Desperate times calls for desperate measures. I knew I would not be able to get my money back after cutting the lace and sewing clips in so I didn‚Äôt bother sending it back. The pics here. The hair is beautiful when styled and holds curls very well. To be honest, if this hair didn‚Äôt shed or have rust in it, I would rate it 5 stars. Unfortunately, paying $100 for hair I do not expect it to be rusty. I had to buy separate wig combs and sew them in myself so I don‚Äôt get the rust in my own hair and scalp. That was doing a lot. Hope you guys have better luck than I did. This hair really has the potential to be great though.",1,0

I love Soda product! These ran a little small for me! Wish they worked because I really liked them!,1,0
I did have to iron it for some time carefully to get the creases to a point of not being a major issue. In addition I used thumb tacks on the wall to smooth it out. It looks pretty good for a cheap backdrop for a photo booth.,1,0
These were useless. Probably one of the worst $20 purchases I‚Äôve ever made in my life. They booted up one time and then I left the room and came back ready to use them and they would never turn on again. I hate them.,0,0
Took a chance on a warehouse deal and lost. It said like new minor cosmetic on front turned out to be stickers on front and a broken speaker Connection in the back making Channel 1 useless.,0,0
Discreet and cute! Purrrfect little travel companion. It is a little more powerful than expected! Lots of different speed/ massage patterns. The charge lasts a long time! I like that it had a soft texture and I'd waterproof!,1,0

"Worked nicely for 2 weeks but now it doesn't always charge. When it did charge, it was as fast as using a normal USB cable but usually 20-30 minutes slower than a fast charge cable directly plugged into the phone.

"When I first saw this I thought it was beautiful, BUT it smelled SO BAD. At first I thought it was the smell of leather, but many pointed out that is was a MOLD smell. It never went away, so I had to return it. PLUS, the pockets for the credit cards are too big. The credit cards slide all the way down, the tips don't show so you have no idea what card is where and very difficult to get out.

"These are very reasonably priced, and while they aren't an especially convincing wood texture when you look at them up close, they do look a lot classier than basic white plastic blinds. I ordered one to see how it looked and now that know they're alright I'm ordering more for some of the other windows in my house. I did knock off a star because the instructions are really annoyingly unclear and while mine are stable and working fine I'm still not sure I installed them exactly as intended. If you've never put up blinds before I'd recommend finding a tutorial on youtube or something, that's what I resorted to after the first 20 minutes of scratching my head.",1,0

From the very beginning it did not feel like the other tomb raider games. Gameplay is brutal in that controls aren‚Äôt smart in knowing what direction you‚Äôre trying to take. Leaving you to fall to your death in the most redundant ways. Puzzles are hard but not in a logical sense. I have not enjoyed this game. I do not plan on finishing it. The story is lackluster as well which is the main reason I play games.,0,0

Ive just had the second one fail on me.....they last about 1-2 years then the LCD starts to fail.

This said....when its working the la Crosse unit is very functional and stylish.....this said they've now withdrawn it from their line....i assume because they kept failing/return rates.,0,0

"It might not be something you should use by itself, there needs to be a stretch and strengthening routine coupled to it, but I will say, that I have been suffering from low back pain, from a bulging disc, and this brace takes a lot of pressure away from my discs by modifying my posture. I can stand for longer, I can sit for longer, and I don‚Äôt even feel the constant presence of pain in the area while I wear it. Even though this targets my upper back and shoulders, it has provided great relief to my lower back. It didn‚Äôt solve my issue, but it helps a lot.",1,0
"I'm very happy with these scissors. They are small (as most have stated) but are super sharp. The finger slots are great and feel like a smooth soft rubber. I didn't want to have large scissors dangling and getting caught on things as I like to wear my scissors on a badge pulley on my waste band for quick use in the ER. These fit the bill for cutting fabric tape, bandages and even clothing items. The bent edge makes it easy to get them in where I need. I'm glad I got them.",1,0
"With a brand like Little Tikes, I am shocked at the quality. The handle bar is very loose and wiggles when you try to push. This makes it challenging to pivot when needing to turn. There is also a defect on the handle where the plastic is super sharp. The size of the seat barely fits my one year old and does not look comfortable. I had the Step2 car for my daughter and am upset I didn‚Äôt order the same for my son. The only reason I didn‚Äôt was because I liked the idea of the canopy!",0,0

The fastening slots are open at the bottom, plus they are small, so lacing a seat belt through is pointless. Comes off immediately.

I'm giving 2 stars because it is sturdy, lightweight, and inexpensive- but it's fastening system means it is not secure in your car.",0,0

For the price of these leggings I would say they are not good quality. They are very see through. Even if you take your hand and stretch the fabric you can see directly through it. These leggings are extremely long. I am 5'6 and normally need a long inseam and these are much too long for me. They bag and roll behind the knee with the extra material and don't lay right since they are too long. I would also suggest to size down since they run big in my opinion.,0,0

"Cheap garbage thin plastic. Tiny dust collection bin that contains a filter, makes sense BUT pet hair doesn't want to come out. Have to stick your fingers into the open collection bin to out it loose. That's messy and gross. Hose/wand removal from handle body is awkward and the cheap plastic construction makes you baby it. Hose suction is less than impressive anyway. The handle is difficult to lock into the upright storage position and regularly, when you think it is locked up, it isn't, and therefore falls hard to the floor. It steers like a dream! ....yeah that doesn't make up for its shortfalls. Not even close really. Returned this piece of junk and bought a Shark with a nice big dust collection bin/cylinder.",0,0

"The problem is any missing instructions what to do with the product after arrival. It smells horribly, it colours all water yellow. From web I found that I should soak it for a long time (in my case I soaked it for 3 days replacing water several times). This removes significant amount of colouring and smell. Then you should use it empty. You will see how much yellow the water under the steamer is. If it is still quite a lot and the steamer smells, keep soaking, if it is just tinted with yellow and the smell is very faint, steam empty steamer several times and soak after each steaming. (i do not know if the instructions are correct but this is what I found by trial and error. Finally, when you cook food, always put baking paper under it. Especially if you steam fish. After steaming, I suggest soaking for half an hour in water. Soaking = immerse fully in water.",1,0

"I've had the original Stylo as well as the Stylo 2, Stylo 2 V and the Stylo 2 Plus. Clearly I really liked the Stylos considering the fact that every time a new one came out, I purchased it. Never because one had issues or broke, just because I wanted to stay upgraded and ""in the loop"" and I did. Out of all of those phone's, not once did I ever had any problems with the phone's themselves. When I made this purchase for the Stylo 3 through Virgin Mobile, I just knew everything would go smoothly once I got the phone and set it up but I was very wrong in assuming that. This phone had so many issues that it honestly shocked me how the previous Stylos were so wonderful. I was never even able to sucessfully have this phone transferred to my Virgin Mobile account. I messed around for a little less than a week with this phone. I searched for information on the internet and made various calls desperately trying to give the Stylo 3 the benefit of the doubt hoping it was just me doing something wrong but sadly I wasted a lot of time doing so because it was 100% the phone having all the problems I didn't want to admit. I hate the fact that I have to give a Stylo such a horrible rating and review but I was extremly disappointed with this phone. Hopefully LG ups their game and can improve the future Stylos if there are any but this was a huge BUST. On the bright side, the return and my refund went smoothly but that's about it.",0,0

"Crayola 12 count colored pencils hold up well to the pressure on the paper. The tip does not break easily and the colors are very vivid as expected with this brand. The downside is that the pencils are the standard size and not really great for young elementary and preschool age. A smaller (length pencil) would have been better. I don't feel like sharpening the pencil all the way down for each one, so it works well enough for now. This brand consistently makes good coloring items and this is no exception. I just think I would have spent a little more time researching the length of the pencil in the future.

"Yeah, that's about it. The nipple pieces are so tiny that at best, they are fit for feeding baby mice or maybe baby gerbils. I can't use them for my two little, five week old puppies. They weigh 1.3 and 1.5 pounds respectively, and this teensy nipple is too small that they would even recognize this as something from which to suckle. Other use I can think of for these would be a 5 - 10 year old girl, who wants to bottle feed her dolls. She would love these! I can't imagine how the makers can claim that all professional nurses use them for new born animals. I don't believe it! I am going to buy some real baby bottles with some real nipples.",0,0

This case is very attractive. It holds and secures my phone nicely. I love the way it looks. Very classy. I have a black j7 so this case matches it perfectly. The downsides are the inside card holder. It's a very delicate mesh that rips easily resulting in cards falling out when using the phone not good ! so you have to be very careful not to overload and rip the sides. The magnet could be more magnetic it doesn't hold the case closed very well. The strap is very thin I had a sturdier black strap that I use on it instead of the one that comes with it. I am on my second one and although they do not hold up too long i like the look and the fact its not heavy. My first case lasted about 3 months before it ripped and looked a little worn around the corners.,1,0

They are separating at the seam and the band of grit is coming loose from the belt. I don't know if somewhere along the line they got wet,or they are not rated for the speed of a simple dremel band rotary tool. The cheapest single speed tools on the market still go at the 25,000 rpm range ,( which was the speed I was using).

"My 97 year-old Dad could not use any phone but this one. His vision does not allow him to see the numbers on the buttons, so my daughter made up a large print chart with names that correspond to the buttons. It was easy to program and set up. It is so easy for him to lift the receiver and press one button to reach me. The only problem is that others, such as the aides at his assisted living facility, do not understand how to use it when it is on one-button program mode. I would have liked the amplified audio to be even louder, but that is mostly a problem because my father won't wear his hearing aids. This really helped solve a big problem for us, and I would buy it again, for sure.",1,0

"Please read all the reviews regarding installation difficulty. To start with, this is not a one person job. It requires a team of two, with two ladders to accomplish. And patience. I suggest partnering with someone other than your significant other, unless you desire a divorce. Upon receiving this item, promptly head to Lowes or a hardware store. You will need to purchase: 2 3"" #6 machine screws to replace the ones which are far too short. You will also need two good sized washers and two wing nuts. Don't be too concerned, your #6 wing nuts to fit the screws will look tiny. The photo is from another reviewer where I got the idea. The additional installation tip, is that once we had the mounting bracket in place, we tied a piece of chef's twine to each screw, with plenty of length. We ran the strings through the holes on the backing of the light fixture. We used these strings to help guide the light fixture onto the screws, and then secured with the washers and wing nuts after snipping off the string. SUCH a pain and hassle, but for $90, it looks good and works fine. Also, this one comes with a glass diffuser instead of plastic which I assume will hold up better over time and maybe look better too. I wouldn't say ""don't buy this"", but I would be forewarned. I hope this review is helpful! Good luck!",0,0

I went to wipe it off and with the sweat came due as well.... TALK ABOUT A BUMBER! So I took a wet cloth and wiped it... Just about all of it came off.... now after it was all off, the areas were a little darker than they were before... but clearly still not fixed. so I'm not sure if I need to get a darker color to just do a single coat or what? but I do know that I dont wosh to waste my money again.",0,0

"These worked reasonably well for a while... I actually used them non-stop (except to charge) for 5 days after I got them. This is my first pair of bluetooth earbuds and I was impressed at the battery life. They easily lasted 8+ hours, and charged quickly. After the initial 5 day spurt of use I would only use them intermittently afterwards, and they continued to work fine and held a charge when not in use well as long as they were powered off obviously. The downsides to these... the volume was not all that loud. Sometimes I was using them in louder environments (at a race track, on a plane) and I pretty much had to have my computer or phone at max volume to hear them easily. I was not listening to music most of the time, typically talk radio or shows so this could have contributed to why I had to have the volume maxed the entire time. Along those same lines, the noise isolation is nonexistent. So that really doesn't help matters when the volume does not go that loud. The real problem came when after 4 months of ownership they just stopped working. They will no longer connect to any device for longer than a second or two before they immediately disconnect. I've contacted Optoma for a warranty replacement so we will see how that goes. So far it has been 3 days and I still have not received my RMA slip. GIven the relatively low amount of use these saw I am very disappointed that they failed so early. But the accessories they come with are excellent, I really liked the pouch as I could keep it clipped to the exterior of my travel bag so the headphones were always in easy reach when I needed them. The pouch could use a little mesh pocket inside to keep the charging cable contained, but that is another minor gripe about the whole setup in general.",0,0

"What should I say to William Painter? I ordered the sunglasses to Germany. The first thing I received was a pair of bent sunglasses. They complained that I had to pay the costs for the return myself, they are about $40. I got a new one, it has been used before. You can see from the fact that the cloth was not properly folded and the case dirty. I also had to pay the costs for the customs myself, about 60 $. So the sunglasses cost me 100 $ more. Pro: good glasses, looks good, fits well. I can't say anything about that. Contra: I find it a cheek that I got used sunglasses, especially after the first pair of glasses was bent and clearly had a mistake and my ass was sweetened by William Painter.

"- Great quality desk - I would have expected to pay much more for the quality of the powder coating and the finish - Easy to put together - comes with all necessary tools (took 1 hour in total) - Great looking desk - very professional (I got the gray and black) - 60"" Wide surface leaves room for paperwork, etc - Cranks very easily to the fully up position (less than a minute) - Good quality casters allow you to move the desk when needed (also add to total height) - I am 6' tall and the height is perfect (though close to the top of the range)",1,0
"This little guy works right out of the box. No formatting required. There is a music folder already on the device so, just drag and drop your music in that folder or you can re-create the folder and name it something else. Once the music is on there, using the interface you can choose different ways to access that music (shuffle, accessing the folders directly or playing all the songs). The device itself is very light, think and can easily fit in your pocket. Not much to it really. It comes with a cable that allows you to connect to the computer to be able to put music, video or books on the device. It is also used to charge the device. It comes with headphones as well, which are pretty cheap but get the job done. My only gripe with the device is that even though it is light, it does feel like I can break this thing if I sneeze. Doesn't feel durable. But, all in all, great device for the prices.",1,0

"Based on the reviews and the seller‚Äôs advice, I sized up to a M when I normally wear an XS/S.

Not only for children but adults as there is so much history to learn about. love that they show color photos of a scene during the book. So much history: how the Santa letter came about over the years, the origins of Santa. Each section of years has a summary and toy terminology and the charm of children, living history section and a don't miss area before it gets into the letters. Amazing to learn when tinker toys were invented among other toys that we in our 60's remember. So many fond memories over the years, what a treasure this book is.",1,0

"Really cool concept when it comes to karaoke-ing. I love karaoke so this mic immediately piqued my interests. I think the overall design is good - the rose gold is a nice touch. It's also a standard design that I've been seeing on all other options related to this kind of microphone. For the uninitiated, the way this works is it simultaneously acts as 1) a personal microphone 2) a music streamer / speaker and 3) a voice recorder. Altogether, you have a 3-in-1 device that amplifies your voices and music and records everything that comes out. There's no music in the mic itself though. It has a bluetooth connector so you sync it to your phone and download a karaoke app that can send the karaoke songs to the mic. Or you can even sync your Spotify app. Note that the mic doesn't work with every app unfortunately. The mic comes with different options to adjust the volume level of the music and your voice (separately too!) and even has an option to adjust the level of echo so you actually sound like you're in a karaoke room. Some things I would like to see future improvements on are: 1) there's some annoying feedback that doesn't seem to go away regardless of how far I distance my phone from the mic. If you've figured this out, I'd love to know! 2) the option switches at the middle of the mic is clunky. I'm a sucker for minimalism so it be great if future products can make the design sleeker. 3) support for more karaoke apps Finally, because the sound comes out of this mic directly, and not through a flatscreen or central living room speaker system, it's not as fun in a party setting. If the manufacturer can somehow integrate this into a larger party karaoke ecosystem, that would make this infinity more enjoyable.",1,0

These need time to recover from shipping...like a few hours to adjust to your room and show similar readings.

"This book was helpful for my review; however, I failed on the test. There were tons of practice questions for each chapter, but they are very easy to the point that you don‚Äôt really need to buy this book. When I took the TEAS, the questions on the actual TEAS were very different. Some reviewers said that the question on the book were similar on the actual TEAS, but they were wrong. I studied the cardiovascular system intensively, and there is no one single question about the heart at all. The English portion on this book is very different on the actual TEAS. In the book, it focuses on grammar and spelling. On the actual TEAS, it is more on ‚Äòif the sentence is written correctly?‚Äô Overall, I don‚Äôt think that this book is worth buying. Like I said, the questions on the book are very easy. They are more on common sense. Compare to the actual TEAS exam, you will have to think and reread the question again.",0,0

"I bought this as a tracker to use while I swim, and I didn't even get a proper chance to try it. First off, it's not water resistant and it is not recommended to use while swimming per the instruction manual. Second, it doesn't come with a charger. Instead, it suggests to use a USB plug or computer. Fine, we have lots of those around. When I try to get it into the port to charge it, however, it launches right back out. I'm not sure if there's something not compatible or if this is just poorly made, but I'm not going to sit and hold my device in while it charges. Lastly, the app keeps popping up ads, even when it's closed. Ads popped up while I was sending a text, which is very concerning. I then closed down all active apps on my phone, and saw yet another ad when I went to check the time 20 minutes later. Horrible product, I guess I get what I paid for...",0,0

"Buena funda y a buen precio. La he usado en las ocasiones que voy a campings con bastante polvo y me ha hecho su servicio al 100%. Cubre hasta abajo el coche, por todos los laterales y sin tocar en suelo en ning√∫n punto. Cuenta con gomas el√°sticas en su parte anterior y posterior para que quede sujeta al coche, aunque no est√° de menos agarrar tambi√©n la cinta que pasa por debajo de coche y las laterales que se atan a cada una de las ruedas. En mi caso, en d√≠as pocos ventosos, con la principal, la que pasa por debajo del coche, ha sido suficiente para que no se suelte y entre algo de aire entre el coche y la tela. En cuanto a la impermeabilidad me parece que es muy justa, resistir√° peque√±as lluvia y roc√≠o, empezando a entrar agua al de poco tiempo, aunque lo importante en mi caso, el polvo y otras suciedades, si que lo evita. En retrovisores y laterales cuenta con telas cosidas reflectantes para mejorar la visibilidad. No son de muy alta calidad pero hacen su cometido. Hablando de las costuras decir que est√°n correctas, no est√°n estupendamente rematadas pero las telas que componen la funda no se sueltan y para el precio y uso que tiene la funda no pretend√≠a que tuviera m√°s calidad y detalle.

Would have appreciated as much attention in the story as had been displayed years prior . Where the author had .great story lines and interactions, they have become shortened and far more time added to sexual interactions. Far more erotica than story,which is of course the easier route.

Only reason I gave a four is because putting a wrist strap on the same end as the electrodes makes no sense.

"This is a basic puffer coat. If you are seeking a basic coat, then this coat will meet expectations. The coat arrived in a vacuum sealed bag so it needs to be hung up for a few days to let wrinkles come out and to ""puff up"" a bit. I am 5 ft 6 inches and the coat is knee length on me. I ordered 2+ sizes up due to other comments and past experience, and the coat is probably a bit larger than needed. However, with heavier sweater or sweatshirt, it should be fine. There are no cuffs on the sleeves so I will likely add those later. The hood functions, but no ties on it. The front zipper works. There are no vents in the side or back for added movement, but with the larger size, I should have plenty of room. There are two pockets at my waist (may be higher or lower on you). There are no trims or styling details-- it is a BASIC COAT. For the price, I think it is fine. I did wear it on a windy day, but not cold. I could not feel the wind, so I feel that is a good sign. However, I am curious how it will perform in the colder temps and in the rain/snow (supposed to be resistent). Overall, I am pleased.

"Bought this as a humidifier, the ""air cleaning"" part is actually false advertising; depending on how hard your water is, sediment does accumulate in the bottom, but none of that is any dust in your home unless you live in a coal mine or something. As a humidifier, I would rate it as slightly less effective than a wick type humidifier with the same fan size. The advantage is that it doesn't consume wicks. Given the additional cost of the unit, you probably have to run it for about 5 years to make the difference up. It does have a fairly large water capacity for its size, since the 'tank' is integral to the unit, and it's low power (although no better than a wick type). It is also fairly easy to clean, although the plastic disks can't really be serviced since the disk unit can't be disassembled. However, for German engineering, the build quality isn't great. I've had mine for a year now, which would be about six months of cold weather run time, and the unit has developed a very annoying rattling noise from the fan assembly. My guess would be the fan bearings, so I'm just waiting for complete failure to happen here. As noted by someone else, any repairs are almost equivalent to just buying a new wick humidifier. tl; dr - not worth the extra cost, you are better off with a wick humidifier.",0,0

"As per the instructions I charged the batteries fully before the first use. This took 14 hours which is much longer than the suggested three hour charge time. After the charging was complete I paired the socks with the included remote control. Pairing each battery was actually pretty easy, once of the nicest things about these socks. The socks fit my feet well. You can easily feel where the wires are but it only took a couple of minutes before you forgot they were there. Once the sock were on I connected the batteries and tucked them away in their respective pouches. The using the remote I turned the socks on High. After an hour I pulled each battery out of the pouch to check the indicator light, sure enough the light showed that each battery was on high but I couldn't feel any warmth on my feet. And this was on High. I kept the socks on for four hours, at about the third hour I started to feel a hint of heat. The reason these socks didn't meet my expectations and received a two star rating is because of the exceptionally long charge time as well as it taking three hours before I felt any hint of heat. Even at hour four there was very little heat on the High setting. I didn't test Medium or Low.",0,0

The alarm went off at the smoldering stage and he wasn't home but we heard the alarm, we busted in and saved the place with a large fire extinguisher.

"I purchased this lamp to supplement the light my new vegetable seedlings were getting from the window. I love many of the features of these lights. Pros: First, they clamp easily onto my shelf, and bend to many positions allowing me to make changes as my plants grow. The lights are cool to the touch, and haven't cause harm even when touching the plants. I believe my veggies have benefited from the lights. The lights are dimmable, but I use the strongest setting only. I have not made use of the timer, preferring to turn them on and off myself. I can see this feature as useful in an office setting with houseplants or if on vacation Cons: I do not believe these lights are strong enough to be the primary light source for nursery plants. The lights are small! When the lights burn out, I will have to buy a whole new unit.",1,0
"The plant shipped relatively quickly but without a heat pack. It shipped on a relatively warm day (45 degrees Fahrenheit) so it wasn't the biggest deal, but still.

But sometimes when going in that room, the ozone smell is a bit excessive. But, it does produce ozone, just like it says. And it is adjustable, but I would prefer it could be turned down a bit more.",1,0

"1 of the fans sounded out of balance out of the box. The speed controls are really wonky -- If you dial them to 100% the fans will shut off, so you need to turn it to 100% then dial it back slowly until the come back on. Build quality is mediocre, but this seems to be par for most of these types of product at this price point. The feet for holding the laptop up when it's inclined have snapped off a few times... They go back in, but it happens enough to be annoying. On a positive note, this has ideal fan placement for laptops that intake air from vents located near the top of the laptop. Many other coolers have fans toward the middle and provide very little additional airflow to a laptop with such a cooling configuration.",0,0

"My lamps arrived yesterday and I opened and set them up today. I ordered five of these lamps and have already noticed issues with a few of them. One has an arm that is so loose I can only use it clamped to a horizontal surface. If I clamp it to a vertical surface, the arm continues to droop far past where I want it to be. I tried to tighten the nut where it is attached to the clamp, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. Another has an arm that droops towards the lamp end, but the fitting is tight, so it appears the flexible arm itself is just a bit weak. Lastly, a third lamp has flickered as I adjusted the direction of the bulb, the bulb is screwed all the way in too, so it is not loose in the socket. So far, I‚Äôm not impressed with these lamps but hope they serve my plants well and ultimately the lamps have a long life. I‚Äôll update my review in a month or so, once I‚Äôve had time to evaluate if they‚Äôre truly beneficial for my plants.",0,0

As can be expected, there is much banter and interaction between officers and with those they arrest. This is a standalone novel; however, it is basically an introduction to the series.

"Let me first explain why I chose this model over others. I don't like the vent clips - I do not think prolonged exposure to hot or cold direct forced air is good for the phone. Dash mounts (even the magnetic ones) require putting adhesive on your dash - no thank you. Windshield mounts are hit and miss in my experience, they either work really well and won't come down. others you hit a bump and the damn thing falls off the windshield. So I figured this may be a viable option. Perhaps if I were a foot taller (I am 5'4""). If placed where they suggest it impedes my view of the road. My best bet is in the middle, where it is slightly harder to reach, but at least if I'm using GPS it's easier to view than it is sitting in my cupholder or lap.",0,0

"My friend recommended the mask of this line so I bought that, this conditioner, and the all in one milk. I cannot speak for the effectiveness of the product because the smell was just not tolerable. You know that musty smell old buildings use in female restrooms to try to mask the smell of *ladies* but it just turns out as this sour, chemical, kind of musty grandma smell? Ya that's all I can think of when I smell this. You know different strokes different folks so maybe you'll like the smell. My friend said it can help even the most damaged hair, so if you don't care about scent then no worries. I know natural products aren't going to smell as pretty as some synthetic ones but I feel like more and more natural lines just care less since it will sell anyway and so now everything just smells like playdough. I've lost a few favorite lines to them changing the formula to cheaper ingredients. I don't know if that's the case here or if this is a fake (which I called Davines and they said it isn't) but this smells like Y U C K and I had to return it.",0,0
"We ordered this set for our Switch because it was a good balance between the price of wired controllers (cheap) and functionality of wireless.

So much rumble. Some kind of setting to turn it down would be great. 2) the binding procedure was a little weird, but well-explained in the (marginally) translated instructions. Would definitely recommend if you need a couple extra controllers for when friends come over. For a daily driver or to be more pro, some of the more expensive options might be better.",1,0

I like this series. The main characters are unusual and very damaged from a terrible childhood. Will is an excellent investigator but due to a disability he believes he is illiterate. Slaughter does a very good job showing how people with dyslexia learn ways to hide their limitations. It will be interesting to see how these characters play out in the future. I understand that Slaughter brings some of the characters from the Grant County series to this series. The crimes are brutal. I'm sure this is a good representation of what police come across in their career. The procedural is well done and kept me interested from start to finish. I'm looking forward to reading more of this series soon.,1,0

"I'm have thick curly hair that I have to apply a lot of heat to just to get it semi-straight. And because I use only coconut oil it tends to leave my hair with a cooked kind of smell. This spray works! I sprayed my hair all over one time and it immediately cancelled the coconut odor out of my hair. The scent smells so nice and it's lightweight. I could smell it for about an hour or two and then it faded, but It totally canceled all the odor out of my hair...no more cooked smell. And I can use a little bit every day every time I curl my hair and it doesn't dry it out or change the texture whatsoever.",1,0

Definitely not what I expected! Now to say this I usually use the Doc Johnson Seven Wonders vibrator which is awesome I think they stop making it so I had to find an alternative so I found this one the price was decent read the reviews you know looked at everybody else reviews and base it off of that so hey I ordered okay so I had it for a few weeks now wanted to give an honest review and honestly... I hate it I think it's more or less the design of the applicator I don't really like the fatness of it I really like to sleep slim ones that to me they really stimulate your clit a whole lot better but hey that's just my opinion I went by it again that we looking for alternative hope this helps anybody on the quest to find a good bullet LOL LOL,0,0

I have used this item daily for a month now. I have used up to 160 lb of resistance without a problem. It is very sturdy and a perfect length. The grips are comfortable and don‚Äôt slide. I have not had any issues. For the price this is a great value and great quality. I highly recommend this for any home gym with resistance bands. I would have given 5 stars if it didn‚Äôt have to be screwed together. A solid bar would have been better. It hasn‚Äôt caused me any problems I just tighten it every once in a while.,1,0

The antennae on the side of the helmet had snapped off and will need to be glued back on. There's a really garish emblem on the back of the helmet that's part of the helmet mold so it can't be painted over. I'd say the only saving grace about this helmet is that it's big enough to fit my fat head. Overall you'd be better off buying a helmet off of Etsy.",0,0
"This case is very pretty, yet professional looking. The rotation is important for me and works well, and I also like having a stylus holder and pocket for business cards etc. As others have mentioned, it is difficult to remove, but I rarely need to once it‚Äôs set up. The only other improvement I would like is that there are only two positions, a third would be perfect. All in all a good choice for the price.",1,0

Very good product for the price. I gave 4 stars because it is a pain to tighten enough to keep it in place. The inside of the clamp should have some ridges so that it grips the spacers and will keep it in place better. Came from overseas and it was not mentioned online. I really did not like that. They had wrong address and it went to PA instead of MS. The shipper called me for directions and was kind enough to reroute it to me with no extra charge. It was slow to ship and it was very slow to arrive coming from overseas.,1,0

"These nesting dolls are very pretty. Very nice work and that is why I'm giving them 2 stars. However, the second doll seems to have been shellacked shut. It is impossible to open. Even my husband tried prying them. It is impossible. I think it is ridiculous that the purpose of this toy is to be able to be opened (by a child) and they cannot even be opened by a grown man. I bought them even though I saw that in someone else's review, and I wish I didn't because they cannot be returned. So, now I'm stuck with a set of nesting dolls and I can only open the first one.

I was very excited to use these but found very quickly that they were crap! The salt got stuck under the cover and every time you turn the cover to adjust what size holes you are using the salt poured out and even when all the holes were closed it did the same.

I contacted customer support to inquire about a new piece, but they would only refer me to a service center which is over 90 minutes from my house.

"I saw the John Wayne version of this film in a theatre in 1970. In my opinion this was his best performance of his career. Later, I read the book. I love both versions of the film, but if I had to choose, I would choose the Coen brothers. They really followed the book. As Matty states, ""You must pay for everything in this life. Nothing is free except the grace of God."" She pays a heavy price for justice. The Coen brothers portrayed the ""spirit"" of the story completely.
