The bristles are gentle on the skin, yet provide a thorough, deep pore cleansing.  The rotating head vibrates enough to be effecting, but not so fast that it feels like a grinding wheel and the entire package is easy to hold in your palm.  Great for control and being easy to reach all the areas of your face. The motor is powerful and does not get bogged down and the charge lasts a really long time. It has two speeds - one for extra gentle - but she rarely uses this speed.  Plus the entire package is waterproof.  To charge, just rest it in the cradle charger provided.\n\nMy wife like to use her preferred cleanser (not a bar of soap). Her recommendation is to keep the brush head clean and dry when not in use.  In other words, don't use it, put it down and just walk away.  Keep the head clean and make sure it dries really well between use.  She sets hers bristle down on a folded sheet of paper towel.

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

And it burned my eyes a little. Must wash off after 10 mins, it leaves a sticky film. Not a terrible, but not my favorite.\n\nI tried four products, including this one, each for two weeks, 1x per day after face wash at bedtime.

It smells great, like all their products, and moisturizes like a dream!  The skin under my eyes has never ever felt SO SMOOTH and wrinkle free. I started using it on a couple other spots on my face because it minimizes wrinkles so well. Dark circles appeared lessened because of improved hydration, tone, etc.  This one was my clear winner.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Womens-Eye-Contour-Serum/dp/B0087CRJDO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Womens Eye Contour Serum</a>\nBright white and thicker cream has virtually zero scent. It is very gentle and felt like nothing at all, so I wore this one under makeup during the day. It soaks in super fast and doesn't feel greasy, but lasts for hours. Definitely helped reduce puffiness. Maybe a bit on the dark circles, too.  Second choice. I'd buy this one again! Contains: eyeliss and haloxyl.

The scent is a little too strong, but still pleasant and floral. Left my skin feeling very smooth, and very moisturized at first, but didn't last long enough. One pump gel goes a very long way, so I ended up smearing most of it on my face. Not intense enough for my dry, baggy under-eye skin.

By now you know that I am not only a licensed Hair stylist and Makeup Artist to some of the biggest names, but I am one of the most trusted on product knowledge. You also know that I am not paid for endorsements and I'm unbiased. Moroccan Oil was exciting when it first launched at our industry trade show, Premiere, in Orlando, Fl. They had demo's on the spot, and handed out mini sample bottles to everyone with their grubby little hands out, mine included. As I researched this product and its ingredients a little deeper, I discovered that it is only a subtle, temporary fix for giving a little smoothing effect to the hair. There is no long term benefits from using this product. Don't waste your money. Yes, it smells nice, but it's not what it claims to be. No, I'm not hating on Moroccan Oil. There is nothing wrong with using it if you are just looking for a subtle and temporary fix and don't mind spending the money. You could get better results with pure organic coconut oil (used in small amounts). Now that I've told you the truth about this product, I will be honest and say I love their hairsprays and glimmer shine spray. You'll have to read those reviews there. If you want an alternative to this oil, Orofluido is much better, smells better and has more lasting results. Be sure to read my reviews before purchasing any hair product.

I never bought any because of the price, and, I am not all that self conscious about my balding anyway.  However when a good friend of mine got some for his thinning hair I was so impressed by how it good it looked that I begged him to let me use it just once.  The color wasn't exactly right but that didn't matter since it was only a test... Unfortunately I have to say that even though it worked very well on my friends hair that is only thinning, it was a total bomb for me who has a real beach head coming in on the top.  Quite simply, one has to pay very close attention to the description of how this stuff says it works.  It clearly states that it needs or works by bonding with your existing hair.  If you have either no, or hardly any existing hair, it just comes out looking like a lot of very homely fuzzy stuff.  I tried it all over the top of my head and it simply stuck to it, and then ended up looking like some kind of very short, fuzzy, sparsely covered type dog hair.  Very ugly and fake looking and not at all worth the price or the bother for sure....\n\nAs for how it worked for my friend I have nothing but praise.  It was amazing the way it blended in and stuck to what thinning hair he had and combed out looking completely natural.  If you really want to see how this stuff looks in use, type the name of it into google and go to videos.  There are several online that depict a true demonstration of how good this stuff works on thinning hair.  Even on very thinning hair.  But not a one I found showed someone with a real Dr. Phil look, or even just a completely bare bald spot.  Without some minimal hair to cling to you are like me, fresh out of luck and too late.  If my hair was only thinning I would consider the hefty price of this worth it I believe.  Just remember for the truly bald, its a bust...\n\nIn conclusion, I decided to take off one star on the rating simply because I feel that despite this working very well on thinning hair, I believe that the description should more forcefully state that its not for bald heads. I don't think it does clearly enough to satisfy me. Not even the manufacturers web site that has a more detailed description says anything about bald heads.  Personally I feel that the majority of the negative reviews of it comes from those that are too far ahead with hair loss and just came out with a big fail on their part.  It was with me for sure.  Highly recommended only  for those with thinning hair that this stuff can cling too, and that feel hiding it well is worth the price... : )"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-56091", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I have noticed no difference in my skin, and I have been using it everyday!"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-73502", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I have dry skin which was caused by a reaction from a popular anti aging company.

It did not perfect anything.  My skin looked exactly the same but with mild sparkles all over.  The pink all blended sheer.  (FYI, in case it helps the reader,  I am a light medium complexion, not fair, but not olive or yellow, I tan easily and when not tanned I normally wear a pinky color type blush).\n\nSince this  blended sheer and looked like I had put nothing on my skin other than a bit of sparkle, I decided to layer it on a few times on my cheeks to see if it would work as a natural looking blush.  It did blush my cheeks, but then it also turned up the sparkle too much for my liking.\n\nLooking at the ingredients, it starts with a few silicones at the top of the list.  So I would consider this to be a simple silicone primer.  Any color or skin perfecting you desire you will still have to accomplish via other methods, ex:  foundation of choice or mineral makeup of choice.\n\nI think I will have to save this for special events, or date nights.  This product could maybe add a nice touch for night-time makeup.  ( the sparkly touch might look nice in low lighting (restaurants, etc) or in pictures (as in: the pigments and sparkles will reflect the camera light and \"hide\" imperfections as far as the picture goes, but not in person).

I warm it up in my fingers and dab a little on my eyelid and smooth it over for a nice clean base. It makes eyeshadow stand out even more; they look more pigmented, rich, and they are easy to blend and last all day. It goes on creamy but it feels matte after you apply it, which is a nice change from other primers that feel too wet at times. A little definitely goes a long way with this primer, and it covers up any coloring or veins I have on my eyelids. I find that it also helps with under eye circles, so some mornings I just dab a little of that under my eyes instead of concealer. Just don't use too much! I've not had any bad reactions with wearing it, and I tend to have sensitive eyes with wearing contacts (and also with the spring allergies).\n\nHowever...\nThe Bad: I will say that while being matte is awesome, sometimes my eyelids feel incredibly dry if I use it too frequently. It dries incredibly fast so you have to apply it quickly. I just take my middle finger and do a circular motion in the pot to help warm it on my fingertip and do one eye at a time. I also think it'd be helpful if it came in two more shades. I have light skin and use the Taffy, but I can still see the color of the primer on my lid. This isn't a huge issue since eyeshadow layers on top, but I have to careful not to blend it out too far. I think if they had one shade lighter and darker it'd make it a much more versatile range of primers.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased with this primer. I'm a fan of Stila makeup and it works very wells for me.\n\nEdit-\nI've been using this primer for much longer now and have to change my opinion on some things and my rating from 4 stars to 2. I had said before that my eyelids felt really dry afterwards. Well, this product is definitely not for continuous use. I can only use it maybe once a week! Otherwise my eyelids literally feel rough, itchy, and kind of crackly. It won't bother me after wearing it all day, but if I use it 2-3 days in a row, forget it. The price is too high for something I can only use 1-2 times a week. Plus who wants their eyelids to hurt?! I still think that the payoff is pretty great and that my shadows look great and don't crease.

Mine looks almost exactly like the picture but the shaded areas around the circle are more grey than brown which could be just the camera that was used to take the image.\n\nWhen opening the product for the first time it smelled amazing.  It is a thick cream consistency and slightly greasy to the touch.  Since I had already washed and dried my hair I tried it by using it more as a leaving in conditioner rather than washing it out.  The product worked immediately and made my blonde, dried out, frizzy, hair smooth and supple.  That alone gives it a five star review.\n\nI'm not sure why but it was still bothering me that the product could be fake so I took the ingredients label and compared it to the ingredients on the real Wen website and they were a perfect match.  Not that the label couldn't be fake too but I feel if the product was fake, they did a terrific job making a knock off and in the end all that really matters is that I have a product that smells wonderful and corrects the horrible damage that's been done to my hair.  My guess is that other websites are selling it at the \"suggested retail\" price of $58 because there are buyers out there willing to pay.  My guess is that this seller is selling legitimate Wen products that were the rejects from the manufacturer due to the label being slightly discolored. (think Ross or TJ Maxx).

In fact, I've found that I prefer the common hyaluronc acid serums you can find everywhere these days. They are:\n\n1) Much cheaper and easier to find\n2) Cosmetically elegant / apply well with other products\n3) Can be DIY'ed\n\nI notice a lot of people who have started using this at the recommendation of their dermatologist or surgeon. Hyaluronic acid (sodium hyaluronate) is amazing because it is a hydrophilic (water-loving) molecule that binds H2O and is naturally present in skin and other soft tissues. It lubricates joints, eyes, and can hold 1000 times it's own weight in H2O. Skin that is abundant in hyaluronic acid is better able to hold moisture and look plump - and diminish wrinkles. If you have never used hyaluronic acid aside from this product, and you'd prefer not to spend $100 for 2oz, TRY a generic hyaluronic acid serum first. I personally love My Beauty Diary Hyaluronic sheet masks, but I'd recommend the Timeless Skincare 4oz bottle of hyaluronic acid for anyone that prefers not to look like Hannibal Lecter when they get in bed, or for layering in the morning.\n\nIf you're looking for a great moisturizer with amazing hydration, look at SkinMedica's Dermal Repair Cream.

I use a pea sized amount as you don't need to use a lot to clean the hair, but somehow it always feels like I dumped a ton of conditioner on the crown of my head without rinsing when I get out of the shower. I absolutely love the conditioner that goes with this shampoo, it is truly great on it's own, but I can only condition the very ends of my hair or else I wind up looking like I haven't conditioned in days. I'm not sure why my stylist thinks this is the right shampoo for me, but I highly caution people with fine or medium to light weight hair to go a different route. If you have thick hair and want a luxurious shampoo that won't strip your color, give this a try, but use a very small amount until you find the right amount for your hair."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-51899", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Really like product, but packaging is horrible.

Why? Because after a week and less than 1/4 of the can used, the entire spray nozzle has failed. It's not clogged or blocked. It has simply stopped working. This happened as I was in the middle of preparing for a formal wedding at 5pm on a Saturday night at a country resort in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't run out and buy a new can of hair spray and I had to borrow some from the bride!!! Never again.\n\n***************** Original Review below **************************************************\nI use hair spray every single day and I have been trying to find a single good brand that does the job off my current two brands. I have settled on Suave for the days when I am outside with the horses in the wind, dust and humidity simply because it is inexpensive and my hair stays put. But the trade off is I can't run a brush through my hair after spraying it and it can get dry in the summer. My second option has been Fekkai brand which is excellent, smells pretty, and holds well, yet feels soft & I can brush my hair and it still looks great. But....Fekkai is outrageously overpriced and hard to justify & the nozzles don't always work.\n\nThis CHI Keratin has a mild and not unpleasant scent, sprays out in a wide, fine mist and doesn't feel sticky. My hair feels soft and looks nice - the same way it does with the Fekkai and I can brush it for touch ups. If I use a bit more than when I use the Suave, I get a similar strong hold in a wind outside and humidity. On a normal day or if I am going to be inside only, a light spritz of the CHI is all I need. So I think I may have finally found my combination hair spray that does what both the others did all in one."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-79876", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I love this shampoo and conditioner, but honestly...

The telogen effluvium (hair loss due to stress including fasting)that I probably had may have resolved even without the shampoo.

Also, having to use the brush to go over hair several times means it frizzed my roots a bit. Worst part of ColorWow is it transfers to your hands esp fingernails if you touch your hair. I didn't realize how much I touch my hair until this product. After a while, it made me look forward to washing it out. To help others on their quest, I'll note that I've tried two other products. ColorMark, which is like a marker, is ok but after applying enough to cover silver in some spots it got a bit cakey. So so coverage otherwise and time consuming. For me the first thing I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond, EverPro Gray Away, which is what I call a colored hairspray is the easiest and provides best coverage. Not sure of color match if my hair wasn't dark brown/black. But works best for me without grit or cake build up, quick application, and fairly full coverage.

I misplaced the curler I was using (again) and the Japonesque Curler was all I had available. Being determined to curl these lashes, I pulled it out and gave it a shot. TO MY SURPRISE, my eyelashes curled like I've NEVER seen them curl before! Yes, this item is \"plastic-ie\", but if used correctly, it works wonders!! I will never buy another curler again! I'm hooked! Seriously, my lashes curl so well that I only put eye-liner on my top lid and I'm good to go. No more mascara!!!\n\nMy original review:\n\n\"I'm a little disappointed in this little curler. I lost my favorite eyelash curler a couple weeks ago and have had my eyes on this one for some time now (no pun intended). I finally made the purchase. While I -impatiently- waited for this to come in the mail (didn't take long, but I needed something), I bought a cheapy $2 eyelash curler from a local store...to my surprise, the $3 curler works much better than this Japonesque Curler. I used a different curler on each eye to compare the two and unfortunately, this curler didn't curl my lashes nearly as well.

There are not very many hair dryers like that on the market except ones specifically geared towards my demographic (if you know what I mean). So, this hair dryer fit the bill. When I received the package I initially tested it out and the first thing I noticed was the awesome comb attachment. It is made of durable plastic and the pik's teeth are thick and seem to be well constructed. I don't think you'll have a problem with comb breaking at all. Now as for the hair dryer itself, it is a fail. The hair dryer is a very pretty red color and is relatively quiet but its very awkward to hold in your hands for a long period of time. It felt like my hands were sliding off of the handle, not to mention the control buttons are right on the area where you would hold the dryer - definitely annoying. The hair dryer also doesn't seem to get very hot. I need major heat and this was just so-so. I had an Andis dryer before and while my Andis is only 1875 watts it seemed to get my hair much more straighter.

It went on much smoother than the masks I am accustomed to using.  It felt creamier and got into difficult areas around nose and creases in neck.  Drying time really depends on oil content of your skin.  It actually took about 12 minutes to totally dry on my face, especially around my nose where I have high oil concentration.  It came off quite smoothly in the shower and did not get stuck in hairy areas of my mustache, eyebrows, and hair line.  It did provide me with an invigorating tingling feeling that I enjoy and seemed to remove blackheads well.\n\n\"The only thing prohibitive of regular usage would be the cost.

I used my favorite toner and decided not to use any night cream because my face still felt greasy.

I should admit that I have a thick, coarse, fast-growing beard, and what I review here may not be applicable for men with beards that are not as thick, coarse, or fast-growing. Upon reading the reviews of the open-comb, #25C being a more aggressive razor due to the open comb, I decided to give it a try.\n\nI've tried every type of shaving in the 40+ years that I've been shaving, including wet shaving with disposable razors, multiple-blade cartridge razors, double-edged safety razors, shavettes, and straight razors; and I've tried a number of different electric razors. No method of shaving comes close to shaving with a straight razor, which I did for years, but I tired of the constant maintenance (stropping 50 to 60 times each morning, occasional honing, and annual sharpening by a professional service), and the cost. Insofar as the multiple-blade cartridge razors, the cost is prohibitive, and the supposed benefits of multiple blades is a gimmick, at least as far as my experience with them. Disposable razors are hit-and-miss in terms of quality. Even using a good quality double-edged razor, I still need to do a final touch-up with a shavette, unless I want 5 o'clock shadow by noon.\n\nSo, I thought that the 25C would provide a closer shave than the 33C, as posted by many reviewers.\n\nIt doesn't.\n\nI could detect no discernable difference between the 25C and the 33C. Upon close inspection of the design, I am convinced that it is because the base plate on the 25C holds the blade much closer to the comb that does the base plate on the 33C. On the closed-comb 33C, there is about 1mm of space between the blade and the comb, which allows for more direct contact with the skin by the blade, depending upon the angle at which one holds the razor. On the open-comb 25C, the blade is almost in direct contact with the combs, with no perceptible space between them. Consequently, it is not possible to get the same full contact with the skin as it is with the 33C.\n\nI did change the blades that I've been using, switching to the Feather Hi-stainless blades, which appear to be much sharper than the Astra blades or the Personna blades that I had been using. Still, even with the Feather blades, the shave is not close enough, and I have to do a final pass against the grain with a straight-razor or a shavette. The feather blades last for about 3 shaves before I have to replace them.\n\nBoth the 25C and the 33C are fine DE razors, and I would buy them again. However, I will be more cautious in reading reviews of razors claiming to be \"more aggressive.\""}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-20303", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Adds volume to your hair, but leaves the scalp greasy and flaky."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-42045", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I have been using this brand a lot of years,this brand is very famous in dermo cosmetic products.\n\nSince I had my child I started to have little wrinkles after bad nights.

Very easy to work up in your palm or with face lathering. The lather itself is thick, rich, and luxurious. In the tub the texture is more on the moist side than a cella. Exceptionally creamy. But my problem is the scent.\n\nSandalwood scents are one of my favorites. I like sandalwoods that are fused with citrus, or maybe other frangrant oils or essential oils to create a complex sensual experience. But this scent is a one shot pony: it smells like natural sandalwood. Nothing complex or tantalizing. Nothing to linger and tease the senses about what it is. The smell completely falls flat: it's wood! I have a sandalwood chess set, and that's what this smell like. My mother-in-law has a block of sandalwood that she uses for her prayers, and that is EXACTLY what this smell is like. To say the smell is \"boring\" would give it too much credence. It also has a weird after scent.\n\nI can't place my finger on it, but it is like an overly waxy kind of smell. Not a fragrance. Just waxy Sandalwood. If I smelled this long it would give me a headache. But I did give it three stars because the lather was pretty sick!\n\nIf you want something to compare with AOS Sandalwood, try Trumpers Sandalwood soap. This is a triplemilled hard, so you would be comparing a cream to a soap. However, the soap has a distinct citrus smell harmonized with soft scents of Sandalwwd. One of my absolute favorite Sandalwood scents, and and another awesome lather producer. You could also try the Trumpers Sandalwood cream, which has a softer version of the sandalwood scent than the Trumper's bar, but still MUCH MUCH better than the AOS Sandalwood. ((BTW, if you are looking for a top AOS cream, I highly recomend the Ocean Kelp--See my review)  Evelyn & Crabtee also has a sandalwood, but its more of a floral scent. Pleasant, but not terribly manly. Then there is the Italian Cella\n\nSo I don't really see this Sandalwood by AOS sustaining a big part market share of \"Sandalwood soaps\" without some type of reformulation. Oh sure, they have the big name, but the really need to work on those scents. The smell is quite pedestrian, like something you would find from a vendor in the hallways at the mall, or maybe selling some cheap incense.  If you like Sandalwood, go with Trumpers Bars; notes of citrus, great moisturing, tightens skin, and smells awesome!!!!

I purchased my Mia 2 from Herbergers when I had stopped in to purchase more Clinique face wash.  I had been using Clinique face wash for over a year and for some reason it just wasn't working anymore.  The girl at the counter told me about Mia 2 and being a 40 yr old with a break-out that wouldn't go away, I decided to spend the money and give it a shot.  The girl had a couple coupons that brought the price down and made me feel slightly better about spending the money on it.\n\nI've had problems with breakouts for the past 10-12 yrs and have tried countless different face washes without success until the Clinique. Then that stopped working. This latest breakout was along my jawline.  I have a problem with oily skin all month long but its especially bad during my cycle. I've been using the Mia 2 for a little over 2 weeks now and initially I had little extra breakout spots, which I expected as the extra junk rose to the surface. Nothing big.  The breakouts along my jawline, I THINK, are finally starting to heal. Is it clearing up because of the Mia 2 or the cleanser?  Don't know that.  I can tell that the pores on my nose and chin are smaller and I'm sure that's because of the Mia 2.  Happy about that.  We'll see what happens with my next cycle.\n\nI also used this on my 9 yr old who has a problem with white heads on her nose and blackheads on her chin.  After only a few uses, we could already see a difference in her skin.  So for that, we both feel it's worth it.\n\nWhat I don't like about the Mia 2:\nI don't like the timed shut off.  I don't like that I only get one minute to wash my face and I don't see the point in the little beep that tells me to switch to a different spot on my face.  I get that it's so I can get the most out of that one minute but if it didn't have that one minute time in the first place they wouldn't need the stupid  beep.  Most days, I feel I need more than a minute so I'm hitting the button to use up two one minute cycles.  What if I'm having a particularly bad day and feel I need to wash extra or have an extra large face?  Or, in my case, I need to wash my jaw line and part of my neck so that's not included in the spots they tell you to wash for a certain amount of time and therefore I run out of time when washing my face and the thing shuts off on me.  Frustrating.\n\nThe second speed is pointless.  I honestly cannot tell any difference between the first and the second speed but I still hit the button twice. I guess it's psychological. It must be going faster if I'm hitting the button twice, right?!\n\nThe battery life totally SUCKS!  The instructions say that you should charge it for 24 hrs before the initial use.  Like most battery opperated items you buy, that's normal.  So then I read that I can expect 24 minutes of use out of a full charge.  Serious?!  That's it?!  So if I'm using two one minute charges morning and night (not including if I use it on my daughter), that's only going to give me 6 days of use!  What a crock!  To top that off is the charging time.  It's almost as bad as the initial charge.  I went to use it one night and it was dead.  So, I popped it on the charger before I went to bed, not knowing how long it would take to charge, I figured it would be ready for me to use the next morning.  Nope, it was still charging when I got up! Came home from work and it was STILL charging!  Pulled out my instruction manual to see what it said about charge time and I read that it takes 18 HOURS for additional charges!  Again...SERIOUS?!  Isn't there a rapid charger or something?!  Depending on when I put it on the charger, that's like 2-3 face washings I have to miss for a charging.  I just have a hard time believing that for the amount of money this thing costs they wouldn't put better battery in this thing or give you a better charger!\n\nSo those are my thougts on it.  I'm fairly satisfied with the results and won't be returning it but had I known ahead of time the things I know now, I don't know if I would have spent the money on it.  I'm certainly not rich and struggled with the decision to buy it because of the cost.  I will update again in a month or so to let you know how things are going.\n\nUpdate 12/1/2013...so after using for a couple months but before my 90 days was up, I just wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see in my breakouts and decided this was too much money to spend on something that was going to sit in my drawer and not work so I contacted Clarisonic to start the return process.  To Clarisonics credit, they didn't question my return or give me any trouble. I had to email them a copy of my receipt and within two days they emailed me a UPS shipping label to return the product. So we'll see how long it takes me to get my refund check.

I didn't realize how much I touch my hair until this product. After a while, it made me look forward to washing it out. To help others on their quest, I'll note that I've tried two other products. ColorMark, which is like a marker, is ok but after applying enough to cover silver in some spots it got a bit cakey. So so coverage otherwise and time consuming. For me the first thing I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond, EverPro Gray Away, which is what I call a colored hairspray is the easiest and provides best coverage. Not sure of color match if my hair wasn't dark brown/black. But works best for me without grit or cake build up, quick application, and fairly full coverage.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell.

The Jack Black face scrub is painful.\n\nAnyway, even though I have not run out of my current supply of Beard Lube, I ordered this Shave Cream.  I used it for the first time about 30 minutes ago.  This stuff is REMARKABLE!  It takes a bit more effort to apply than Beard Lube (I do not own $200 shaving brushes) but I worked up a good lather with just my fingers.

Without exaggerating one iota, this was the closest, cleanest, most comfortable shave I have ever had.\n\nRest assured readers, if you are considering this product, BUY IT!

I bought this curling iron for my wife, after reading online reviews.  She LOVED this curling iron.  She liked that it heated up fast, opened and closed well, gripped her hair when she wanted it to, and let go when it was supposed to.\n\nI couldn't say exactly when it went from \"love\" to less than that.  But it started probably around the two year mark, after being used on average, about once per week.  It started to not heat up really well, and I think that there had been a flaw of some kind in the power cord, at the point where the cord attaches to the swivel connection on the iron.  There was no visible problem, anywhere on the cord.  It eventually got to the point where it didn't heat at all.  That was probably in this last year, so it was a good 2-3 years old, I would say.\n\nSo this last winter, about 2/2014, I took the thing apart, and couldn't find a thing wrong.  I put it back together and kind of told my wife that it was her imagination--I don't know, I think I was just too busy at the time to be bothered.  Then when I saw her a few weeks later using another old curling iron, and I asked her why she wasn't using the her favorite, and she said it just doesn't work anymore.  So I figured maybe she wasn't making it up :)\n\nI took it apart again, and put an ohm meter on the cord part, and it was not good.  I figured it unlikely that it was in the actual cord.  So I started to cut into the thick part of the cord where it had a reinforced curve in it, and was able to get down to where I found that there must have been a break there.  I cut that part of the cord out, soldered the cord onto the connectors that had been inside that molded reinforced curve, and put all of it back together with epoxy as something of a new homemade connection to reinforce it, and she was off and running again.\n\nThen in just the last few months, probably when the curling iron was about 3 1/2 years old, my wife started complaining that the curling iron was not gripping her hair well enough, and was slipping, and also that it was making a squeaking sound whenever she opened and closed the pincers--don't know if that's the right term.  I am also not sure I understand another comment that she made, though, that she has trouble getting her hair out of it when she finds it is slipping.\n\nAnyway, all of that doesn't matter.  I just looked at the spring area and could see that up underneath where the spring is, the point that contacts the pincer just below the thumb knob, there is a tiny roller that helps the spring to slide quietly back and forth, that was off center, and it also wasn't rolling anymore.  It was mostly sliding.  So I adjusted it to the side a little, and liberally sprayed some dry lubricant on it.  The action works better, and it doesn't make any noise, so we will have to wait until she uses it again to see if it works.\n\nSo as of today 6/16/2014, the iron is still going after approximately 200+ uses, albeit with some required tweaking to keep it out of the garbage.  I would like to believe that the power cord issue that we had was a rare defect, and that most people never run into that.  I'm thinking that most people could use this iron over 200 times and probably just be starting to have a squeaky spring issue, and that's about it.  If I were to have to start this product search again, I would definitely take a chance again on this iron, and hope that we didn't get the cord defect in that reinforced bend near the swivel.\n\nFor the money, and the use that we've had with this, I think it's a great deal.  I actually just realized that we probably have used it many more than 200 times, as we have four girls aged 12 and under as well, but they generally don't get their hair curled, although on some special occasions, several of them do.\n\nDetails on my star rating:\nWhy did I ding this by one star?  Well, although I would buy it again in a second, Amazon's star system equates four stars with a \"like it\" and five stars as a \"love it.\"  I could imagine some engineering tweaks to their design that would eliminate the issues we had.  Also, I saw the inside of it when I was working on it, and although the parts were adequate, I would be cheating a curling iron with better quality parts that deserved the five stars, if I were to give this one five.\n\nAs I've said in other reviews that I've written, to me, either four or five stars is a \"buy with confidence\" in my book.  I wouldn't buy anything again with 1-2 stars on my scale, and a middle-of-the-road three star review by me would be \"your mileage may vary\" and would be a 50/50 shot."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-49460", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Purchased 6/2010, reviewed 6/2014:\n\nWell, better late than never.

I have dropped BD's from much higher and on tile and it still held up.

I'm a big fan of Reuzel and I use several of their products everyday.  The Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm) are the first Reuzel products I have ever been disappointed with.\n\nThe directions on the label instruct to apply this product to a clean, towel dried beard (I normally use beard oil in this manner). The problem is that this product contains no natural oils, only a bunch of unnecessary chemicals. The only up side is that it also contains Reuzel's T-4 Tonic Blend which is beneficial. But your beard needs more than just that. It needs natural oils and conditioners, not all the chemicals.  I prefer the results I get with all natural products.  My beard is softer, healthier and more manageable when using my regular products.\n\nMy regular routine consists of a quality beard oil right out of the shower, massaging it into the skin and brushing it through the hair with a boar bristle brush. I let the oil absorb while I tend to other things.  A few minutes later I apply a beard balm that contains Shea Butter, Mango Seed Butter, Lanolin, Apricot Kernel Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, Beeswax, and Cocoa Seed Butter. Then at the end I apply a little beard wax to provide the hold. This gives me a soft, healthy, manageable beard without any chemicals and no long term hair damage. The results of my routine are far superior to the Reuzel Beard Foam & Beard Balm combo.\n\nOkay, the scent...  I know full well that smells are subjective, but... this Beard Foam STINKS!!  At first it smells like soap, --so far so good-- BUT then it goes through a bad breath stage, which progresses into to a plastic/rubbery smell, then it finally settles into a powdery scent, similar to the Beard Balm.  This powdery scent then lingers on, and on, and on, and on...  I personally HATE  powdery smells, so if you're like me avoid the Beard Foam (and the Beard Balm, it's even worse).  However, if you're one of those weirdos that actually wants to smell like a big 'ol powder puff, well... you're going to love it.\n\nSpeaking to the 'deodorizing' properties, I suppose if you just finished eating your girlfriend's second-hand tuna sandwich the Beard Foam may provide a slight improvement to your beard's smell. But come on man, just wash it already...\n\nREUZEL BEARD FOAM INGREDIENTS:  Water (Aqua), Disodium Cocoyl Glutamate, Polysorbate 20, Sodium PCA, PEG-12 Dimethicone, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cetrimonium Chloride, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) Leaf Extract, Urtica Dioica (Nettle) Leaf Extract, Equisetum Arvense (Horsetail Root) Extract, Rosmarinus Officinallis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Soyethyl Morpholinium Ethosulfate, Benzyl Alcohol, Dehydroacetic Acid, Citric Acid, Fragrance (Parfum), Benzyl Benzoate, Linalool, Coumarin, Limonene, Alpha-Isomethyl Ionone, Hydroxycitronellal"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-7625", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "cheaper than retail stores here in the city, the only 'bad' thing was that i had to wait for it to arrive ground because it was flammable it couldn't be sent next or second day."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-17191", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I've used the regular CHI Silk Infusion and prefer it to this by a lot.

The Mousse had no scent; this has a mild scent but I'm not sure what it is. It is very faint and doesn't smell anything like the typical self-tanning products (from drug store version to high end version, they all have a tell tale scent.)  After an hour or so, the scent seemed a bit stronger, but was still mild compared with the typical self tanner scent and certainly wasn't enough to make me self conscious.\n\nI tested on my forearms and hands, and after about 3-4 hours, my skin had a nice, fresh glow. The product itself is white, a mix between a rich, thick cream and a lotion that easily blends into the skin. It dries fairly quickly; the first application I used a bit too much on my right arm and it took longer to dry fully to the touch (around 30 min.) I was more careful with my left arm and used half the amount - about 1.5 dime size of product on the second arm. It blends easily, but no matter what product I use or how careful I am, I always have at least a few streaks. The streaks this time were on my fingers, which is always a hard area to cover to ensure you get the backs but not fronts of the fingers.\n\nThe second application helped to easily cover up my streaks.

It's juicy, and strong.\n\n  After a few minutes, Artisan evens out with a pleasing floral note (orange blossoms, as I'm told), and you catch hints of aromatic wood and sweet musk.  Sadly, this fades away within an hour or two, and the cologne no longer projects.  If you move in close, you'll detect a feint whiff of what it once was (it smells as if someone lightly dabbed orange peel and vanilla on your skin).\n\n  At $78 retail for the 4.2 oz bottle (I purchased Artisan from a department store), this kills Artisan as a likable product for me.  As other users have alluded, you're paying to get teased.  To find the silver lining, I'd recommend Artisan for short term use, in occasions such as walks on the beach, coffee dates, a trip to the store, etc.  To note, I've also had better longevity with Artisan in warmer climates.\n\n  All in all, if the makers manage to extend the longevity and projection of Artisan, I'd be a lifetime customer.

I am a native Floridian and had alot of sun damage in the form of uneven skin tones and dark patches.

If I had unlimited income I would still be using the cleansing line, and may again.  Love the smell and feel of my skin - even before lotion.  However, Cetaphil still gives me non-drying non-irritating cleansing that it has for 30 years and it's alot more economical, beside I always use some type of lotion after cleansing.  The strengthener is 5% pro-niacin and lighter than the intensive or eye cream. I tried putting my daily facial sunscreen over the strengthener but too much lotion.  That is why I added the sunscreen when daily sunscreen became necessary in March.  The sunscreen is only 2.5% pro-niacin but priced accordingly.  It was better than eliminating the pro-niacin or sunscreen.  I also tried the decolletage lotion at 2.5% pro-niacin for spots on chest and hands but did not see results.

Not only is workmanship sloppy, it is not the standard of profession warranted by Babyliss Pro. (picture uploaded to Amazon)\n\nI shared one with my roommate back in university for a couple of years. The texture of a legit Babyliss straightener glides on hair smoothly, leaves hair soft and smooth, heats up instantly, and you see results within minutes. My roommate has it for 5 years now and it is working in top-notch condition as the day she received it.\n\nThe one I received DID not do any of the above. It straightens but it is comparable to a cheap straightener from a drug store. My hair is left somewhat straight and rough. The straightener is VERY light and feels all plastic! (Granted, Babyliss straighteners are light but it doesn't feel cheap) The power cord is also loose (i.e, in the future it is very likely to not transmit not enough power to the straightener)\n\nAnyway, I am not gonna leave the seller's name bc Idk if they know of it or not...so please, inspect yours upon arrival.

It's one of the things I admire and pride myself about my body. One day during finals week (I'm guessing excessive stress made this happen) but I got a pimple. It hurt so bad and was huge. When I do (rarely) get a pimple, you can barely see them because I treat them before and during its early emergence on my face. Somehow, I came across (Please don't publicly shame me when I say this) an Instagram post on Yahoo of a Kylie Jenner snapchat of how she treats her face for acne. Due to that snapchat and my desperation, I forked over $16 on this drying lotion. Why did I do that? This stuff just chemically burns the crap out of my face, left the area peeling, and left behind a dark case of hyper-pigmentation. My skin isn't even that sensitive. Never again will I buy something like this to put on my face. I'll stick to the basics that have always worked for me.\n\nHere's what works for me if you're curious: I get almost all of this stuff on amazon\n-A gentle cleanser (cetaphil or neutrogena)\n-Oil cleansing every now and then (olive oil and castor oil with a few drops of Trader Joe's tea tree oil are my faves)\n-ACV mixed with water as a toner or Burt's Bees tomato toner\n-Tea tree oil and clean and clear's persa-gel ( to treat bumps and pimples )\n**I've learned that if you really want to have nice skin, you have to protect it and keep it moisturized. Also keep your routine SIMPLE**\n-Olay Total effects 7 in one SPF 30 or Olay Complete for Combination/Oily skin SPF 15 in the am (depends on the season)\n-Olay Regenerist Night Cream in the pm or SR Luna Oil with SR Good Genes serum\n\n(The only non-drug store things I use on my face are Sunday Riley's Luna Oil and Good Genes serum. They're pretty darn good!!! The Luna Oil also has certain antiseptic properties that help prevent acne! Crazy right?! It also makes my skin so soft! The serum is good for hyper-pigmentation and brightening skin. Both of them do many other things too! Sephora has a duo kit for $78. It was a birthday gift to myself! I work on campus! Don't judge! As a college student, I often times don't get as much sleep that I'm suppose to and I was afraid that it would start showing in my face even though the saying is \"Black don't crack\". I got this duo to help prevent premature aging. #wrinkles #bags #Crowsfeet #SayNoToFillers #SayNoToBotox #AgeGraciously)\n\n***Side Note: I use to have really bad oily skin. In early high school, I would dry it out with acne astringents and skip out on moisturizer at night because I didn't want my face to be really oily. Eventually, I realized that my face was overproducing oils because of this behavior. The moment I started using gentle cleansers, oils, and moisturizers, the moment my skin realized it didn't need to drown itself in sebum. As I go through my day, I still do produce oil on my skin but it's not excessive. It's just a healthy amount to protect my face from the harsh environment and create a healthy glow. During the warmer months, I walk around with a pack of oil blotting sheets just in case.\n\nI hope this helped someone! I know it was a lot to read. Also, use smile.amazon.com to make your purchases!

The only thing I noticed within the first two weeks of use was that my hair seemed to be more soft, but nothing else. Then after a few months I saw a small difference. The hair that was thinning started to thicken and where it was receding I saw a limited amount of growth. More time passed and I was not sure if any results came about. It was a slow progression. Recently, I was looking for a specific picture on my PC unrelated to myself and I opened a photo of me that was 2-3 years old. WOW I was amazed how much of my hair had receded back then and now it looks significantly better. I can't over emphasis how much better my hair looks now. I remember BACK THEN I COULD NOT GROW OUT MY HAIR OUT LONG IN THE FRONT. The best way I can describe it is that where my hair was thinning it was like the hair pores were choking off the hair follicle or they were closing slowly causing my hair there to become frail and thin and barely grow. The rest of my hair is and has always been thick and coarse so this was surprising to see the difference in texture and the lack of growth. Now I have my hair long especially the front. I wear my hair in a Pompadour style. I can't imagine this works for everyone, but what does. I want to reiterate if your looking for fast or instant results this will most likely not work. I believe this is why so many others have stated this does not work.\n\nIt took me EIGHT months for me to notice a significant change, BUT now no one notices I have any issues with my hair and I do not look like I inherited my fathers hair line. I AM SO GLAD I LIVED IN THE TIME WHEN THIS WAS INVENTED!!!! Sure it's expensive, but what is your hairline worth? That's all I had to ask myself. It's in my nature to overbuy.

Since this doesn't happen when I use other purple shampoos or regular shampoos (since I have only half my hair dyed, I use a regular shampoo for the unbleached portion to avoid wasting the more expensive products), I believe that this shampoo isn't the most best in regards to cleaning your hair.\n\nTONING: 5/5\nThis shampoo is by far the best at removing yellow tones from my hair out of the 3 products I've tried. My hair was bleached pretty unevenly (I went to a bad salon for the first round of bleach, and they left my roots completely untouched; for this reason, when I did the other rounds of bleach, my roots remained one shade darker), so I noticed that it ONLY affected the lightest portion of my hair, which went from light blonde to platinum/silver blonde. The roots, which are more golden, were not affected at all, or at least insignificantly enough that I didn't notice any difference.\nAttached are photos of my hair directly before and after washing with Sexy Hair Bright Blonde Shampoo (after photos show both wet and dry) and photos of the shampoo itself, compared to TIGI's Dumb Blonde Shampoo. All photos (besides the one with wet hair) are taken under identical indoor lighting, with the same background for similar white balance.\n\nSHAMPOO COLOR:\nIt is said that the darker a purple shampoo is, the more effective it should be. This shampoo is a very dark blue-purple, very similar in shade to TIGI's Dumb Blonde shampoo - maybe a tad darker - but without shimmer.\n\nSCENT: 5/5\nThe scent is very pleasant. It is a very nice honey/chamomile scent, but it is not too strong, and it fades so you don't notice it throughout the day.\nIn comparison, TIGI's Dumb Blonde shampoo is completely inoffensive/unnoticeable; Davines Alchemic Silver Conditioner has a scent that is not chemical, but the smell (also not my favorite) is VERY strong and lasts days after washing your hair with it (which I find annoying).\n\nPACKAGING: 2/5\nThe packaging is not my favorite. I much prefer the pump of the TIGI Dumb Blonde shampoo, since I can quickly use one hand to pump out more shampoo as needed, rather than having to use both hands to pick up the bottle, click it open, and turn it over to squeeze the shampoo out."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-25857", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "I have been shaving my head and my beard with safety razors for many years now.

I have been working out a lot this year and counting calories, and I have lost more than 30 pounds.  I've been trying different anti-cellulite products to get a little extra help, appearance-wise.  I've been using this one for a few weeks now.\n\nIt is hard to tell if this is working.  I know that 95% of reducing cellulite is diet and exercise, so I have seen some improvement simply because of those factors.  I don't necessarily think any of it is due to this product in particular.  (I am just using this on the outer thighs and rear end, twice per day.  It is probably going to last about six weeks at the rate I am going, which is a reasonable period of time for a product of this size)  I am not noticing much change at all.  (In fairness, with other products, I do occasionally feel like I see a difference.)\n\nThe other thing is, I really don't like the oil format.  It doesn't absorb well into the skin at all and leaves a sheen of oil over where I've applied it, as well as on my hands.  There are some other body oils I use on occasion that don't have this problem.  But I really don't like the greasy feeling I get after I apply this.  (I ordered straight from Nuxe so I know I have a legitimate bottle of product.  The pump works well and it is plastic, which is nice -- I don't care for body care products in glass bottles, which can break very easily in *my* bathroom.)  Also, you do have to massage this in for a long time -- that's in the instructions on the package.  So this may not be for impatient people!\n\nIt is not causing any irritation or sensitivity-type reactions, so that's good.  I don't notice a strong smell or really any scent at all.  (I have constantly clogged sinuses, though, so maybe I am not the best judge...)\n\nPlease note this has some tree nut and sesame-derived ingredients, so avoid if you have those allergies.  You can see the full ingredients list if you zoom in on the product images.\n\nIn the end, you will get the most results from diet and exercise.  For supplementary purposes, I find massage with a cellulite massager and coffee scrub in the shower on the affected areas, plus using a body cream containing retinol twice a day to be most effective.

That is the best part about the product, but I can find another product that has good coverage and not as many negatives as this one did for me. I also liked the refreshing and light smell of the product.\n\nCons: I couldn't stand how thick and heavy this felt on my face. It was goopy and sticky for probably 25 minutes after I put it on. And then after that initial sticky feeling left my face, it still felt really heavy. I can't stand sticky and heavy feeling foundations and this was only a CC cream so it didn't even have as much coverage as a foundation. No thank you. I have been using the Lumene Age freeze CC cream and I have been loving that, so I would recommend giving that a try.

To terribly misquote Jim Morrison, \"No hair gets out of here alive\".... So, you're hoping against all odds that some miracle product will be a cheap, effective, undetectable cure-all in your fight against genetics or disease...well, the good news is THIS PRODUCT KIND OF WORKS. Let me be as transparent as the fine little hairs you're hoping will grow on your head - if you have some hair, but it's thinning pretty bad, this stuff will make it look fuller and hide some of the dreaded scalp showing through - however, if you plan on people getting really close to it, you can see the toppik on your scalp (at least, the dark colors show up if you're Caucasian or light skinned) - but this should work well for a job interview, a date in a restaurant, an acting/theatre gig, maybe even a family gathering - but if you plan on getting lucky and he/she not noticing the smudges on the pillow in the morning, you are out of luck....If battling hair loss is what you're up against, then Toppik is, metaphorically, another tool in the tool box.  Use it with along with everything else - but use it in moderation. Too much and you're a powdered, bald donut.\n\nFinally, don't blindly listen to the claims by some of these Amazon reviewers saying it's \"amazing\" and \"no one noticed\" - because, if anyone looked close enough, they probably could tell you've got cornstarch type colored powder layering your nearly hairless scalp. On the other hand, don't listen to all these complainers saying it doesn't work at all or that it's garbage - they're just angry, balding trolls with sweaty scalps who were just hoping to find a dirt cheap solution to a problem that has plagued men and women forever.  If you have little or no hair, this product really won't work - but if you're in the middle of your hair-less fight, you'll have some pretty good luck with this.  I hope this review helps - as I'm someone who's done Bosley, Propecia, Rogaine, Toppik, Tocotrienols and have had some luck with all of them.  If, after my long winded review you're still unsure (and you should be) then buy the tiny cheap bottle of Toppik (it will set you back around $10 with shipping) - it's a small price to pay to see if a product works for you.

I really don't like having greasy hair.\n\nIm really glad I got to try this stuff. While it goes on like a regular styling cream, once it dries it actually makes your hair softer than before, and yet somehow stays in place. Basically, if you have thick unmanageable hair, this stuff will somehow change your hair on a molecular level to the normal hair of a person that dated in high school.\n\nIt smells fine, but not something you normally associate with hair. Sort of like standing between a hair salon and an Italian restaurant, in terms of scent. I assume that's due to the Rosemary.\n\nSo, given that this stuff is so great, why four stars instead of five? Because its overpriced. Jack Black recently lowered the amount of product, but kept the price the same. The tube you get is far less than half full. Unless they were losing money before, they are price gouging now.  You used to get about 18% more in a bottle than you do now.

It's lightweight and narrow, unlike some of the bulky straighteners I've owned in the past. This is a plus as it takes up less counter space and isn't an eyesore.\n\nThere is one button that controls on/off and the temperature of the device. Holding down the button turns it on/off, while double clicking allows for temperature control. Above the button there is a series of lights that change depending on the temperature and indicate that the straighter is heating vs ready to use. While, as far as I can tell, this type of control set-up does work, the different temperatures are not noted on the device. I use the same temp every time, so this doesn't affect me as much, but, if you might need to adjust the heat, you'll have to check the instructions pamphlet for temp ranges.\n\nI have admittedly thin hair, but it is naturally curly. I had no problem straightening the majority with only one pass, but some of the more finicky bits, like my bedhead bangs, took a bit more finesse.\n\nAs a plus, this straightener did come with two hair clips to divide and twist up hair when straightening.

I have been using it for about 2 weeks, intermittently with other cleansers I use. I could not use this every day.  I found it to be rather drying and I do not have particularly dry skin.  One male reviewer said this was similar to engine degreaser I think were his words.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that but I do not find it to be a very gentle cleanser either.

If you like a squeaky clean feeling, or if you have rather oily skin then you may like this product.  Dry skin types or mature skin types will probably not prefer this cleanser.  Remember that stripping your skin of its protective barrier will only stimulate your skin to generate more oil to compensate.  Skin needs to retain it's barrier function.  It does foam nicely and one pump is more than adequate.  I did not find the scent overly citrus though I am not one of those people who are sensitive to scent.  It smelled pleasant but nothing remarkable IMO.  For my money I would not purchase this cleanser again.  I prefer the drug store brand Aveeno Sensitive Skin foaming cleanser.  Aveeno is about 1/3rd the price of this cleanser and my skin feels clean, and fresh without over stripping.

Say goodbye to razor bumps and ingrown hairs FOREVER! Trust me- I've tried dozens of pricey face washes, shaving creams, and after shaves over the last 4 years. If you don't want to commit so much money yet- order the pre/post shave proraso cream online, buy proraso shave cream online or at bath and body works (under their C.O.

I have a light/medium skin tone and this looked very unnatural/whited-out on me. The formula is also a little greasier than I would normally like in a lip balm, and I'd love to see it with a bit more wax, heavier oils, or even some powder fillers to give it a little more thickness and longevity and a more even application (since mineral sunscreens need to be on in a thick and even layer to protect, and I can see just how unevenly it's applying since it's so light on me). I have taken to applying this over a sheer matte pink-toned lip color to balance some of the whiteness out.

Not only to you need the brush to perform well, but be durable and stand up to cleaning.  Let's see how the Japonesque Kumadori Countour/Highlight Brush measures up.\n\nWHAT IS THIS BRUSH LIKE?\nThis brush is about 6 1/2\" long with the handle being 5\" and the brush head 1 1/2\" long.  The brush head is about 1 3/8\" wide at its widest point.  The shape of the brush is a teardrop shape.  The bristles are natural and they are not at all dense in the way they are packed.  I would put this more in the fluffy category and not dense.\n\nThe handle is tapered, but the base seems to be a rubbery base underneath.  A rim of that material is visible up near the base of the brush head.  The rest of the handle is wrapped with a natural piece of what resembles thin wicker.  I am not sure what the actual name of it is.  It is wrapped and glued down with the end tucked up under at the top.  It simply ends at the tip of the handle and is not tucked down.  The surface texture of the wrapped handle makes it easy to hold and manipulate in your hand, although in certain positions it can feel rough.\n\nHOW DOES THIS BRUSH PERFORM?\nAs for performance, this brush does not do too well picking up product from a pan unless the pan of makeup is very very soft and easily picked up.  It does not disperse the product as equally on the skin as I would like.  I have tried this with blush, bronzer and highlighter, but I find that it seems to work best with Guerlain Meteorites.\n\nThat is not necessarily a bad thing as Guerlain Meteorites are little balls of product which are in different colors.  It is hard to find a brush which applies them well.  They act more as a highlight or finishing powder in a very subtle manner.\n\nThis brush would also work decently with mineral makeup.  The tip makes it get into smaller spaces of the face like around the nose and inner eyes, but is broad enough to use on the rest of the face and under the chin.\n\nI did not find that the bristles were dense or sturdy enough to pick up sufficient product to apply to the skin evenly from pans of color such as contour or highlight.\n\nI tend to get better results from brushes in that same shape but much higher density than this one is.\n\nWHAT I DO NOT LIKE ABOUT THIS BRUSH\nMy biggest problem with this brush is that it is not going to be easy to clean.  Brushes are meant to be used and that means they will get dirty.  Sometimes handles will also get dirty.  In the case of this brush, the handle being wrapped by the wicker like pieces, I don't see this brush being easy to clean.  The bristles being wet only is possible, but any moisture at all on this handle is bound to make it come apart eventually.\n\nI imagine if you were to coat the handle with something that would withstand moisture, you could probably still use this brush and it would be more practical.  That way the handle would not unwrap with constant cleaning and you could still enjoy the brush.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nIf used for application of light powdery highlights or contour that is not packed hard in a pan, or sphere powders like Guerlain Meteorites, this brush would be good.  For use where you want to deposit color more evenly from pans of product, it is not the best brush. The composition of the handle makes it not practical to clean as if the handle becomes wet over time, the handle will probably come apart.  It you are a brush collector and love unusual brushes, and the practicality of this does not matter to you, then you might still love this brush.  If you are a practical person who uses their brushes a lot and likes to keep them clean all of the time, this might not be the brush for you.\n\nI have rated this two stars because I feel that it just isn't practical for makeup use that leads to lots of cleaning for that price."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-78160", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Pleasant to use, no issue with it.

You can feel them going over your skin and if there were more of them, I think my opinion of this product would be different.  But as it is now, a large percentage of your skin is never going to come into contact with one of the seeds as you use this, so most of your skin will not be exfoliated.  Since this is marketed as a scrub, that's a problem.\n\nThis is gentle and non-irritating when used a few times a week.  If you have sensitive skin and have had trouble with microdermabrasion-type scrubs, this could still work for you.  Please note that it has alpha hydroxy acids and so should be used in combination with a sunscreen.  It does rinse off cleanly and without leaving residue, as well.\n\nFor what it's worth, I'm having more breakouts with this than before I used it.  I don't necessarily think it is causing the breakouts, but the less-effective exfoliation (as opposed to my previous scrub product) is slowing turnover of my skin cells, which is what's causing my problems.\n\nIn the end, this may be worth a try if you have really sensitive skin.

Sounds like an oxymoron, but what I mean is that my hair strands themselves are very fine, but I have a lot of them. My hair is wavy/slightly curly and tends to frizz like madness each time I brush it. Every time I flat iron my hair, I have to be very careful because my hair tends to be dry and I have an ombre style color (brown on top, blonde on the bottom). My brown hair is more heat resistant while my blonde tends to fry in the flat iron. I've used many different heat protectants and I had high expectations with this one because of its' label and reviews. I am a licensed cosmetologist so my expectations for a product label are usually warranted. It gets two stars because it definitely protected my ends from frying in the iron like they normally do...however, this product is way too thick and greasy. Very heavy. After styling and using this product with my flat iron, I have noticed my hair becomes stiff and oily- not the typical carefree, soft, hair that blows freely in the wind. If the wind blew at my hair, it probably wouldn't move. And that cute hair flick we ladies like to do when we run our hands through our hair? Forget it. Not happening. If you do happen to get your fingers through your hair, you'll need to wash them afterwards as the sticky residue this product leaves on your hands is gross.\n\nMy suggestion: If you can find another product that is a great heat protectant for your hair, do so. If you have hair like mine that fries easily even with the best heat protectants, then use this serum but ONLY in very small quantities and ONLY on your ends.

Additionally, I wouldn't call it a \"Grandmother\" perfume. I could definitely see how some people could go there, but it's really too sharp, and too clean to be a \"grandmother\" perfume. I tend to gravitate towards sharp, edgy, slightly masculine (or unisex) scents. This is not that. The oak moss and fresh water I thought would do it for me (love oak moss), but really the base smells like equal parts White Flower/Liatris and Musk. The fresh water notes give it that clean somewhat sharp scent and the bergamot and oak moss are largely lost on me (particularly the bergamot). I would imagine that this would be suitable for a mature woman (meaning 40+) that wants to project an air of maturity and refinement (classic/reserved) who may like edgier flowery scents (not just a floral bouquet).\n\nIf you're into the edgier scent...that has similar notes, but is much younger you may wish to try Tokyo Milk's \"Age of Aquarius\" - Begamot, Iceland Moss, White Orchid, and Willow Bark.

I could have saved myself a hell of a lot of dough if I had tried Toppik sooner.  I cant compare it to other hair building fiber products on the market, because this is the only one I've tried.  I have tried colored dry shampoo though and this is superior in that it actually makes the area look fuller of hair, instead of just filled in with color at the scalp.  I got immediate responses of friends and family my hair looked great that day without realizing my new little secret.  I have dark brown hair and purchased Dark Brown Toppik, but unfortunately it is much more of a medium brown color and is quite noticeable if I sprinkle on too much.  For this reason I have to use it more sparingly than I would otherwise like to, and give it a good shake down to blend with my natural hair color.  I'm hesitant to try the Black because theres no real subjectivity to the color black.  Black is black and I see it being the same problem, only a darker shade to my hair rather than a lighter one.

The stress caused my skin to well up in a way I've never experienced before, and it was so tragic it actually distracted me from the break-up. My skin has never been clear, and I had experienced cystic bumps here and there prior to this incident. However, I looked like I had suffered an extreme chemical burn that blistered the entire lower portion of my face.\n\nPanicked, I went to Ulta to find makeup strong enough to cover my monstrous appearance yet gentle enough not to exasperate it. That's when I was directed to this Juice Beauty kit, in an effort to \"change the canvas, not paint over it\" as the Ulta rep (with flawless, glowing skin) put it. I bought it with extremely low expectations and extremely high chagrin.\n\nAbout a week later, I was put on Accutane. This is an extremely powerful medication for only the worst acne sufferers. My doctor forbade me from using any products that were not designed for sensitive skin, so I had to shelve my Juice Beauty kit.\n\nFlash forward to May. I took myself off Accutane because of the horrendous, non-acne related side effects (extreme hair loss, muscle weakness, depression). My skin now, however, is relatively clear, albeit scarred deeply on my cheeks. Since the drug stays in your system for a month after your last dosage, I had to wait before using anything not labeled \"sensitive skin\".\n\nNow it's June. I pulled out my Juice Beauty kit after two little pimples started sprouting on my face. I used the wash in the morning (I use a gentle, cream cleanser at night) and the serum at night under a heavy moisturizer. I used the peel once, and sporadically use the oil-free moisturizer. My pimples were gone in two days! I've also noticed that my scar tissue is less pronounced, as I believe the product is evening my skin tone.\n\nMy final thoughts: 1) Don't expect a miracle, especially if you have cystic acne. See a doctor. 2) This kit works best for people with acne-lite, meaning those irritating chicks that cry when they get a single spot on their faces. Basically, people who are non-acne sufferers that occasionally break out. 3) Best products in this kit are definitely the serum and the wash. They really do work, and they're gentle. I will definitely be repurchasing them. 4) The moisturizer leaves a bizarre, sticky finish and the peel felt pointless. Smelled, looked, and felt like applesauce. If you're into that, awesome, but those two products were let downs for me.\n\nHopefully this very thorough review helps some of y'all that are suffering. Believe me, I know what it's like. I simply think it's silly that some of the reviews on here are actually blaming the product for their acne... Acne comes from within 99% of the time, so you have to address that before any single product can help you.\n\nMuch love everyone! :)"}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-52822", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "this stuff was nice.

It straightens but it is comparable to a cheap straightener from a drug store. My hair is left somewhat straight and rough. The straightener is VERY light and feels all plastic!

I admit I did not try it on a small spot first as advised on the container.  I had read this when buying a couple weeks ago, but forgot about it by tonight.  No sign of any *skin* sensitivity so far, thank goodness, but the smell is overwhelming!\n\nThe actual odor is fine, it's how strong it is.  The list of ingredients on it is very long and with many chemicals.  Within a short time my throat started to feel raw and my eyes were a little irritated.  The smell became overwhelming - did not diminish as the product dried.\n\nFinally I had to try to wash it off my upper body.  This helped quite a bit.  If the leg application doesn't bother me, and the color is good, I may continue to use it only there.  But it simply is not on for any above waist application.  Thank goodness I didn't try it on my face!\n\nOthers may not have this sensitivity - I have always been sensitive to smells and suffer from dry eyes.  Just wanted to warn anyone else who might have the same problems to be warned.  For the sensitive I recommend Jergens.  It has always been the best self tanner on the market to get a bit of color, and now it beats the micro-mist tan since the new smell is a huge improvement.

The only thing was, lately I've been suspecting that it is not really non comedogenic (it doesn't promise that anyway) and is probably the only reason I still break out. (I noticed my skin gets bad any time I accidentally fall asleep in it.) So I decided to try to find a foundation that had all the same qualities (good natural color, stays on all day, stays matte, good coverage, not cakey) but won't clog my pores. This sounded like the closest thing. Even though it is triple the price, I figured it was worth it because since it has SPF 30, I could stop buying the expensive SPF 30 I usually put on under the Revlon since Revlon only contains an SPF 6. This foundation, besides promising to be non comedogenic, promises to stay put for 16 hours and stay matte. It did neither for me. I only tried it for two days because I wanted to be able to send it back if it wasn't working, but this is how it compared:\nColor: I'm in between super light and tan and sometimes use self tanners. So in Revlon I either use Sand Beige by itself or mix Sand Beige with a lighter color called Buff. Either way looks really good/natural on me and just depends how tan or non tan my body is. So with this one that only comes in a few colors, I bought the nude to try and figured if I liked it I would buy the lighter color opal and mix them when I need it to be lighter. Well, I didn't get that far, but the nude was a little too orange. I asked a friend and she thought it looked fine but I thought it looked too orange/tan to me. I also think it looked different in different lighting so sometimes looked worse than others.\n\nApplying: It definitely went on much lighter and thinner than Revlon Colorstay which was a plus and still covered everything: acne, scars, freckles, etc. And it dried very fast which I like. Sometimes the Revlon doesn't dry fast enough for me when I'm in a hurry to finish my routine. BUT even though it dried, it was shiny. When I powdered it, I may as well not have put any powder at all because it was still pretty shiny. Especially on my forehead and nose. But when I touched it, it was totally dry. So that was kind of weird. I never experienced anything like that before and that's not really a look I like. I've always liked matte looking skin but like my blush to be shimmery - only on my cheeks. When I powder the Revlon it becomes very matte.\n\nThroughout the day: I normally have an oily t zone and with the Revlon Colorstay, the oily t zone starts to come out after 4-5 hours and the rest of my face stays normal. I usually use Clean and Clear oil blotters which would take care of it for another several hours and not take the make up off at all. With the Vichy, I felt like my entire face was getting very oily after only an hour. It's a little hard to tell since it was shiny from the beginning but I definitely could feel a difference too. When I used the oil blotters, the make up actually came off in some spots onto the sheet. So it does not stay put as promised. By the end of my 9 hour work day my jawline was missing and forehead was spotty. (And it's supposed to last 16 hours.) That never happens with the Revlon Colorstay. The second day I tried powdering instead of oil blotting and it was still very spotty, maybe even worse.\n\nThe first day I put it on with nothing underneath. The second day I used a semi expensive mattifying primer on one side of my face and what I consider my very expensive mattifying sunscreen that I normally use, on the other side of my face, to see if it made a difference but it did not. Still super shiny and oily and did not stay entirely on for my 9 hour work day. I was very disappointed because I did go in with high hopes and not wanting to be a skeptic, but I didn't see a reason to test it for a 3rd day. I can't say whether or not it prevented break outs since I didn't use it long enough. I don't want to continue using Revlon Colorstay if it's going to continue to clog my pores so I'll still be searching for something that has all these qualities I need and have to use it in the meantime. Very disappointed.\n\nUpdate: I tried CoverGirl Ready Set Gorgeous foundation and so far I've been liking that one. It's oil free, non pore clogging. I've been using it for over a week and so far haven't had any new breakouts. I even slept in it once. Coverage is surprisingly pretty good, staying power is decent, comes in a wide variety of colors and was a lot more matte than Vichy. And best of all it was only $6.99 at Target. Revlon was still the best make up I've ever used in terms of staying power and staying matte but so far I like how the CoverGirl has many of the good qualities as well as not clogging my pores! And if you don't have acne, you don't need as much of it and won't end up going through the vicious cycle of pore clogging and covering! Highly recommend anyone who is acne prone & oily instead of Vichy."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-10458", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "smells like cinnamon and/or christmas candle-very spicy!

Being a veteran weeaboo, the first safety razor I tried was some legit Japanese stuff (forgot the brand, sorry) paired with Feather blades.  I have delicate, sensitive little girl's skin marred with big red-black thick quasi-Lovecraftian double-sprouting beard hairs; surely some sort of punishment for past-life atrocities.  After using the Japanese blades, my face was left as bloody as a Tarantino movie set in the after-hours.  I thought I'd get the hang of it with practice.  I didn't, and ended up giving up and going back to selling my internal organs in order to afford Mach 3 razors.\n\nSince moving to Germany, my second attempt was this Merkur 23C, with its weird blade wings thingie.  I used Astra blades because I found an affordable 100-pack at Amazon.de.  The combo works well enough.  The only thing I can't achieve with it is the mythical \"one-stroke shaving\" which wet shaving forums on the Internet preach of.  Like, apparently you're supposed to caress your face with a single Meistestroke with, while following the grain, would close-shave all your beard hairs in one go even as they clean the foam elegantly like an enlightened Zen swordsmonk sweeping a rock garden, leaving nary a shade behind. If stubble is  left at all, it means you suck, but you're allowed to lather up again and draw a second, shameful stroke at a right angle to the grain.  If even then there are still hairs left, you can do a final, desperate stroke against the grain, and then presumably live-stream your seppuku for TheShaveDen elders.\n\nNo matter how I try it, after three strokes not even Jesus would be generous enough to call my face anywhere near \"shaved\".  My shaving process end up looking more like Jackson Pollock's \"Autumn Rhythm\", with dozens of strokes going upwards, downwards, diagonalwards, irregularly around facial features, in Golden Ratio spirals etc.  Despite all this abuse, this razor does not leave me burned or bleeding at all, which I take to be quite the achievement.  It doesn't achieve a close shave either, but then again neither does Mach 3, which costs ten gazillion dollars in the long-term and also makes me bleed a whole lot.\n\nOne day I'll save big bucks, go to some laser hair removal shop of renown, burn every. single. strand of beard hair back to the pits of Hell where they came from, and then post it on Art of Manliness to troll masculinity-worshippers.

For years I wasn't able to wear any nail polish at all due to the chemicals in nail polish causing me to have skin break outs. Gel Manicures would not cause my skin to have the same reaction as 'regular' nail polish but it was really hard on my nails causing flaking, breakage, and it would not last longer than a week or so.\n\nNow I keep my nails shorter and do not like the look of polished nails. I feel like most polish makes nails look fake, and even with the use of gel polish I have ridges in my nails. About 14 years ago I got a very bad splinter under my thumb nail that was so deep it went to the base of my nail, and required the nail to be removed in order to remove the wood splinter. Since that event, I have had what I call a 'nail scar' which is actually a very deep noticeable nail ridge/scar in my nail from having that splinter removed. Even gel polish would not cover the ridge I have in my thumb nail.\n\nI decided to use this kit since I have had such great results with Zoya Nail Polish in the past, and was very happy with the results I got on the very first use. It dries more quickly than other Zoya polishes, and has made my nails very smooth. The ridge in my thumb nail while not completely covered is almost completely invisible; more so than it ever was with gel polish or other types of manicure kits.\n\nI expected liner strips with the kit similar to what is included with french manicure kits to aid in creating the natural white nail tip, but this was not included. Although I have found it difficult to create white tips without the use of guides the polish included with this kit made it relatively easy. One of the reasons I gave this nail kit 4 stars was because of the added time required to add the tips, but honestly for someone that is not a very good at applying polish this was still very easy.\n\nThe other reason I did not give a full 5 stars was because the kit promises to remove nail ridges, this was not the case for me. My 'nail scar' although not completely covered was covered better than any other product I have used as I stated above. Women that have not had such bad trauma to their nails will probably have complete coverage of their nail ridges. Other than the one ridge in my thumb nail, the coverage is excellent, and I was very surprised with the natural look of my nails after using the kit.\n\nI also have a problem with the tips of my nails fraying, and this kit has made the fraying of my nail tips completely invisible and smooth. I have only used this kit one time, and I am truly impressed with the results. I will continue to use this naked manicure kit, and update my review with continued use. This manicure kit truly does make your nails look natural, healthy, and untouched. Perhaps after several uses the ridge in my thumb nail will be completely invisible.

Enough of that, let's move on to  the review part.  I'm hypothyroid & take Armour.  I'm not sure if it was that condition, alopecia areata or my low Ferritin level (21) but my eyelashes had fallen out in clumps on one eye & both eyes a few times over the past couple years.  This last time was the worst, they also dropped to about half the length.  They were so short it was difficult to even get them in my eyelash curler. You don't realize what eyelashes do for your eyes until you are without them.  I looked tired all the time, I was depressed & embarrassed.  I had to apply individual lashes because I looked crazy & the amount of time that added to my daily routine was a real pain.  I had started taking iron supplements & have more than doubled my Ferritin level.  According to my endo & google searches optimal level is 70 & below that can cause hair loss.  (Please don't read this & start taking iron supplements without getting your levels checked by a physician as you can become sick & cause other health issues.)  I had also just started using this product.  I want to be clear that while getting my Ferritin level up may have helped this product seems to be like Miracle Gro for my lashes.  They are longer & fuller than they ever were in about a month.  I have dry eyes (thanks thyroid) and the first few days GrandeLASH MD did seem to irritate them & I almost gave up but after a few days my eyes were fine.  I'm so glad I kept at it.  I am 44 so according to the directions I apply at night after I wash my face & then again in the morning after I wash my face & before any makeup. For less than $20 a month it's so worth it.  I keep checking the mirror to be sure my lashes are still there.  They actually look like I have my individual lashes on.  I couldn't be more happy & relieved.

As some one who has had melanoma, skin protection from UVA/UVB is very important to me - more important than anti-aging. However, I figured since this product has both I would see how I liked it. I don't. First some things that I did like:\n\nPros:\n- (so far) has not caused a reaction to my skin, which other sun screen/sun block lotions can sometimes do\n- the tint - on me, anyway - seems to blend in okay with my skin coloring. Not too light, not too dark, not too \"orange.\"\n- this does make the imperfections in my skin seem much less noticeable, and provides a smooth skin tone\n- it promises a SPF 50, which is probably more than adequate for facial protection\n- it has a matte finish, no \"shininess.\"\n\nCons:\n- this product is the consistency of toothpaste. As recommended, I tried rubbing it in my hands to \"soften,\" but that did not work and it was an enormous bother.\n- because of the consistency of the product, putting it on my skin was not easy. I had to really rub it in to get it to absorb and blend - and pulling / tugging on delicate facial skin certainly doesn't aid in the aging process.\n- once it is on my skin I feel as though I have a mask on. While it doesn't feel heavy, exactly, it feels as though my skin has a layer over it.\n- this could possibly make a very good sun screen - except the instructions state it must be added every 2 hours. I can only imagine what this would feel like after several applications.\n- after putting this product on my face, it is very difficult to wash off my hands and fingers - even with hot water and soap.\n\nOverall, while this product may be very effective at blocking UVA/UVB, I simply do not like the way it makes my skin feel. I normally do not wear facial make-up - just moisturizer and sun screen - so having something that feels \"cake-y\" and like a mask feels too strange. Also, my face does feel as though it is moisturized, and that is important to me, being in my mid-50s. I could see this being a great product if I were on a hike or spending quite a bit of time in the sun. But, then the heavy, paste-like substance makes the prospect uninviting. I would be more inclined to wear a moisturizer with SPF 15 or 30 and to wear a hat.

Lip exfoliation is one of the simplest, most inexpensive beauty routines one can engage in at home because it only requires two basic ingredients that virtually every household has on hand: sugar and oil.\n\nSpecifically, all that is required to exfoliate the lips is a tiny amount of granular sugar, either white table sugar (sucrose as in this product), brown sugar,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/raw-sugar/dp/B000EA3M4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">raw sugar</a>, or sugar alcohol such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/xylitol/dp/B001EO6852/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">xylitol</a>. Add to that an equal amount of any food-grade oil you have on hand in the house, for example: olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil, or coconut oil. One-fourth teaspoon each of granular sugar and oil is enough to do both lips.\n\nThe instructions for do-it-yourself exfoliation are as follows:\n\nIn a small bowl or saucer, measure out one-fourth teaspoon of granular sugar. On top of it put an equal amount of oil. Wash your hands and dry them thoroughly. Blend the sugar and oil together with the tip of your finger. Rub the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips in a circular motion for two-five minutes. Gently scrub off the mixture with a clean, damp washcloth to remove not only the sugar and oil, but any loosened, dead skin. If flaking, dead skin still remains on your lips, rub more of the sugar-oil mixture onto your lips and repeat the above process. After you are finished, immediately moisturize your lips, ideally with a natural, food-grade oil or a lip balm made with an oil-beeswax mixture, since anything that goes on the lips ultimately ends up in the mouth and stomach.\n\nThe second problem with this product is that even though the container looks small, there is enough of this product to last a very long time. And while it is sitting on your bathroom shelf, it is slowly drying out. Within six months to a year, long before you've used more than a fraction of it, this product will deteriorate into a hard, unusable lump (not to mention that most cosmetics companies recommend throwing out their products anyway within six to nine months because of inevitable bacteria buildup). If you make your own sugar-oil mixture each time you need it, nothing is wasted, and it is always fresh, with a smooth, viscous consistency that glides onto your lips.\n\nThe third problem with this product is that, though some of the ingredients are natural and food-grade, others are not. The ingredients for this product include: \"Sucrose, Petrolatum, Flavor, Caramel, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, VitiVinifera (Grape) Seed Oil.\" Below is a description of each ingredient. The most problematic one is petrolatum. It is too bad that the makers of this product didn't just stick to grapeseed oil, which is a natural, healthy oil.\n\nSucrose is simple white/table sugar.\n\nPetrolatum: This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" This is a very thick substance which is anything but ideal for exfoliating the skin.\n\nFlavor: It is not specified whether this is \"artificial\" or \"natural\" flavor. Artificial flavor is derived from non-food substances, that is, chemicals created in a lab. Natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is unexplained. In both cases, there is no way to know how safe or healthy the flavoring is.\n\nCaramel: This is sugar or syrup heated until it turns brown. It can either be used as a coloring agent or to impart flavor.\n\nJojoba oil is a natural plant oil. It is created from the liquid wax of the seed of the jojoba plant, a shrub which is native to southern Arizona, southern California, and northwestern Mexico. It's much healthier than petrolatum, but it contains 14% erucic acid, which is not recommended to be taken internally.\n\nGrapeseed oil is a natural oil derived from the seeds of grape. It contains vitamin E and antioxidants."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Positive"]}, "id": "data-34809", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Not as quick as I expected."}, "predictions": [{"result": [{"value": {"choices": ["Negative"]}, "id": "data-12832", "from_name": "sentiment", "to_name": "text", "type": "choices"}]}]}, {"data": {"text": "Love it but don't like the smell.

I am considering other alternatives.\n\n--\n\nFYI - price estimate: If you are doing your arms in addition to the rest of your body (my arm hair is white so it would have no effect, as is the hair on my outer thighs) then I would guess one cartridge would give you one and a half passes for arms, underarms, legs and bikini.  You'd probably need 6 total to do your entire body the recommended number of times (I believe it's first four treatments 2 weeks apart, next three treatments 3-4 weeks apart, and then treatments as needed and only in specific areas, but it is all in the book you get with the kit), and then another 1-2 for any extra maintenance or trouble areas that may be causing trouble, so that gives you a better idea of pricing overall.\n\n--\n\nDay 1 - January 4: \"All I know is I got shot by a laser. Gosh darnit, my *censored* hurts. You're right about it being like a rubber band.\" -Boyfriend wanted to use it, too. He shot my legs, underarms, and bikini area. It actually melted any stubble so I believe it was working the right way. Make sure you shave the day before. He used the 5 the whole time on me, per my request, as I read a lot of reviews that said it only works at that level. It really did feel like a rubber band. Basically the softer tissue was when it hurt. I hardly felt it on my legs or stomach, mostly just my inner thighs. I also felt it around my knees while they were bent, but when I stretched out it was fine (book says don't laser skin that's not tight, so this is apparently why). We are thinking about the white eyeliner tip for round 2, as one of the issues was it was very hard to keep track of where we were. Thus far, it didn't seem to cause any irritation. Best part: the sound effects. Pew pew!\n\nDay 2 - January 20: Thus far, I've noticed I definitely had to shave in between.  My hair was still growing, and it was still coming in with no noticeable difference - to me.  However, not to be discouraged, we tried again!  Online articles said to expect only 10% of hair gone for any sort of laser hair removal.  During the process, my boyfriend used the singed bits of stubble as a sort of guide, and he also pressed down a bit harder as he went to leave a minor impression and keep track of where he had been.  We did my legs (only the inside of my thighs and then all of my lower legs) and under my arms, and then he also shot a few areas on his body.  He said that not a lot of hair has grown back from the areas he did.  One spot was a mole, but I did still notice a couple hairs.  He did one of my underarms twice on accident, so we'll compare the two and see if this is a positive strategy - that's for next time!  Keep you posted. (Also, the light is quite bright.  I hid my head under a blanket both this time and last, and my boyfriend was wearing sun glasses.  One of the other reviewers said they bought special glasses.  I don't think it's necessary for such a small procedure, but if you're doing multiple people or for some reason will need way more treatments or if you're actually doing your entire body, then at least wear sun glasses but please consider special glasses.  Come on, it's your eyes.)\n\nDay 3 - January 26: I don't really see a difference, but it's only the third treatment now. It may be my imagination, but some of the hair seemed thinner.  The instructions say to go every two weeks for the first few treatments, but my hair was starting to grow back and I had to shave Friday for the weekend, so we decided to have at it.  Hopefully my last $10 razor purchase!  My boyfriend said there was a noticeable difference between my two underarms, so I suppose it was a happy accident that we did one twice.  It meant a lot more overlap where the laser hit, which is where I think the real benefit was.  Because of this, he did both of my underarms twice today.  However, please note I DO NOT recommend doing this as it did leave minor burn marks after the second time, and the second time also hurt and felt burning - but come on, if you're zapping your skin on highest intensity TWICE then you better expect it!  However, it really just looks reddish, and it's just under my arms so no one sees it anyway.  A little lotion or aloe and it will be fine.  Also, I could smell the burning hair.  I definitely would NOT do my legs that way! We made it through one lower leg and then had to switch the laser cartridge to the second one. (Two per initial box.)  So, that means that one cartridge made it down both my legs twice (plus one more leg) and under my arms twice, and then did my bikini line twice and a couple spots on my boyfriend twice.  I have some BAD NEWS, though.  The little laser got really hot - which is part of the reason it burned me a bit more today and hurt more than it had before - and then it stopped working.  We were not misusing it, so I believe it was just a defective unit.  It's not a big deal since Amazon's return policy is solid.  I am going to send it back for a refund rather than a replacement because I don't know if it is really working or not.  However, if it is actually working, I will buy a new one and get back on it!  I'm going to give it two weeks and then reevaluate the status of my hair.  It sounds silly but I took a picture of my underarm today so I can actually compare.\n\nFinal update: After a series of three photos (the final a month after returning the device), I realized there was little to no hair loss.
